 adventures of sherlock holmes adventure i a scandal in bohemia i to sherlock holmes she is always _the_ woman. i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler. all emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. he was, i take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. they were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. and yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene adler, of dubious and questionable memory. i had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us away from each other. my own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention; while holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. he was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland. beyond these signs of his activity, however, which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion. one night—it was on the 20th of march, 1888—i was returning from a journey to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through baker street. as i passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i looked up, i saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. he was at work again. he had arisen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. i rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. his manner was not effusive. it seldom was; but he was glad, i think, to see me. with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then he stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. “wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “i think, watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you.” “seven!” i answered. “indeed, i should have thought a little more. just a trifle more, i fancy, watson. and in practice again, i observe. you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.” “then, how do you know?” “i see it, i deduce it. how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?” “my dear holmes,” said i, “this is too much. you would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as i have changed my clothes, i can’t imagine how you deduce it. as to mary jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there, again, i fail to see how you work it out.” he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. “it is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey. as to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.” i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “when i hear you give your reasons,” i remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled, until you explain your process. and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours.” “quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an arm-chair. “you see, but you do not observe. the distinction is clear. for example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.” “frequently.” “how often?” “well, some hundreds of times.” “then how many are there?” “how many? i don’t know.” “quite so! you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is just my point. now, i know that there are seventeen steps, because i have both seen and observed. by-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” he threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “it came by the last post,” said he. “read it aloud.” the note was undated, and without either signature or address. “there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. this account of you we have from all quarters received. be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.” “this is indeed a mystery,” i remarked. “what do you imagine that it means?” “i have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. but the note itself. what do you deduce from it?” i carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. “the man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” i remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion’s processes. “such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarly strong and stiff.” “peculiar—that is the very word,” said holmes. “it is not an english paper at all. hold it up to the light.” i did so, and saw a large _e_ with a small _g_, a _p_, and a large _g_ with a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper. “what do you make of that?” asked holmes. “the name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.” “not at all. the _g_ with the small _t_ stands for ‘gesellschaft,’ which is the german for ‘company.’ it is a customary contraction like our ‘co.’ _p_, of course, stands for ‘papier.’ now for the _eg_. let us glance at our continental gazetteer.” he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “eglow, eglonitz—here we are, egria. it is in a german-speaking country—in bohemia, not far from carlsbad. ‘remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. “the paper was made in bohemia,” i said. “precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘this account of you we have from all quarters received.’ a frenchman or russian could not have written that. it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs. it only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. and here he comes, if i am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.” as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. holmes whistled. “a pair, by the sound,” said he. “yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. a hundred and fifty guineas apiece. there’s money in this case, watson, if there is nothing else.” “i think that i had better go, holmes.” “not a bit, doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without my boswell. and this promises to be interesting. it would be a pity to miss it.” “but your client—” “never mind him. i may want your help, and so may he. here he comes. sit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.” a slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. then there was a loud and authoritative tap. “come in!” said holmes. [illustration: “a man entered”] a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. his dress was rich with a richness which would, in england, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. he carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. “you had my note?” he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent. “i told you that i would call.” he looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. “pray take a seat,” said holmes. “this is my friend and colleague, dr. watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. whom have i the honor to address?” “you may address me as the count von kramm, a bohemian nobleman. i understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor and discretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. if not, i should much prefer to communicate with you alone.” i rose to go, but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. “it is both, or none,” said he. “you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.” the count shrugged his broad shoulders. “then i must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history.” “i promise,” said holmes. “and i.” “you will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own.” “i was aware of it,” said holmes, dryly. “the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe. to speak plainly, the matter implicates the great house of ormstein, hereditary kings of bohemia.” “i was also aware of that,” murmured holmes, settling himself down in his arm-chair and closing his eyes. our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe. holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. “if your majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “i should be better able to advise you.” the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “you are right,” he cried; “i am the king. why should i attempt to conceal it?” “why, indeed?” murmured holmes. “your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and hereditary king of bohemia.” “but you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, “you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. i have come _incognito_ from prague for the purpose of consulting you.” “then, pray consult,” said holmes, shutting his eyes once more. “the facts are briefly these: some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, irene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you.” “kindly look her up in my index, doctor,” murmured holmes, without opening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. “let me see!” said holmes. “hum! born in new jersey in the year 1858. contralto—hum! la scala, hum! prima donna imperial opera of warsaw—yes! retired from operatic stage—ha! living in london—quite so! your majesty, as i understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.” “precisely so. but how—” “was there a secret marriage?” “none.” “no legal papers or certificates?” “none.” “then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?” “there is the writing.” “pooh, pooh! forgery.” “my private note-paper.” “stolen.” “my own seal.” “imitated.” “my photograph.” “bought.” “we were both in the photograph.” “oh dear! that is very bad! your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.” “i was mad—insane.” “you have compromised yourself seriously.” “i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now.” “it must be recovered.” “we have tried and failed.” “your majesty must pay. it must be bought.” “she will not sell.” “stolen, then.” “five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twice she has been waylaid. there has been no result.” “no sign of it?” “absolutely none.” holmes laughed. “it is quite a pretty little problem,” said he. “but a very serious one to me,” returned the king, reproachfully. “very, indeed. and what does she propose to do with the photograph?” “to ruin me.” “but how?” “i am about to be married.” “so i have heard.” “to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen, second daughter of the king of scandinavia. you may know the strict principles of her family. she is herself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.” “and irene adler?” “threatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. i know that she will do it. you do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. she has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. rather than i should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.” “you are sure that she has not sent it yet?” “i am sure.” “and why?” “because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday.” “oh, then, we have three days yet,” said holmes, with a yawn. “that is very fortunate, as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. your majesty will, of course, stay in london for the present?” “certainly. you will find me at the langham, under the name of the count von kramm.” “then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.” “pray do so. i shall be all anxiety.” “then, as to money?” “you have _carte blanche_.” “absolutely?” “i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.” “and for present expenses?” the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. “there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said. holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. “and mademoiselle’s address?” he asked. “is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john’s wood.” holmes took a note of it. “one other question,” said he. “was the photograph a cabinet?” “it was.” “then, good-night, your majesty, and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. and good-night, watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “if you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o’clock, i should like to chat this little matter over with you.” ii at three o’clock precisely i was at baker street, but holmes had not yet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. i sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. i was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. it was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. accustomed as i was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he. with a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed heartily for some minutes. “well, really!” he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. “what is it?” “it’s quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning, or what i ended by doing.” “i can’t imagine. i suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of miss irene adler.” “quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell you, however. i left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning, in the character of a groom out of work. there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. i soon found briony lodge. it is a _bijou_ villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. chubb lock to the door. large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open. behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. “i then lounged down the street, and found, as i expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and i received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as i could desire about miss adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom i was not in the least interested, but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to.” “and what of irene adler?” i asked. “oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say the serpentine-mews, to a man. she lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. he is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. he is a mr. godfrey norton, of the inner temple. see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. when i had listened to all that they had to tell, i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. “this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. he was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? if the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. if the latter, it was less likely. on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the temple. it was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. i fear that i bore you with these details, but i have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.” “i am following you closely,” i answered. “i was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. he was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom i had heard. he appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home. “he was in the house about half an hour, and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. of her i could see nothing. presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. as he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly. ‘drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to gross & hankey’s in regent street, and then to the church of st. monica in the edgware road. half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’ “away they went, and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. it hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. “‘the church of st. monica, john,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ “this was quite too good to lose, watson. i was just balancing whether i should run for it, or whether i should perch behind her landau, when a cab came through the street. the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare; but i jumped in before he could object. ‘the church of st. monica,’ said i, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ it was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. “my cabby drove fast. i don’t think i ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived. i paid the man and hurried into the church. there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me.” “thank god!” he cried. “you’ll do. come! come!” “what then?” i asked. “come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.” “i was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before i knew where i was, i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which i knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler, spinster, to godfrey norton, bachelor. it was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. it seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign, and i mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.” “this is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said i; “and what then?” “well, i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. at the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. ‘i shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said, as she left him. i heard no more. they drove away in different directions, and i went off to make my own arrangements.” “which are?” “some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “i have been too busy to think of food, and i am likely to be busier still this evening. by the way, doctor, i shall want your co-operation.” “i shall be delighted.” “you don’t mind breaking the law?” “not in the least.” “nor running a chance of arrest?” “not in a good cause.” “oh, the cause is excellent!” “then i am your man.” “i was sure that i might rely on you.” “but what is it you wish?” “when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you. now,” he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, “i must discuss it while i eat, for i have not much time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must be on the scene of action. miss irene, or madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her.” “and what then?” “you must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is to occur. there is only one point on which i must insist. you must not interfere, come what may. you understand?” “i am to be neutral?” “to do nothing whatever. there will probably be some small unpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my being conveyed into the house. four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. you are to station yourself close to that open window.” “yes.” “you are to watch me, for i will be visible to you.” “yes.” “and when i raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what i give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. you quite follow me?” “entirely.” “it is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “it is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. your task is confined to that. when you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. you may then walk to the end of the street, and i will rejoin you in ten minutes. i hope that i have made myself clear?” “i am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.” “precisely.” “then you may entirely rely on me.” “that is excellent. i think, perhaps, it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play.” he disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman. his broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could have equalled. it was not merely that holmes changed his costume. his expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. it was a quarter past six when we left baker street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue. it was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes’s succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private that i expected. on the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. there was a group of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths. “you see,” remarked holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. the photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. now the question is, where are we to find the photograph?” “where, indeed?” “it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it is cabinet size. too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. two attempts of the sort have already been made. we may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.” “where, then?” “her banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. but i am inclined to think neither. women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. why should she hand it over to any one else? she could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. it must be where she can lay her hands upon it. it must be in her own house.” “but it has twice been burgled.” “pshaw! they did not know how to look.” “but how will you look?” “i will not look.” “what then?” “i will get her to show me.” “but she will refuse.” “she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it is her carriage. now carry out my orders to the letter.” as he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge. as it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. a fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. irene adler, as i will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. “is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “he is dead,” cried several voices. “no, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “but he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.” “he’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “they would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. they were a gang, and a rough one, too. ah, he’s breathing now.” “he can’t lie in the street. may we bring him in, marm?” “surely. bring him into the sitting-room. there is a comfortable sofa. this way, please!” slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room, while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. the lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch. i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. i hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. after all, i thought, we are not injuring her. we are but preventing her from injuring another. holmes had sat up upon the couch, and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open the window. at the same instant i saw him raise his hand, and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “fire!” the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of “fire!” thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. i caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgware road. “you did it very nicely, doctor,” he remarked. “nothing could have been better. it is all right.” “you have the photograph?” “i know where it is.” “and how did you find out?” “she showed me, as i told you that she would.” “i am still in the dark.” “i do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “the matter was perfectly simple. you, of course, saw that every one in the street was an accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening.” “i guessed as much.” “then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. i rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick.” “that also i could fathom.” “then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what else could she do? and into her sitting-room, which was the very room which i suspected. it lay between that and her bedroom, and i was determined to see which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.” “how did that help you?” “it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. it is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and i have more than once taken advantage of it. in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the arnsworth castle business. a married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it. the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. when i cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and i have not seen her since. i rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. a little over-precipitance may ruin all.” “and now?” i asked. “our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the king to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands.” “and when will you call?” “at eight in the morning. she will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. i must wire to the king without delay.” we had reached baker street, and had stopped at the door. he was searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said: “good-night, mister sherlock holmes.” there were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. “i’ve heard that voice before,” said holmes, staring down the dimly-lit street. “now, i wonder who the deuce that could have been.” iii i slept at baker street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room. “you have really got it!” he cried, grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face. “not yet.” “but you have hopes?” “i have hopes.” “then, come. i am all impatience to be gone.” “we must have a cab.” “no, my brougham is waiting.” “then that will simplify matters.” we descended, and started off once more for briony lodge. “irene adler is married,” remarked holmes. “married! when?” “yesterday.” “but to whom?” “to an english lawyer named norton.” “but she could not love him?” “i am in hopes that she does.” “and why in hopes?” “because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. if the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. if she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty’s plan.” “it is true. and yet—well! i wish she had been of my own station! what a queen she would have made!” he relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue. the door of briony lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. “mr. sherlock holmes, i believe?” said she. “i am mr. holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze. “indeed! my mistress told me that you were likely to call. she left this morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from charing cross for the continent.” “what!” sherlock holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. “do you mean that she has left england?” “never to return.” “and the papers?” asked the king, hoarsely. “all is lost.” “we shall see.” he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. the furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “sherlock holmes, esq. to be left till called for.” my friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. it was dated at midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way: “my dear mr. sherlock holmes,—you really did it very well. you took me in completely. until after the alarm of fire, i had not a suspicion. but then, when i found how i had betrayed myself, i began to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i had been told that, if the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became suspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress myself. male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to watch you, ran up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as i call them, and came down just as you departed. “well, i followed you to your door, and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock holmes. then i, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the temple to see my husband. “we both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. as to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king may do what he will without hinderance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and i remain, dear mr. sherlock holmes, very truly yours, irene norton, _née_ adler.” “what a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the king of bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. “did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity that she was not on my level?” “from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty,” said holmes, coldly. “i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty’s business to a more successful conclusion.” “on the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the king; “nothing could be more successful. i know that her word is inviolate. the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.” “i am glad to hear your majesty say so.” “i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i can reward you. this ring—” he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. “your majesty has something which i should value even more highly,” said holmes. “you have but to name it.” “this photograph!” the king stared at him in amazement. “irene’s photograph!” he cried. “certainly, if you wish it.” “i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in the matter. i have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.” he bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. * * * * * and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman’s wit. he used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but i have not heard him do it of late. and when he speaks of irene adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable title of _the_ woman. adventure ii the red-headed league i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. with an apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw, when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. “you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson,” he said, cordially. “i was afraid that you were engaged.” “so i am. very much so.” “then i can wait in the next room.” “not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.” the stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small, fat-encircled eyes. “try the settee,” said holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “i know, my dear watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.” “your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” i observed. “you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.” “a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.” “you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to. perhaps, mr. wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. i ask you, not merely because my friend dr. watson has not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. as a rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events, i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.” the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his great-coat. as he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his knee, i took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance. i did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. he wore rather baggy gray shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. altogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features. sherlock holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else.” mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion. “how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?” he asked. “how did you know, for example, that i did manual labor. it’s as true as gospel, for i began as a ship’s carpenter.” “your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.” “well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?” “i won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.” “ah, of course, i forgot that. but the writing?” “what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk.” “well, but china?” “the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.” mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. “well, i never!” said he. “i thought at first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was nothing in it, after all.” “i begin to think, watson,” said holmes, “that i make a mistake in explaining. ‘omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?” “yes, i have got it now,” he answered, with his thick, red finger planted half-way down the column. “here it is. this is what began it all. you just read it for yourself, sir.” i took the paper from him, and read as follows: “to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins, of lebanon, pa., u.s.a., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. apply in person on monday, at eleven o’clock, to duncan ross, at the offices of the league, 7 pope’s court, fleet street.” “what on earth does this mean?” i ejaculated, after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement. holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. “it is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he. “and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date.” “it is _the morning chronicle_, of april 27, 1890. just two months ago.” “very good. now, mr. wilson?” “well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes,” said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; “i have a small pawnbroker’s business at coburg square, near the city. it’s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to learn the business.” “what is the name of this obliging youth?” asked sherlock holmes. “his name is vincent spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. it’s hard to say his age. i should not wish a smarter assistant, mr. holmes; and i know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what i am able to give him. but, after all, if he is satisfied, why should i put ideas in his head?” “why, indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price. it is not a common experience among employers in this age. i don’t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.” “oh, he has his faults, too,” said mr. wilson. “never was such a fellow for photography. snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develope his pictures. that is his main fault; but, on the whole, he’s a good worker. there’s no vice in him.” “he is still with you, i presume?” “yes, sir. he and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking, and keeps the place clean—that’s all i have in the house, for i am a widower, and never had any family. we live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do nothing more. “the first thing that put us out was that advertisement. spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says: “‘i wish to the lord, mr. wilson, that i was a red-headed man.’ “‘why that?’ i asks. “‘why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the league of the red-headed men. it’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. if my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’ “‘why, what is it, then?’ i asked. you see, mr. holmes, i am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. in that way i didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and i was always glad of a bit of news. “‘have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men?’ he asked, with his eyes open. “‘never.’ “‘why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.’ “‘and what are they worth?’ i asked. “‘oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’ “well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy. “‘tell me all about it,’ said i. “‘well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. as far as i can make out, the league was founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. he was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color. from all i hear it is splendid pay, and very little to do.’ “‘but,’ said i, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.’ “‘not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘you see it is really confined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had started from london when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. then, again, i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. now, if you cared to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’ “now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met. vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful, so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me. he was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement. “i never hope to see such a sight as that again, mr. holmes. from north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. fleet street was choked with red-headed folk, and pope’s court looked like a coster’s orange barrow. i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange, brick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. when i saw how many were waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.” “your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. “pray continue your very interesting statement.” “there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. however, when our turn came, the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us. “‘this is mr. jabez wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league.’ “‘and he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘he has every requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine.’ he took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success. “‘it would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘you will, however, i am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ with that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain. ‘there is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me. ‘i perceive that all is as it should be. but we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. i could tell you tales of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ he stepped over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager. “‘my name,’ said he, ‘is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. are you a married man, mr. wilson? have you a family?’ “i answered that i had not. “his face fell immediately. “‘dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! i am sorry to hear you say that. the fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’ “my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right. “‘in the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours. when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’ “‘well, it is a little awkward, for i have a business already,’ said i. “‘oh, never mind about that, mr. wilson!’ said vincent spaulding. ‘i shall be able to look after that for you.’ “‘what would be the hours?’ i asked. “‘ten to two.’ “now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, mr. holmes, especially thursday and friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. besides, i knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up. “‘that would suit me very well,’ said i. ‘and the pay?’ “‘is £4 a week.’ “‘and the work?’ “‘is purely nominal.’ “‘what do you call purely nominal?’ “‘well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. if you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. the will is very clear upon that point. you don’t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’ “‘it’s only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving,’ said i. “‘no excuse will avail,’ said mr. duncan ross, ‘neither sickness nor business nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your billet.’ “‘and the work?’ “‘is to copy out the “encyclopædia britannica.” there is the first volume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready to-morrow?’ “‘certainly,’ i answered. “‘then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.’ he bowed me out of the room, and i went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good fortune. “well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i could not imagine. it seemed altogether past belief that any one could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the ‘encyclopædia britannica.’ vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. however, in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow, so i bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, i started off for pope’s court. “well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. the table was set out ready for me, and mr. duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work. he started me off upon the letter a, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. at two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that i had written, and locked the door of the office after me. “this went on day after day, mr. holmes, and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. it was the same next week, and the same the week after. every morning i was there at ten, and every afternoon i left at two. by degrees mr. duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. still, of course, i never dared to leave the room for an instant, for i was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that i would not risk the loss of it. “eight weeks passed away like this, and i had written about abbots and archery and armor and architecture and attica, and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b’s before very long. it cost me something in foolscap, and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end.” “to an end?” “yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here it is, and you can read for yourself.” he held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of note-paper. it read in this fashion: “the red-headed league is dissolved. _october 9, 1890._” sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter. “i cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “if you can do nothing better than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere.” “no, no,” cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. “i really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. it is most refreshingly unusual. but there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?” “i was staggered, sir. i did not know what to do. then i called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. finally, i went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red-headed league. he said that he had never heard of any such body. then i asked him who mr. duncan ross was. he answered that the name was new to him. [illustration: “the door was shut and locked”] “‘well,’ said i, ‘the gentleman at no. 4.’ “‘what, the red-headed man?’ “‘yes.’ “‘oh,’ said he, ‘his name was william morris. he was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. he moved out yesterday.’ “‘where could i find him?’ “‘oh, at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes, 17 king edward street, near st. paul’s.’ “i started off, mr. holmes, but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross.” “and what did you do then?” asked holmes. “i went home to saxe-coburg square, and i took the advice of my assistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough, mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, i came right away to you.” “and you did very wisely,” said holmes. “your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.” “grave enough!” said mr. jabez wilson. “why, i have lost four pound a week.” “as far as you are personally concerned,” remarked holmes, “i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on the contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some £30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them.” “no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. it was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.” “we shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. and, first, one or two questions, mr. wilson. this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?” “about a month then.” “how did he come?” “in answer to an advertisement.” “was he the only applicant?” “no, i had a dozen.” “why did you pick him?” “because he was handy, and would come cheap.” “at half-wages, in fact.” “yes.” “what is he like, this vincent spaulding?” “small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he’s not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.” holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “i thought as much,” said he. “have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?” “yes, sir. he told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad.” “hum!” said holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “he is still with you?” “oh yes, sir; i have only just left him.” “and has your business been attended to in your absence?” “nothing to complain of, sir. there’s never very much to do of a morning.” “that will do, mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. to-day is saturday, and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion.” “well, watson,” said holmes, when our visitor had left us, “what do you make of it all?” “i make nothing of it,” i answered, frankly. “it is a most mysterious business.” “as a rule,” said holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. but i must be prompt over this matter.” “what are you going to do, then?” i asked. “to smoke,” he answered. “it is quite a three-pipe problem, and i beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” he curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece. “sarasate plays at the st. james’s hall this afternoon,” he remarked. “what do you think, watson? could your patients spare you for a few hours?” “i have nothing to do to-day. my practice is never very absorbing.” “then put on your hat and come. i am going through the city first, and we can have some lunch on the way. i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than italian or french. it is introspective, and i want to introspect. come along!” we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. it was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with “jabez wilson” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in. “thank you,” said holmes, “i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand.” “third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly, closing the door. “smart fellow, that,” observed holmes, as we walked away. “he is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in london, and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. i have known something of him before.” “evidently,” said i, “mr. wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red-headed league. i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.” “not him.” “what then?” “the knees of his trousers.” “and what did you see?” “what i expected to see.” “why did you beat the pavement?” “my dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. we are spies in an enemy’s country. we know something of saxe-coburg square. let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.” the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. it was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west. the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. it was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted. “let me see,” said holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along the line, “i should like just to remember the order of the houses here. it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london. there is mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and mcfarlane’s carriage-building depot. that carries us right on to the other block. and now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.” my friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes, the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. when i saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at st. james’s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down. “you want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked, as we emerged. “yes, it would be as well.” “and i have some business to do which will take some hours. this business at coburg square is serious.” “why serious?” “a considerable crime is in contemplation. i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. but to-day being saturday rather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night.” “at what time?” “ten will be early enough.” “i shall be at baker street at ten.” “very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” he waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd. [illustration: “all afternoon he sat in the stalls”] i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbors, but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the “encyclopædia” down to the visit to saxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. what was this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed? where were we going, and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. i tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation. it was a quarter past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park, and so through oxford street to baker street. two hansoms were standing at the door, and, as i entered the passage, i heard the sound of voices from above. on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognized as peter jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat. “ha! our party is complete,” said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “watson, i think you know mr. jones, of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr. merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.” “we’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said jones, in his consequential way. “our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.” “i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,” observed mr. merryweather, gloomily. “you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes, sir,” said the police agent, loftily. “he has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.” “oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right,” said the stranger, with deference. “still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber.” “i think you will find,” said sherlock holmes, “that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be some £30,000; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.” “john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he’s a young man, mr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he’s a remarkable man, is young john clay. his grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to eton and oxford. his brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. he’ll crack a crib in scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next. i’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.” “i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i’ve had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom, watson and i will follow in the second.” sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive, and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farringdon street. “we are close there now,” my friend remarked. “this fellow merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought it as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positive virtue. he is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon any one. here we are, and they are waiting for us.” we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. this also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. mr. merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. “you are not very vulnerable from above,” holmes remarked, as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. “nor from below,” said mr. merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. “why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise. “i must really ask you to be a little more quiet,” said holmes, severely. “you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?” the solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in his pocket. “we have at least an hour before us,” he remarked; “for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. we are at present, doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks. mr. merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.” “it is our french gold,” whispered the director. “we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.” “your french gold?” “yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and borrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france. it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.” “which were very well justified,” observed holmes. “and now it is time that we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. in the mean time, mr. merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.” “and sit in the dark?” “i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and i thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber after all. but i see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. and, first of all, we must choose our positions. these are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. i shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. then, when i flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. if they fire, watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.” i placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. to me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault. “they have but one retreat,” whispered holmes. “that is back through the house into saxe-coburg square. i hope that you have done what i asked you, jones?” “i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.” “then we have stopped all the holes. and now we must be silent and wait.” what a time it seemed! from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs were weary and stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light. at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones. its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair. “it’s all clear,” he whispered. “have you the chisel and the bags. great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i’ll swing for it!” sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor. “it’s no use, john clay,” said holmes, blandly. “you have no chance at all.” “so i see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness. “i fancy that my pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails.” “there are three men waiting for him at the door,” said holmes. “oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i must compliment you.” “and i you,” holmes answered. “your red-headed idea was very new and effective.” “you’ll see your pal again presently,” said jones. “he’s quicker at climbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies.” “i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins. have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’” “all right,” said jones, with a stare and a snigger. “well, would you please, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station?” “that is better,” said john clay, serenely. he made a sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective. “really mr. holmes,” said mr. merryweather, as we followed them from the cellar, “i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.” “i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john clay,” said holmes. “i have been at some small expense over this matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league.” * * * * * “you see, watson,” he explained, in the early hours of the morning, as we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in baker street, “it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying of the ‘encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. the method was no doubt suggested to clay’s ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice’s hair. the £4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.” “but how could you guess what the motive was?” “had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man’s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what could it be? i thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end of this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant, and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london. he was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. what could it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building. “so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of burrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i walked round the corner, saw that the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend’s premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.” “and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” i asked. “well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night.” “you reasoned it out beautifully,” i exclaimed, in unfeigned admiration. “it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.” “it saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “alas! i already feel it closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. these little problems help me to do so.” “and you are a benefactor of the race,” said i. he shrugged his shoulders. “well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,” he remarked. “‘l’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est tout,’ as gustave flaubert wrote to georges sand.” adventure iii a case of identity “my dear fellow,” said sherlock holmes, as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. if we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.” “and yet i am not convinced of it,” i answered. “the cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.” “a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked holmes. “this is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.” i smiled and shook my head. “i can quite understand you thinking so,” i said. “of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. but here”—i picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. here is the first heading upon which i come. ‘a husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ there is half a column of print, but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. there is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.” “indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “this is the dundas separation case, and, as it happens, i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. the husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example.” he held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it. “ah,” said he, “i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks. it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers.” “and the ring?” i asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger. “it was from the reigning family of holland, though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.” “and have you any on hand just now?” i asked, with interest. “some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. they are important, you understand, without being interesting. indeed, i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. in these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. it is possible, however, that i may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or i am much mistaken.” he had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted london street. looking over his shoulder, i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess-of-devonshire fashion over her ear. from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgetted with her glove buttons. suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell. “i have seen those symptoms before,” said holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_. she would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. and yet even here we may discriminate. when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.” as he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into an arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him. “do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much type-writing?” “i did at first,” she answered, “but now i know where the letters are without looking.” then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. “you’ve heard about me, mr. holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?” “never mind,” said holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things. perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook. if not, why should you come to consult me?” “i came to you, sir, because i heard of you from mrs. etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him up for dead. oh, mr. holmes, i wish you would do as much for me. i’m not rich, but still i have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that i make by the machine, and i would give it all to know what has become of mr. hosmer angel.” “why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked sherlock holmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling. again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland. “yes, i did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr. windibank—that is, my father—took it all. he would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and i just on with my things and came right away to you.” “your father,” said holmes, “your step-father, surely, since the name is different.” “yes, my step-father. i call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.” “and your mother is alive?” “oh yes, mother is alive and well. i wasn’t best pleased, mr. holmes, when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. father was a plumber in the tottenham court road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with mr. hardy, the foreman; but when mr. windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. they got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.” i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention. “your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?” “oh no, sir. it is quite separate, and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland. it is in new zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent. two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but i can only touch the interest.” “you interest me extremely,” said holmes. “and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60.” [illustration: “sherlock holmes welcomed her”] “i could do with much less than that, mr. holmes, but you understand that as long as i live at home i don’t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them. of course, that is only just for the time. mr. windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over to mother, and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at type-writing. it brings me twopence a sheet, and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.” “you have made your position very clear to me,” said holmes. “this is my friend, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr. hosmer angel.” a flush stole over miss sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “i met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,” she said. “they used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. mr. windibank did not wish us to go. he never did wish us to go anywhere. he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat. but this time i was set on going, and i would go; for what right had he to prevent? he said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father’s friends were to be there. and he said that i had nothing fit to wear, when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer. at last, when nothing else would do, he went off to france upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and i, with mr. hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there i met mr. hosmer angel.” “i suppose,” said holmes, “that when mr. windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.” “oh, well, he was very good about it. he laughed, i remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.” “i see. then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as i understand, a gentleman called mr. hosmer angel.” “yes, sir. i met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, mr. holmes, i met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and mr. hosmer angel could not come to the house any more.” “no?” “well, you know, father didn’t like anything of the sort. he wouldn’t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. but then, as i used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and i had not got mine yet.” “but how about mr. hosmer angel? did he make no attempt to see you?” “well, father was going off to france again in a week, and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. we could write in the mean time, and he used to write every day. i took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.” “were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?” “oh yes, mr. holmes. we were engaged after the first walk that we took. hosmer—mr. angel—was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street—and—” “what office?” “that’s the worst of it, mr. holmes, i don’t know.” “where did he live, then?” “he slept on the premises.” “and you don’t know his address?” “no—except that it was leadenhall street.” “where did you address your letters, then?” “to the leadenhall street post-office, to be left till called for. he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so i offered to type-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us. that will just show you how fond he was of me, mr. holmes, and the little things that he would think of.” “it was most suggestive,” said holmes. “it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. can you remember any other little things about mr. hosmer angel?” “he was a very shy man, mr. holmes. he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. very retiring and gentlemanly he was. even his voice was gentle. he’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. he was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.” “well, and what happened when mr. windibank, your step-father, returned to france?” “mr. hosmer angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should marry before father came back. he was in dreadful earnest, and made me swear, with my hands on the testament, that whatever happened i would always be true to him. mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. mother was all in his favor from the first, and was even fonder of him than i was. then, when they talked of marrying within the week, i began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. i didn’t quite like that, mr. holmes. it seemed funny that i should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but i didn’t want to do anything on the sly, so i wrote to father at bordeaux, where the company has its french offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.” “it missed him, then?” “yes, sir; for he had started to england just before it arrived.” “ha! that was unfortunate. your wedding was arranged, then, for the friday. was it to be in church?” “yes, sir, but very quietly. it was to be at st. saviour’s, near king’s cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st. pancras hotel. hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. we got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked, there was no one there! the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. that was last friday, mr. holmes, and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.” “it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said holmes. “oh no, sir! he was too good and kind to leave me so. why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, i was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, i was always to remember that i was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. it seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.” “most certainly it does. your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?” “yes, sir. i believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. and then i think that what he foresaw happened.” “but you have no notion as to what it could have been?” “none.” “one more question. how did your mother take the matter?” “she was angry, and said that i was never to speak of the matter again.” “and your father? did you tell him?” “yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that i should hear of hosmer again. as he said, what interest could any one have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but hosmer was very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of mine. and yet, what could have happened? and why could he not write? oh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and i can’t sleep a wink at night.” she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to sob heavily into it. “i shall glance into the case for you,” said holmes, rising; “and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. above all, try to let mr. hosmer angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.” “then you don’t think i’ll see him again?” “i fear not.” “then what has happened to him?” “you will leave that question in my hands. i should like an accurate description of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.” “i advertised for him in last saturday’s _chronicle_,” said she. “here is the slip, and here are four letters from him.” “thank you. and your address?” “no. 31 lyon place, camberwell.” “mr. angel’s address you never had, i understand. where is your father’s place of business?” “he travels for westhouse & marbank, the great claret importers of fenchurch street.” “thank you. you have made your statement very clearly. you will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which i have given you. let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.” “you are very kind, mr. holmes, but i cannot do that. i shall be true to hosmer. he shall find me ready when he comes back.” for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned. sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face. “quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “i found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. you will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at the hague last year. old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. but the maiden herself was most instructive.” “you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” i remarked. “not invisible, but unnoticed, watson. you did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. i can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. now, what did you gather from that woman’s appearance? describe it.” “well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right forefinger. her boots i didn’t observe. she had small, round, hanging gold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.” sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled. “’pon my word, watson, you are coming along wonderfully. you have really done very well indeed. it is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for color. never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. my first glance is always at a woman’s sleeve. in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. as you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. the double line a little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. the sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. i then glanced at her face, and observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, i ventured a remark upon short sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.” “it surprised me.” “but, surely, it was very obvious. i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.” “and what else?” i asked, keenly interested, as i always was, by my friend’s incisive reasoning. “i noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home, but after being fully dressed. you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. she had written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep. it must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. all this is amusing, though rather elementary, but i must go back to business, watson. would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr. hosmer angel?” i held the little printed slip to the light. “missing,” it said, “on the morning of the 14th, a gentleman named hosmer angel. about 5 ft. 7 in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold albert chain, and gray harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street. anybody bringing,” etc., etc. “that will do,” said holmes. “as to the letters,” he continued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. absolutely no clew in them to mr. angel, save that he quotes balzac once. there is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.” “they are type-written,” i remarked. “not only that, but the signature is type-written. look at the neat little ‘hosmer angel’ at the bottom. there is a date, you see, but no superscription except leadenhall street, which is rather vague. the point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.” “of what?” “my dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?” “i cannot say that i do, unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.” “no, that was not the point. however, i shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. one is to a firm in the city, the other is to the young lady’s step-father, mr. windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. and now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.” i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. once only had i known him to fail, in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph; but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet, i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel. i left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland. a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. it was not until close upon six o’clock that i found myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street, half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery. i found sherlock holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his arm-chair. a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him. “well, have you solved it?” i asked, as i entered. “yes. it was the bisulphate of baryta.” “no, no, the mystery!” i cried. “oh, that! i thought of the salt that i have been working upon. there was never any mystery in the matter, though, as i said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. the only drawback is that there is no law, i fear, that can touch the scoundrel.” “who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland?” the question was hardly out of my mouth, and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a tap at the door. “this is the girl’s step-father, mr. james windibank,” said holmes. “he has written to me to say that he would be here at six. come in!” the man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating gray eyes. he shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair. “good-evening, mr. james windibank,” said holmes. “i think that this type-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o’clock?” “yes, sir. i am afraid that i am a little late, but i am not quite my own master, you know. i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. it was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. of course, i did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel?” “on the contrary,” said holmes, quietly; “i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr. hosmer angel.” mr. windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. “i am delighted to hear it,” he said. “it is a curious thing,” remarked holmes, “that a type-writer has really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. now, you remark in this note of yours, mr. windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ there are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.” “we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes. “and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study, mr. windibank,” holmes continued. “i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to crime. it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention. i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. they are all type-written. in each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well.” mr. windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. “i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, mr. holmes,” he said. “if you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.” “certainly,” said holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. “i let you know, then, that i have caught him!” “what! where?” shouted mr. windibank, turning white to his lips, and glancing about him like a rat in a trap. “oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said holmes, suavely. “there is no possible getting out of it, mr. windibank. it is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. that’s right! sit down, and let us talk it over.” our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter of moisture on his brow. “it—it’s not actionable,” he stammered. “i am very much afraid that it is not. but between ourselves, windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if i go wrong.” the man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us. “the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. it was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. it was worth an effort to preserve it. the daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her step-father do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. but soon he found that that would not answer forever. she became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. what does her clever step-father do then? he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short sight, he appears as mr. hosmer angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.” [illustration: “glancing about him like a rat in a trap”] “it was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “we never thought that she would have been so carried away.” “very likely not. however that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her step-father was in france, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. she was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. then mr. angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go, if a real effect were to be produced. there were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards any one else. but the deception could not be kept up forever. these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous. the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady’s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. as far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. i think that that was the chain of events, mr. windibank!” our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face. “it may be so, or it may not, mr. holmes,” said he, “but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. i have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.” “the law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. if the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. by jove!” he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and i think i shall just treat myself to—” he took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see mr. james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road. “there’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. “that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. the case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.” “i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” i remarked. “well, of course it was obvious from the first that this mr. hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the step-father. then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the smallest sample of it. you see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.” “and how did you verify them?” “having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. i knew the firm for which this man worked. having taken the printed description, i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and i sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. i had already noticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and i wrote to the man himself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. as i expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. the same post brought me a letter from westhouse & marbank, of fenchurch street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, james windibank. _voila tout!_” “and miss sutherland?” “if i tell her she will not believe me. you may remember the old persian saying, ‘there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace, and as much knowledge of the world.” adventure iv the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and i, when the maid brought in a telegram. it was from sherlock holmes, and ran in this way: “have you a couple of days to spare? have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy. shall be glad if you will come with me. air and scenery perfect. leave paddington by the 11.15.” “what do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “will you go?” “i really don’t know what to say. i have a fairly long list at present.” “oh, anstruther would do your work for you. you have been looking a little pale lately. i think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in mr. sherlock holmes’s cases.” “i should be ungrateful if i were not, seeing what i gained through one of them,” i answered. “but if i am to go, i must pack at once, for i have only half an hour.” my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. my wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to paddington station. sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap. “it is really very good of you to come, watson,” said he. “it makes a considerable difference to me, having some one with me on whom i can thoroughly rely. local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets.” we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him. among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past reading. then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and tossed them up onto the rack. “have you heard anything of the case?” he asked. “not a word. i have not seen a paper for some days.” “the london press has not had very full accounts. i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. it seems, from what i gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.” “that sounds a little paradoxical.” “but it is profoundly true. singularity is almost invariably a clew. the more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is it to bring it home. in this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.” “it is a murder, then?” “well, it is conjectured to be so. i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it. i will explain the state of things to you, as far as i have been able to understand it, in a very few words. “boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross, in herefordshire. the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr. john turner, who made his money in australia, and returned some years ago to the old country. one of the farms which he held, that of hatherley, was let to mr. charles mccarthy, who was also an ex-australian. the men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. turner was apparently the richer man, so mccarthy became his tenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. mccarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. they appear to have avoided the society of the neighboring english families, and to have led retired lives, though both the mccarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighborhood. mccarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl. turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families. now for the facts. “on june 3, that is, on monday last, mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the boscombe pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley. he had been out with his serving-man in the morning at ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. from that appointment he never came back alive. “from hatherley farm-house to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. one was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was william crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of mr. turner. both these witnesses depose that mr. mccarthy was walking alone. the game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr. mccarthy pass he had seen his son, mr. james mccarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. to the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred. “the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. the boscombe pool is thickly-wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. a girl of fourteen, patience moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the boscombe valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. she states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, mr. mccarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. she heard mr. mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. she had hardly said the words when young mr. mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. he was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on tuesday, he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross, who have referred the case to the next assizes. those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.” “i could hardly imagine a more damning case,” i remarked. “if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.” “circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered holmes, thoughtfully. “it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. it must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. there are several people in the neighborhood, however, and among them miss turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.” “i am afraid,” said i, “that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.” “there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered, laughing. “besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr. lestrade. you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. to take the first example to hand, i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet i question whether mr. lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.” “how on earth—” “my dear fellow, i know you well. i know the military neatness which characterizes you. you shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less well illuminated than the other. i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and being satisfied with such a result. i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. therein lies my _métier_, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.” [illustration: “they found the body”] “what are they?” “it appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to hatherley farm. on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.” “it was a confession,” i ejaculated. “no, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.” “coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.” “on the contrary,” said holmes, “it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds. however innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. as to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. the self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind, rather than of a guilty one.” i shook my head. “many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,” i remarked. “so they have. and many men have been wrongfully hanged.” “what is the young man’s own account of the matter?” “it is, i am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. you will find it here, and may read it for yourself.” he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read it very carefully. it ran in this way: “mr. james mccarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and gave evidence as follows: ‘i had been away from home for three days at bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday, the 3rd. my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb, the groom. shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though i was not aware in which direction he was going. i then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren which is upon the other side. on my way i saw william crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father. i had no idea that he was in front of me. when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of “cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. i then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there. a conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, i left him, and returned towards hatherley farm. i had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when i heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. i found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. i dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. i knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to mr. turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. i saw no one near my father when i returned, and i have no idea how he came by his injuries. he was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far as i know, no active enemies. i know nothing further of the matter.’ “the coroner: did your father make any statement to you before he died? “witness: he mumbled a few words, but i could only catch some allusion to a rat. “the coroner: what did you understand by that? “witness: it conveyed no meaning to me. i thought that he was delirious. “the coroner: what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel? “witness: i should prefer not to answer. “the coroner: i am afraid that i must press it. “witness: it is really impossible for me to tell you. i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed. “the coroner: that is for the court to decide. i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise. “witness: i must still refuse. “the coroner: i understand that the cry of ‘cooee’ was a common signal between you and your father? “witness: it was. “the coroner: how was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol? “witness (with considerable confusion): i do not know. “a juryman: did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured? “witness: nothing definite. “the coroner: what do you mean? “witness: i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open, that i could think of nothing except of my father. yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. it seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. when i rose from my father i looked round for it, but it was gone. “‘do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’ “‘yes, it was gone.’ “‘you cannot say what it was?’ “‘no, i had a feeling something was there.’ “‘how far from the body?’ “‘a dozen yards or so.’ “‘and how far from the edge of the wood?’ “‘about the same.’ “‘then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?’ “‘yes, but with my back towards it.’ “this concluded the examination of the witness.” “i see,” said i, as i glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy. he calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father’s dying words. they are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.” holmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. “both you and the coroner have been at some pains,” said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s favor. don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little. too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. no, sir, i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. and now here is my pocket petrarch, and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action. we lunch at swindon, and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.” it was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful stroud valley, and over the broad gleaming severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross. a lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, i had no difficulty in recognizing lestrade, of scotland yard. with him we drove to the hereford arms, where a room had already been engaged for us. “i have ordered a carriage,” said lestrade, as we sat over a cup of tea. “i knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.” “it was very nice and complimentary of you,” holmes answered. “it is entirely a question of barometric pressure.” lestrade looked startled. “i do not quite follow,” he said. “how is the glass? twenty-nine, i see. no wind, and not a cloud in the sky. i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to-night.” lestrade laughed indulgently. “you have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “the case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. still, of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. she had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done. why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.” he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life. her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern. “oh, mr. sherlock holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, “i am so glad that you have come. i have driven down to tell you so. i know that james didn’t do it. i know it, and i want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. never let yourself doubt upon that point. we have known each other since we were little children, and i know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.” “i hope we may clear him, miss turner,” said sherlock holmes. “you may rely upon my doing all that i can.” “but you have read the evidence. you have formed some conclusion? do you not see some loophole, some flaw? do you not yourself think that he is innocent?” “i think that it is very probable.” “there, now!” she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly at lestrade. “you hear! he gives me hopes.” lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said. “but he is right. oh! i know that he is right. james never did it. and about his quarrel with his father, i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it.” “in what way?” asked holmes. “it is no time for me to hide anything. james and his father had many disagreements about me. mr. mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. so there were quarrels, and this, i am sure, was one of them.” “and your father?” asked holmes. “was he in favor of such a union?” “no, he was averse to it also. no one but mr. mccarthy was in favor of it.” a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her. “thank you for this information,” said he. “may i see your father if i call to-morrow?” “i am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.” “the doctor?” “yes, have you not heard? poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. he has taken to his bed, and dr. willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is shattered. mr. mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria.” “ha! in victoria! that is important.” “yes, at the mines.” “quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as i understand, mr. turner made his money.” “yes, certainly.” “thank you, miss turner. you have been of material assistance to me.” “you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. no doubt you will go to the prison to see james. oh, if you do, mr. holmes, do tell him that i know him to be innocent.” “i will, miss turner.” “i must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if i leave him. good-bye, and god help you in your undertaking.” she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street. “i am ashamed of you, holmes,” said lestrade, with dignity, after a few minutes’ silence. “why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? i am not over-tender of heart, but i call it cruel.” “i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy,” said holmes. “have you an order to see him in prison?” “yes, but only for you and me.” “then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out. we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night?” “ample.” “then let us do so. watson, i fear that you will find it very slow, but i shall only be away a couple of hours.” i walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. the puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and i found my attention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that i at last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. supposing that this unhappy young man’s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? it was something terrible and deadly. what could it be? might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? i rang the bell, and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. in the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. i marked the spot upon my own head. clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. that was to some extent in favor of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. still, it might be worth while to call holmes’s attention to it. then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. what could that mean? it could not be delirium. a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. no, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. but what could it indicate? i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. and then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young mccarthy. if that were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! i did not wonder at lestrade’s opinion, and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes’s insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy’s innocence. it was late before sherlock holmes returned. he came back alone, for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town. “the glass still keeps very high,” he remarked, as he sat down. “it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. on the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. i have seen young mccarthy.” “and what did you learn from him?” “nothing.” “could he throw no light?” “none at all. i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it, and was screening him or her, but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as every one else. he is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at, and, i should think, sound at heart.” “i cannot admire his taste,” i remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner.” “ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. this fellow is madly, insanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol, and marry her at a registry office? no one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to miss turner. on the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol, and his father did not know where he was. mark that point. it is of importance. good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered.” “but if he is innocent, who has done it?” “ah! who? i would call your attention very particularly to two points. one is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the pool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. and now let us talk about george meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.” there was no rain, as holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. at nine o’clock lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool. “there is serious news this morning,” lestrade observed. “it is said that mr. turner, of the hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.” “an elderly man, i presume?” said holmes. “about sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. this business has had a very bad effect upon him. he was an old friend of mccarthy’s, and, i may add, a great benefactor to him, for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free.” “indeed! that is interesting,” said holmes. “oh yes! in a hundred other ways he has helped him. everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.” “really! does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son to turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? it is the more strange, since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea. the daughter told us as much. do you not deduce something from that?” “we have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said lestrade, winking at me. “i find it hard enough to tackle facts, holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.” “you are right,” said holmes, demurely; “you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.” “anyhow, i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,” replied lestrade, with some warmth. “and that is—” “that mccarthy, senior, met his death from mccarthy, junior, and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.” “well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said holmes, laughing. “but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left.” “yes, that is it.” it was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the gray walls. the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. we called at the door, when the maid, at holmes’s request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had then had. having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool. [illustration: “the maid showed us the boots.”] sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognize him. his face flushed and darkened. his brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. his face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool. it was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. sometimes holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little _détour_ into the meadow. lestrade and i walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end. the boscombe pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner. above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner’s dwelling. on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. to holmes, as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. he ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion. “what did you go into the pool for?” he asked. “i fished about with a rake. i thought there might be some weapon or other trace. but how on earth—” “oh, tut, tut! i have no time! that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. a mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. oh, how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all over it. here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. but here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” he drew out a lens, and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “these are young mccarthy’s feet. twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. that bears out his story. he ran when he saw his father on the ground. then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down. what is this, then? it is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. and this? ha, ha! what have we here? tiptoes! tiptoes! square, too, quite unusual boots! they come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak. now where did they come from?” he ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighborhood. holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. for a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and examining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. a jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all traces were lost. “it has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning to his natural manner. “i fancy that this gray house on the right must be the lodge. i think that i will go in and have a word with moran, and perhaps write a little note. having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. you may walk to the cab, and i shall be with you presently.” it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back into ross, holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood. “this may interest you, lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “the murder was done with it.” “i see no marks.” “there are none.” “how do you know, then?” “the grass was growing under it. it had only lain there a few days. there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. it corresponds with the injuries. there is no sign of any other weapon.” “and the murderer?” “is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. there are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.” lestrade laughed. “i am afraid that i am still a sceptic,” he said. “theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed british jury.” “_nous verrons_,” answered holmes, calmly. “you work your own method, and i shall work mine. i shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to london by the evening train.” “and leave your case unfinished?” “no, finished.” “but the mystery?” “it is solved.” “who was the criminal, then?” “the gentleman i describe.” “but who is he?” “surely it would not be difficult to find out. this is not such a populous neighborhood.” lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “i am a practical man,” he said, “and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg. i should become the laughing-stock of scotland yard.” “all right,” said holmes, quietly. “i have given you the chance. here are your lodgings. good-bye. i shall drop you a line before i leave.” having left lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position. “look here, watson,” he said, when the cloth was cleared; “just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. i don’t quite know what to do, and i should value your advice. light a cigar, and let me expound.” “pray do so.” “well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favor and you against him. one was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry ‘cooee!’ before seeing him. the other was his singular dying reference to a rat. he mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s ear. now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.” “what of this ‘cooee!’ then?” “well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. the son, as far as he knew, was in bristol. it was mere chance that he was within ear-shot. the ‘cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. but ‘cooee’ is a distinctly australian cry, and one which is used between australians. there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was some one who had been in australia.” “what of the rat, then?” sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. “this is a map of the colony of victoria,” he said. “i wired to bristol for it last night.” he put his hand over part of the map. “what do you read?” he asked. “arat,” i read. “and now?” he raised his hand. “ballarat.” “quite so. that was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. he was trying to utter the name of his murderer. so-and-so, of ballarat.” “it is wonderful!” i exclaimed. “it is obvious. and now, you see, i had narrowed the field down considerably. the possession of a gray garment was a third point which, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a gray cloak.” “certainly.” “and one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.” “quite so.” “then comes our expedition of to-day. by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.” “but how did you gain them?” “you know my method. it is founded upon the observance of trifles.” “his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. his boots, too, might be told from their traces.” “yes, they were peculiar boots.” “but his lameness?” “the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. he put less weight upon it. why? because he limped—he was lame.” “but his left-handedness.” “you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. the blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. he had even smoked there. i found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled me to pronounce as an indian cigar. i have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. having found the ash, i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. it was an indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam.” “and the cigar-holder?” “i could see that the end had not been in his mouth. therefore he used a holder. the tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so i deduced a blunt pen-knife.” “holmes,” i said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. i see the direction in which all this points. the culprit is—” “mr. john turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor. the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. his slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. his tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease. “pray sit down on the sofa,” said holmes, gently. “you had my note?” “yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.” “i thought people would talk if i went to the hall.” “and why did you wish to see me?” he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered. “yes,” said holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “it is so. i know all about mccarthy.” the old man sank his face in his hands. “god help me!” he cried. “but i would not have let the young man come to harm. i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes.” “i am glad to hear you say so,” said holmes, gravely. “i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. it would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested.” “it may not come to that,” said holmes. “what!” “i am no official agent. i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and i am acting in her interests. young mccarthy must be got off, however.” “i am a dying man,” said old turner. “i have had diabetes for years. my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month. yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a jail.” holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. “just tell us the truth,” he said. “i shall jot down the facts. you will sign it, and watson here can witness it. then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy. i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.” “it’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether i shall live to the assizes, so it matters little to me, but i should wish to spare alice the shock. and now i will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell. “you didn’t know this dead man, mccarthy. he was a devil incarnate. i tell you that. god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. his grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. i’ll tell you first how i came to be in his power. “it was in the early sixties at the diggings. i was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; i got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. there were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. black jack of ballarat was the name i went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang. “one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. there were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. i put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man mccarthy. i wish to the lord that i had shot him then, but i spared him, though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. we got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to england without being suspected. there i parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. i bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and i set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which i had earned it. i married, too, and though my wife died young, she left me my dear little alice. even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. in a word, i turned over a new leaf, and did my best to make up for the past. all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me. “i had gone up to town about an investment, and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot. “‘here we are, jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as good as a family to you. there’s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. if you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country is england, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’ “well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. there was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where i would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. it grew worse as alice grew up, for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was i gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which i could not give. he asked for alice. “his son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as i was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. but there i was firm. i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that i had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. i stood firm. mccarthy threatened. i braved him to do his worst. we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over. “when i went down there i found him talking with his son, so i smoked a cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. could i not snap the bond? i was already a dying and a desperate man. though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, i knew that my own fate was sealed. but my memory and my girl! both could be saved, if i could but silence that foul tongue. i did it, mr. holmes. i would do it again. deeply as i have sinned, i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer. i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. his cry brought back his son; but i had gained the cover of the wood, though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight. that is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.” “well, it is not for me to judge you,” said holmes, as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. “i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.” “i pray not, sir. and what do you intend to do?” “in view of your health, nothing. you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes. i will keep your confession, and, if mccarthy is condemned, i shall be forced to use it. if not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.” “farewell, then,” said the old man, solemnly. “your own death-beds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.” tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room. “god help us!” said holmes, after a long silence. “why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter’s words, and say, ‘there, but for the grace of god, goes sherlock holmes.’” james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes, on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes, and submitted to the defending counsel. old turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past. adventure v the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years ’82 and ’90, i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. there is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up. the year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which i retain the records. among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber, of the amateur mendicant society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the british bark _sophy anderson_, of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa, and finally of the camberwell poisoning case. in the latter, as may be remembered, sherlock holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. all these i may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe. it was in the latter days of september, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. as evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell’s fine sea-stories, until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. my wife was on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street. “why,” said i, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell. who could come to-night? some friend of yours, perhaps?” “except yourself i have none,” he answered. “i do not encourage visitors.” “a client, then?” “if so, it is a serious case. nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady’s.” sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a new-comer must sit. “come in!” said he. the man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. the steaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety. “i owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden _pince-nez_ to his eyes. “i trust that i am not intruding. i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.” “give me your coat and umbrella,” said holmes. “they may rest here on the hook, and will be dry presently. you have come up from the south-west, i see.” “yes, from horsham.” “that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe-caps is quite distinctive.” “i have come for advice.” “that is easily got.” “and help.” “that is not always so easy.” “i have heard of you, mr. holmes. i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal.” “ah, of course. he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.” “he said that you could solve anything.” “he said too much.” “that you are never beaten.” “i have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a woman.” “but what is that compared with the number of your successes?” “it is true that i have been generally successful.” “then you may be so with me.” “i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with some details as to your case.” “it is no ordinary one.” “none of those which come to me are. i am the last court of appeal.” “and yet i question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.” “you fill me with interest,” said holmes. “pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.” the young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze. “my name,” said he, “is john openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as i can understand it, little to do with this awful business. it is an hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, i must go back to the commencement of the affair. “you must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle elias and my father joseph. my father had a small factory at coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. he was the patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome competence. “my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man, and became a planter in florida, where he was reported to have done very well. at the time of the war he fought in jackson’s army, and afterwards under hood, where he rose to be a colonel. when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe, and took a small estate in sussex, near horsham. he had made a very considerable fortune in the states, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them. he was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town. he had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. he drank a great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother. “he didn’t mind me, in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so. this would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in england. he begged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me in his way. when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house. i kept all the keys, and could go where i liked and do what i liked, so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy. there was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. with a boy’s curiosity i have peeped through the key-hole, but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room. “one day—it was in march, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel’s plate. it was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘from india!’ said he, as he took it up, ‘pondicherry postmark! what can this be?’ opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. i began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. his lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the color of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. ‘k. k. k.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘my god, my god, my sins have overtaken me!’ “‘what is it, uncle?’ i cried. “‘death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. i took up the envelope, and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter k three times repeated. there was nothing else save the five dried pips. what could be the reason of his overpowering terror? i left the breakfast-table, and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cash-box, in the other. “‘they may do what they like, but i’ll checkmate them still,’ said he, with an oath. ‘tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to fordham, the horsham lawyer.’ “i did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room. the fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. as i glanced at the box i noticed, with a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope. “‘i wish you, john,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. i leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. if you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! if you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but i can’t say what turn things are going to take. kindly sign the paper where mr. fordham shows you.’ “i signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. the singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and i pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. i could see a change in my uncle, however. he drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy, and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. when these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. at such times i have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin. “well, to come to an end of the matter, mr. holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. we found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. there was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. but i, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. the matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some £14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.” “one moment,” holmes interposed. “your statement is, i foresee, one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened. let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.” “the latter arrived on march 10, 1883. his death was seven weeks later, upon the night of may 2d.” “thank you. pray proceed.” “when my father took over the horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. we found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. on the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of k. k. k. repeated upon it, and ‘letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’ written beneath. these, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw. for the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in america. some of them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty well, and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the north. “well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the january of ’85. on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. there he was, sitting with a newly-opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. he had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-a-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself. “‘why, what on earth does this mean, john?’ he stammered. “my heart had turned to lead. ‘it is k. k. k.,’ said i. “he looked inside the envelope. ‘so it is,’ he cried. ‘here are the very letters. but what is this written above them?’ “‘put the papers on the sundial,’ i read, peeping over his shoulder. “‘what papers? what sundial?’ he asked. “‘the sundial in the garden. there is no other,’ said i; ‘but the papers must be those that are destroyed.’ “‘pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘we are in a civilized land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. where does the thing come from?’ “‘from dundee,’ i answered, glancing at the post-mark. “‘some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘what have i to do with sundials and papers? i shall take no notice of such nonsense.’ “‘i should certainly speak to the police,’ i said. “‘and be laughed at for my pains. nothing of the sort.’ “‘then let me do so?’ “‘no, i forbid you. i won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’ “it was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. i went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings. “on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, major freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill. i was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. in that, however, i was in error. upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighborhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. i hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. he had, as it appears, been returning from fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death from accidental causes.’ carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death, i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. there were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him. “in this sinister way i came into my inheritance. you will ask me why i did not dispose of it? i answer, because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another. “it was in january, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. during that time i have lived happily at horsham, and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. i had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.” the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning to the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips. “this is the envelope,” he continued. “the post-mark is london—eastern division. within are the very words which were upon my father’s last message: ‘k. k. k.’; and then ‘put the papers on the sundial.’” “what have you done?” asked holmes. “nothing.” “nothing?” “to tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“i have felt helpless. i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.” “tut! tut!” cried sherlock holmes. “you must act, man, or you are lost. nothing but energy can save you. this is no time for despair.” “i have seen the police.” “ah!” “but they listened to my story with a smile. i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.” holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “incredible imbecility!” he cried. “they have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.” “has he come with you to-night?” “no. his orders were to stay in the house.” again holmes raved in the air. “why did you come to me?” he said; “and, above all, why did you not come at once?” “i did not know. it was only to-day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.” “it is really two days since you had the letter. we should have acted before this. you have no further evidence, i suppose, than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?” “there is one thing,” said john openshaw. he rummaged in his coat pocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. “i have some remembrance,” said he, “that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular color. i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped destruction. beyond the mention of pips, i do not see that it helps us much. i think myself that it is a page from some private diary. the writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.” holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. it was headed, “march, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical notices: “4th. hudson came. same old platform. “7th. set the pips on mccauley, paramore, and john swain, of st. augustine. “9th. mccauley cleared. “10th. john swain cleared. “12th. visited paramore. all well.” “thank you!” said holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to our visitor. “and now you must on no account lose another instant. we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. you must get home instantly and act.” “what shall i do?” “there is but one thing to do. it must be done at once. you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. do you understand?” “entirely.” “do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. i think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.” “i thank you,” said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat. “you have given me fresh life and hope. i shall certainly do as you advise.” “do not lose an instant. and, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. how do you go back?” “by train from waterloo.” “it is not yet nine. the streets will be crowded, so i trust that you may be in safety. and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.” “i am armed.” “that is well. to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case.” “i shall see you at horsham, then?” “no, your secret lies in london. it is there that i shall seek it.” “then i shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. i shall take your advice in every particular.” he shook hands with us, and took his leave. outside the wind still screamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. this strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more. sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling. “i think, watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.” “save, perhaps, the sign of four.” “well, yes. save, perhaps, that. and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos.” “but have you,” i asked, “formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?” “there can be no question as to their nature,” he answered. “then what are they? who is this k. k. k., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?” sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “the ideal reasoner,” he remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. to carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. it is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this i have endeavored in my case to do. if i remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.” “yes,” i answered, laughing. “it was a singular document. philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, i remember. botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. those, i think, were the main points of my analysis.” holmes grinned at the last item. “well,” he said, “i say now, as i said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopædia which stands upon the shelf beside you. thank you. now let us consider the situation, and see what may be deduced from it. in the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america. men at his time of life do not change all their habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town. his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of some one or something which drove him from america. as to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. did you remark the post-marks of those letters?” “the first was from pondicherry, the second from dundee, and the third from london.” “from east london. what do you deduce from that?” “they are all seaports. that the writer was on board of a ship.” “excellent. we have already a clew. there can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship. and now let us consider another point. in the case of pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in dundee it was only some three or four days. does that suggest anything?” “a greater distance to travel.” “but the letter had also a greater distance to come.” “then i do not see the point.” “there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. it looks as if they always sent their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee. if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed. i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the sailing-vessel which brought the writer.” “it is possible.” “more than that. it is probable. and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why i urged young openshaw to caution. the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. but this one comes from london, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.” “good god!” i cried; “what can it mean, this relentless persecution?” “the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s jury. there must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. in this way you see k. k. k. ceases to be the initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.” “but of what society?” “have you never—” said sherlock holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice—“have you never heard of the ku klux klan?” “i never have.” holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “here it is,” said he, presently, “‘ku klux klan. a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. this terrible secret society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in tennessee, louisiana, the carolinas, georgia, and florida. its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro voters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognized shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. if he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. so perfect was the organization of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. for some years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south. eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’ “you will observe,” said holmes, laying down the volume, “that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers. it may well have been cause and effect. it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.” “then the page we have seen—” “is such as we might expect. it ran, if i remember right, ‘sent the pips to a, b, and c,’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. then there are successive entries that a and b cleared, or left the country, and finally that c was visited, with, i fear, a sinister result for c. well, i think, doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the mean time is to do what i have told him. there is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.” * * * * * it had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down. “you will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “i have, i foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw’s.” “what steps will you take?” i asked. “it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. i may have to go down to horsham, after all.” “you will not go there first?” “no, i shall commence with the city. just ring the bell, and the maid will bring up your coffee.” as i waited, i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart. “holmes,” i cried, “you are too late.” “ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “i feared as much. how was it done?” he spoke calmly, but i could see that he was deeply moved. “my eye caught the name of openshaw, and the heading, ‘tragedy near waterloo bridge.’ here is the account: ‘between nine and ten last night police-constable cook, of the h division, on duty near waterloo bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. the night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. the alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was john openshaw, and whose residence is near horsham. it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. the body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the river-side landing-stages.’” we sat in silence for some minutes, holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him. “that hurts my pride, watson,” he said, at last. “it is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. it becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if god sends me health, i shall set my hand upon this gang. that he should come to me for help, and that i should send him away to his death—!” he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands. “they must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed, at last. “how could they have decoyed him down there? the embankment is not on the direct line to the station. the bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. well, watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. i am going out now!” [illustration: “‘holmes,’ i cried, ‘you are too late’”] “to the police?” “no; i shall be my own police. when i have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.” all day i was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street. sherlock holmes had not come back yet. it was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. he walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the loaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water. “you are hungry,” i remarked. “starving. it had escaped my memory. i have had nothing since breakfast.” “nothing?” “not a bite. i had no time to think of it.” “and how have you succeeded?” “well.” “you have a clew?” “i have them in the hollow of my hand. young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. why, watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. it is well thought of!” “what do you mean?” he took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he squeezed out the pips upon the table. of these he took five, and thrust them into an envelope. on the inside of the flap he wrote “s. h. for j. o.” then he sealed it and addressed it to “captain james calhoun, bark _lone star_, savannah, georgia.” “that will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “it may give him a sleepless night. he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him.” “and who is this captain calhoun?” “the leader of the gang. i shall have the others, but he first.” “how did you trace it, then?” he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names. “i have spent the whole day,” said he, “over lloyd’s registers and the files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in ’83. there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. of these, one, the _lone star_, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from london, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union.” “texas, i think.” “i was not and am not sure which; but i knew that the ship must have an american origin.” “what then?” “i searched the dundee records, and when i found that the bark _lone star_ was there in january, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london.” “yes?” “the _lone star_ had arrived here last week. i went down to the albert dock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to savannah. i wired to gravesend, and learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is easterly, i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins, and not very far from the isle of wight.” “what will you do, then?” “oh, i have my hand upon him. he and the two mates, are, as i learn, the only native-born americans in the ship. the others are finns and germans. i know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. by the time that their sailing-ship reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.” there is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. we waited long for news of the _lone star_ of savannah, but none ever reached us. we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “l. s.” carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _lone star_. adventure vi the man with the twisted lip isa whitney, brother of the late elias whitney, d.d., principal of the theological college of st. george’s, was much addicted to opium. the habit grew upon him, as i understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read de quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. he found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. i can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man. one night—it was in june, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. i sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment. “a patient!” said she. “you’ll have to go out.” i groaned, for i was newly come back from a weary day. we heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-colored stuff, with a black veil, entered the room. “you will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “oh, i’m in such trouble!” she cried; “i do so want a little help.” “why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is kate whitney. how you startled me, kate! i had not an idea who you were when you came in.” “i didn’t know what to do, so i came straight to you.” that was always the way. folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house. “it was very sweet of you to come. now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. or should you rather that i sent james off to bed?” “oh, no, no! i want the doctor’s advice and help, too. it’s about isa. he has not been home for two days. i am so frightened about him!” it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. did she know where her husband was? was it possible that we could bring him back to her? it seemed that it was. she had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city. hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. there he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the “bar of gold,” in upper swandam lane. but what was she to do? how could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him? there was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. might i not escort her to this place? and then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? i was isa whitney’s medical adviser, and as such i had influence over him. i could manage it better if i were alone. i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. and so in ten minutes i had left my arm-chair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be. but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge. between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, i found the den of which i was in search. ordering my cab to wait, i passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship. through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the new-comer. out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. the most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor. at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire. as i entered, a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth. “thank you. i have not come to stay,” said i. “there is a friend of mine here, mr. isa whitney, and i wish to speak with him.” there was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering through the gloom, i saw whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me. “my god! it’s watson,” said he. he was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “i say, watson, what o’clock is it?” “nearly eleven.” “of what day?” “of friday, june 19th.” “good heavens! i thought it was wednesday. it is wednesday. what d’you want to frighten a chap for?” he sank his face onto his arms, and began to sob in a high treble key. “i tell you that it is friday, man. your wife has been waiting this two days for you. you should be ashamed of yourself!” “so i am. but you’ve got mixed, watson, for i have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes—i forget how many. but i’ll go home with you. i wouldn’t frighten kate—poor little kate. give me your hand! have you a cab?” “yes, i have one waiting.” “then i shall go in it. but i must owe something. find what i owe, watson. i am all off color. i can do nothing for myself.” i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, “walk past me, and then look back at me.” the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. i glanced down. they could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. i took two steps forward and looked back. it took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. he had turned his back so that none could see him but i. his form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at my surprise, was none other than sherlock holmes. he made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility. “holmes!” i whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?” “as low as you can,” he answered; “i have excellent ears. if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.” “i have a cab outside.” “then pray send him home in it. you may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. if you will wait outside, i shall be with you in five minutes.” it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes’s requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. i felt, however, that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest, i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. in a few minutes i had written my note, paid whitney’s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes. for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter. “i suppose, watson,” said he, “that you imagine that i have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.” “i was certainly surprised to find you there.” “but not more so than i to find you.” “i came to find a friend.” “and i to find an enemy.” “an enemy?” “yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall i say, my natural prey. briefly, watson, i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and i have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as i have done before now. had i been recognized in that den my life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for i have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. there is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of paul’s wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.” “what! you do not mean bodies?” “aye, bodies, watson. we should be rich men if we had £1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. it is the vilest murder-trap on the whole river-side, and i fear that neville st. clair has entered it never to leave it more. but our trap should be here.” he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs. “now, watson,” said holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. “you’ll come with me, won’t you?” “if i can be of use.” “oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. my room at ‘the cedars’ is a double-bedded one.” “‘the cedars?’” “yes; that is mr. st. clair’s house. i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry.” “where is it, then?” “near lee, in kent. we have a seven-mile drive before us.” “but i am all in the dark.” “of course you are. you’ll know all about it presently. jump up here. all right, john; we shall not need you. here’s half a crown. look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. give her her head. so long, then!” he flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while i sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. we had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best. “you have a grand gift of silence, watson,” said he. “it makes you quite invaluable as a companion. ’pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over pleasant. i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.” “you forget that i know nothing about it.” “i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee. it seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, i can get nothing to go upon. there’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but i can’t get the end of it into my hand. now, i’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.” “proceed, then.” “some years ago—to be definite, in may, 1884—there came to lee a gentleman, neville st. clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. he took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. by degrees he made friends in the neighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. he had no occupation, but was interested in several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5.14 from cannon street every night. mr. st. clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. i may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10_s._, while he has £220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank. there is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind. “last monday mr. neville st. clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company. now, if you are well up in your london, you will know that the offices of the company is in fresno street, which branches out of upper swandam lane, where you found me to-night. mrs. st. clair had her lunch, started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station. have you followed me so far?” “it is very clear.” “if you remember, monday was an exceedingly hot day, and mrs. st. clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself. while she was walking in this way down swandam lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. the window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. he waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie. [illustration: “at the foot of the stairs she met this lascar scoundrel.”] “convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and, running through the front room, she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. at the foot of the stairs, however, she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken, who thrust her back, and, aided by a dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in fresno street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. the inspector and two men accompanied her back, and, in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which mr. st. clair had last been seen. there was no sign of him there. in fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that mrs. st. clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid from it. out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. it was the toy which he had promised to bring home. “this discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realize that the matter was serious. the rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. the bedroom window was a broad one, and opened from below. on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the window-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr. neville st. clair, with the exception of his coat. his boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of mr. neville st. clair. out of the window he must apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy. “and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by mrs. st. clair’s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. his defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman’s clothes. “so much for the lascar manager. now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st. clair. his name is hugh boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city. he is a professional beggar, though, in order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. some little distance down threadneedle street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is a piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. i have watched the fellow more than once, before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance, and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. his appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. a shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.” “but a cripple!” said i. “what could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?” “he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. surely your medical experience would tell you, watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.” “pray continue your narrative.” “mrs. st. clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. inspector barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. there were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. he denied strenuously having ever seen mr. neville st. clair, and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. as to mrs. st. clair’s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. he was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clew. “and it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. it was neville st. clair’s coat, and not neville st. clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. and what do you think they found in the pockets?” “i cannot imagine.” “no, i don’t think you would guess. every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. but a human body is a different matter. there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.” “but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. would the body be dressed in a coat alone?” “no, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st. clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. what would he do then? it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. he would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. he has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. there is not an instant to be lost. he rushes to some secret horde, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat’s sinking. he throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.” “it certainly sounds feasible.” “well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. boone, as i have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. he had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. there the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what neville st. clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.” while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows. “we are on the outskirts of lee,” said my companion. “we have touched on three english counties in our short drive, starting in middlesex, passing over an angle of surrey, and ending in kent. see that light among the trees? that is ‘the cedars,’ and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, i have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse’s feet.” “but why are you not conducting the case from baker street?” i asked. “because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. mrs. st. clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. i hate to meet her, watson, when i have no news of her husband. here we are. whoa, there, whoa!” we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. a stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and, springing down, i followed holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. as we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question. “well?” she cried, “well?” and then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. “no good news?” “none.” “no bad?” “no.” “thank god for that. but come in. you must be weary, for you have had a long day.” “this is my friend, dr. watson. he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.” “i am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “you will, i am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.” “my dear madam,” said i, “i am an old campaigner, and if i were not, i can very well see that no apology is needed. if i can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, i shall be indeed happy.” “now, mr. sherlock holmes,” said the lady, as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, “i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which i beg that you will give a plain answer.” “certainly, madam.” “do not trouble about my feelings. i am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. i simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.” “upon what point?” “in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive?” sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “frankly, now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair. “frankly, then, madam, i do not.” “you think that he is dead?” “i do.” “murdered?” “i don’t say that. perhaps.” “and on what day did he meet his death?” “on monday.” “then perhaps, mr. holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to-day.” sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized. “what!” he roared. “yes, to-day.” she stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air. “may i see it?” “certainly.” he snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. i had left my chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. the envelope was a very coarse one, and was stamped with the gravesend post-mark, and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight. “coarse writing,” murmured holmes. “surely this is not your husband’s writing, madam.” “no, but the enclosure is.” “i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.” “how can you tell that?” “the name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. the rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. if it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. this man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. it is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. let us now see the letter. ha! there has been an enclosure here!” “yes, there was a ring. his signet-ring.” “and you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?” “one of his hands.” “one?” “his hand when he wrote hurriedly. it is very unlike his usual writing, and yet i know it well.” “‘dearest do not be frightened. all will come well. there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. wait in patience.—neville.’ written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. hum! posted to-day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. ha! and the flap has been gummed, if i am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. and you have no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?” “none. neville wrote those words.” “and they were posted to-day at gravesend. well, mrs. st. clair, the clouds lighten, though i should not venture to say that the danger is over.” “but he must be alive, mr. holmes.” “unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. the ring, after all, proves nothing. it may have been taken from him.” “no, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!” “very well. it may, however, have been written on monday, and only posted to-day.” “that is possible.” “if so, much may have happened between.” “oh, you must not discourage me, mr. holmes. i know that all is well with him. there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him. on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet i in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. do you think that i would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his death?” “i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. but if your husband is alive, and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?” “i cannot imagine. it is unthinkable.” “and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?” “no.” “and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?” “very much so.” “was the window open?” “yes.” “then he might have called to you?” “he might.” “he only, as i understand, gave an inarticulate cry?” “yes.” “a call for help, you thought?” “yes. he waved his hands.” “but it might have been a cry of surprise. astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?” “it is possible.” “and you thought he was pulled back?” “he disappeared so suddenly.” “he might have leaped back. you did not see any one else in the room?” “no, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs.” “quite so. your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?” “but without his collar or tie. i distinctly saw his bare throat.” “had he ever spoken of swandam lane?” “never.” “had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?” “never.” “thank you, mrs. st. clair. those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear. we shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.” a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and i was quickly between the sheets, for i was weary after my night of adventure. sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed it, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. he took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and arm-chairs. with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. so he sat as i dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment. the pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night. “awake, watson?” he asked. “yes.” “game for a morning drive?” “certainly.” “then dress. no one is stirring yet, but i know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” he chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night. as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was stirring. it was twenty-five minutes past four. i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse. “i want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “i think, watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe. i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross. but i think i have the key of the affair now.” “and where is it?” i asked, smiling. “in the bath-room,” he answered. “oh yes, i am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “i have just been there, and i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.” we made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. we both sprang in, and away we dashed down the london road. a few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream. “it has been in some points a singular case,” said holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. “i confess that i have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.” in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side. passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river, and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right, and found ourselves in bow street. sherlock holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. one of them held the horse’s head while the other led us in. “who is on duty?” asked holmes. “inspector bradstreet, sir.” “ah, bradstreet, how are you?” a tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “i wish to have a quiet word with you, bradstreet.” “certainly, mr. holmes. step into my room here.” it was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. the inspector sat down at his desk. “what can i do for you, mr. holmes?” “i called about that beggarman, boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. clair, of lee.” “yes. he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.” “so i heard. you have him here?” “in the cells.” “is he quiet?” “oh, he gives no trouble. but he is a dirty scoundrel.” “dirty?” “yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s. well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and i think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.” “i should like to see him very much.” “would you? that is easily done. come this way. you can leave your bag.” “no, i think that i’ll take it.” “very good. come this way, if you please.” he led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side. “the third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “here it is!” he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through. “he is asleep,” said he. “you can see him very well.” we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. he was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. he was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead. “he’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector. “he certainly needs a wash,” remarked holmes. “i had an idea that he might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge. “he! he! you are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector. “now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.” “well, i don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “he doesn’t look a credit to the bow street cells, does he?” he slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face. “let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to mr. neville st. clair, of lee, in the county of kent.” never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man’s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the coarse brown tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! a twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a scream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow. “great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man. i know him from the photograph.” the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. “be it so,” said he. “and pray, what am i charged with?” “with making away with mr. neville st.—— oh, come, you can’t be charged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the inspector, with a grin. “well, i have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.” “if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, i am illegally detained.” “no crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said holmes. “you would have done better to have trusted your wife.” “it was not the wife, it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “god help me, i would not have them ashamed of their father. my god! what an exposure! what can i do?” sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder. “if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he, “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. on the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. inspector bradstreet would, i am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the proper authorities. the case would then never go into court at all.” “god bless you!” cried the prisoner, passionately. “i would have endured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children. “you are the first who have ever heard my story. my father was a school-master in chesterfield, where i received an excellent education. i travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london. one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and i volunteered to supply them. there was the point from which all my adventures started. it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles. when an actor i had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill. i took advantage now of my attainments. i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the busiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a beggar. for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned home in the evening i found, to my surprise, that i had received no less than 26_s._ 4_d._ “i wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, i backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon me for £25. i was at my wits’ end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. i begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise. in ten days i had the money, and had paid the debt. “well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £2 a week, when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. it was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting, and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. only one man knew my secret. he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar, and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. this fellow, a lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession. “well, very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money. i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn £700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized character in the city. all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take £2. “as i grew richer i grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my real occupation. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she little knew what. “last monday i had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room above the opium den, when i looked out of my window, and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. i gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the lascar, entreated him to prevent any one from coming up to me. i heard her voice down-stairs, but i knew that she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. then i seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings. i hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the thames. the other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after i found, rather, i confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as mr. neville st. clair, i was arrested as his murderer. “i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, i slipped off my ring, and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.” “that note only reached her yesterday,” said holmes. “good god! what a week she must have spent!” “the police have watched this lascar,” said inspector bradstreet, “and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.” “that was it,” said holmes, nodding approvingly; “i have no doubt of it. but have you never been prosecuted for begging?” “many times; but what was a fine to me?” “it must stop here, however,” said bradstreet. “if the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of hugh boone.” “i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.” “in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. but if you are found again, then all must come out. i am sure, mr. holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. i wish i knew how you reach your results.” “i reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. i think, watson, that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast.” adventure vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination. “you are engaged,” said i; “perhaps i interrupt you.” “not at all. i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results. the matter is a perfectly trivial one” (he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat), “but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.” i seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. “i suppose,” i remarked, “that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.” “no, no. no crime,” said sherlock holmes, laughing. “only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. we have already had experience of such.” “so much so,” i remarked, “that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.” “precisely. you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers, to the singular case of miss mary sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. well, i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. you know peterson, the commissionaire?” “yes.” “it is to him that this trophy belongs.” “it is his hat.” “no, no; he found it. its owner is unknown. i beg that you will look upon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem. and, first, as to how it came here. it arrived upon christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, i have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of peterson’s fire. the facts are these: about four o’clock on christmas morning, peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road. in front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. as he reached the corner of goodge street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. one of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road. the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose.” “which surely he restored to their owner?” “my dear fellow, there lies the problem. it is true that ‘for mrs. henry baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘h. b.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of bakers, and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.” “what, then, did peterson do?” “he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. the goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner.” “did he not advertise?” “no.” “then, what clue could you have as to his identity?” “only as much as we can deduce.” “from his hat?” “precisely.” “but you are joking. what can you gather from this old battered felt?” “here is my lens. you know my methods. what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?” i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard, and much the worse for wear. the lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discolored. there was no maker’s name; but, as holmes had remarked, the initials “h. b.” were scrawled upon one side. it was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. for the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discolored patches by smearing them with ink. “i can see nothing,” said i, handing it back to my friend. “on the contrary, watson, you can see everything. you fail, however, to reason from what you see. you are too timid in drawing your inferences.” “then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?” he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. “it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. he had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.” “my dear holmes!” “he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. “he is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. also, by-the-way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.” “you are certainly joking, holmes.” “not in the least. is it possible that even now, when i give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?” “i have no doubt that i am very stupid; but i must confess that i am unable to follow you. for example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?” for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head. it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “it is a question of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have something in it.” “the decline of his fortunes, then?” “this hat is three years old. these flat brims curled at the edge came in then. it is a hat of the very best quality. look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.” “well, that is clear enough, certainly. but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?” sherlock holmes laughed. “here is the foresight,” said he, putting his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. “they are never sold upon hats. if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. but since we see that he has broken the elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. on the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.” “your reasoning is certainly plausible.” “the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. the lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. they all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odor of lime-cream. this dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time; while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the best of training.” “but his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.” “this hat has not been brushed for weeks. when i see you, my dear watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.” “but he might be a bachelor.” “nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. remember the card upon the bird’s leg.” “you have an answer to everything. but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?” “one tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when i see no less than five, i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. are you satisfied?” “well, it is very ingenious,” said i, laughing; “but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.” sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment. “the goose, mr. holmes! the goose, sir!” he gasped. “eh? what of it, then? has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?” holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man’s excited face. “see here, sir! see what my wife found in its crop!” he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand. sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle. “by jove, peterson!” said he, “this is treasure trove indeed. i suppose you know what you have got?” “a diamond, sir? a precious stone. it cuts into glass as though it were putty.” “it’s more than a precious stone. it is _the_ precious stone.” “not the countess of morcar’s blue carbuncle!” i ejaculated. “precisely so. i ought to know its size and shape, seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in _the times_ every day lately. it is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of £1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.” “a thousand pounds! great lord of mercy!” the commissionaire plumped down into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us. “that is the reward, and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.” “it was lost, if i remember aright, at the ‘hotel cosmopolitan,’” i remarked. “precisely so, on december 22d, just five days ago. john horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s jewel-case. the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes. i have some account of the matter here, i believe.” he rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph: “‘hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery. john horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst. abstracted from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. james ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. he had remained with horner some little time, but had finally been called away. on returning, he found that horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. ryder instantly gave the alarm, and horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. catherine cusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard ryder’s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. inspector bradstreet, b division, gave evidence as to the arrest of horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the assizes. horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion, and was carried out of court.’ “hum! so much for the police-court,” said holmes, thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. “the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other. you see, watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from mr. henry baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you. so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. to do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. if this fails, i shall have recourse to other methods.” “what will you say?” “give me a pencil and that slip of paper. now, then: ‘found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat. mr. henry baker can have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221b, baker street.’ that is clear and concise.” “very. but will he see it?” “well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson, that he thought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one who knows him will direct his attention to it. here you are, peterson, run down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening papers.” “in which, sir?” “oh, in the _globe_, _star_, _pall mall_, _st. james’s_, _evening news_, _standard_, _echo_, and any others that occur to you.” “very well, sir. and this stone?” “ah, yes, i shall keep the stone. thank you. and, i say, peterson, just buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.” when the commissionaire had gone, holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. “it’s a bonny thing,” said he. “just see how it glints and sparkles. of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. every good stone is. they are the devil’s pet baits. in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. this stone is not yet twenty years old. it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. in spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal. who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? i’ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it.” “do you think that this man horner is innocent?” “i cannot tell.” “well, then, do you imagine that this other one, henry baker, had anything to do with the matter?” “it is, i think, much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. that, however, i shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer to our advertisement.” “and you can do nothing until then?” “nothing.” “in that case i shall continue my professional round. but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.” “very glad to see you. i dine at seven. there is a woodcock, i believe. by-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps i ought to ask mrs. hudson to examine its crop.” i had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when i found myself in baker street once more. as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. just as i arrived, the door was opened, and we were shown up together to holmes’s room. “mr. henry baker, i believe,” said he, rising from his arm-chair, and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. “pray take this chair by the fire, mr. baker. it is a cold night, and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. ah, watson, you have just come at the right time. is that your hat, mr. baker?” “yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.” he was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. a touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled holmes’s surmise as to his habits. his rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. he spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune. “we have retained these things for some days,” said holmes, “because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.” our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.” “very naturally. by-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.” “to eat it!” our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement. “yes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?” “oh, certainly, certainly;” answered mr. baker, with a sigh of relief. “of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish—” the man burst into a hearty laugh. “they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that i can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. no, sir, i think that, with your permission, i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard.” sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “there is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “by-the-way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown goose.” “certainly, sir,” said baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained property under his arm. “there are a few of us who frequent the ‘alpha inn,’ near the museum—we are to be found in the museum itself during the day, you understand. this year our good host, windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at christmas. my pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. i am much indebted to you, sir, for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.” with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way. “so much for mr. henry baker,” said holmes, when he had closed the door behind him. “it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. are you hungry, watson?” “not particularly.” “then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up this clew while it is still hot.” “by all means.” it was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors’ quarter, wimpole street, harley street, and so through wigmore street into oxford street. in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the “alpha inn,” which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn. holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord. “your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he. “my geese!” the man seemed surprised. “yes. i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr. henry baker, who was a member of your goose club.” “ah! yes, i see. but you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.” “indeed! whose, then?” “well, i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden.” “indeed? i know some of them. which was it?” “breckinridge is his name.” “ah! i don’t know him. well, here’s your good health, landlord, and prosperity to your house. good-night?” “now for mr. breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we came out into the frosty air. “remember, watson, that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. let us follow it out to the bitter end. faces to the south, then, and quick march!” we passed across holborn, down endell street, and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market. one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up the shutters. “good-evening. it’s a cold night,” said holmes. the salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion. “sold out of geese, i see,” continued holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble. “let you have 500 to-morrow morning.” “that’s no good.” “well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.” “ah, but i was recommended to you.” “who by?” “the landlord of the ‘alpha.’” “oh, yes; i sent him a couple of dozen.” “fine birds they were, too. now where did you get them from?” to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman. “now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, “what are you driving at? let’s have it straight, now.” “it is straight enough. i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the ‘alpha.’” “well, then, i sha’n’t tell you. so now!” “oh, it is a matter of no importance; but i don’t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.” “warm! you’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as i am. when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it’s ‘where are the geese?’ and ‘who did you sell the geese to?’ and ‘what will you take for the geese?’ one would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.” “well, i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,” said holmes, carelessly. “if you won’t tell us the bet is off, that is all. but i’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred.” “well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the salesman. “it’s nothing of the kind.” “i say it is.” “i don’t believe it.” “d’you think you know more about fowls than i, who have handled them ever since i was a nipper? i tell you, all those birds that went to the ‘alpha’ were town bred.” “you’ll never persuade me to believe that.” “will you bet, then?” “it’s merely taking your money, for i know that i am right. but i’ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.” the salesman chuckled grimly. “bring me the books, bill,” said he. the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp. “now then, mr. cocksure,” said the salesman, “i thought that i was out of geese, but before i finish you’ll find that there is still one left in my shop. you see this little book?” “well?” “that’s the list of the folk from whom i buy. d’you see? well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. now, then! you see this other page in red ink? well, that is a list of my town suppliers. now, look at that third name. just read it out to me.” “mrs. oakshott, 117, brixton road—249,” read holmes. “quite so. now turn that up in the ledger.” holmes turned to the page indicated. “here you are, ‘mrs. oakshott, 117, brixton road, egg and poultry supplier.’” “now, then, what’s the last entry?” “‘december 22. twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._’” “quite so. there you are. and underneath?” “‘sold to mr. windigate of the ‘alpha,’ at 12_s._’” “what have you to say now?” sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined. he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. a few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him. “when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘pink ‘un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said he. “i dare say that if i had put £100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. well, watson, we are, i fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs. oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and i should—” his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while breckinridge the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure. “i’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “i wish you were all at the devil together. if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk i’ll set the dog at you. you bring mrs. oakshott here and i’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? did i buy the geese off you?” “no; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man. “well, then, ask mrs. oakshott for it.” “she told me to ask you.” “well, you can ask the king of proosia, for all i care. i’ve had enough of it. get out of this!” he rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness. “ha! this may save us a visit to brixton road,” whispered holmes. “come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. he sprang round, and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of color had been driven from his face. “who are you, then? what do you want?” he asked, in a quavering voice. “you will excuse me,” said holmes, blandly, “but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. i think that i could be of assistance to you.” “you? who are you? how could you know anything of the matter?” “my name is sherlock holmes. it is my business to know what other people don’t know.” “but you can know nothing of this?” “excuse me, i know everything of it. you are endeavoring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to a salesman named breckinridge, by him in turn to mr. windigate, of the ‘alpha,’ and by him to his club, of which mr. henry baker is a member.” “oh, sir, you are the very man whom i have longed to meet,” cried the little fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter.” sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “in that case we had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept market-place,” said he. “but pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting.” the man hesitated for an instant. “my name is john robinson,” he answered, with a sidelong glance. “no, no; the real name,” said holmes, sweetly. “it is always awkward doing business with an _alias_.” a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “well, then,” said he, “my real name is james ryder.” “precisely so. head attendant at the ‘hotel cosmopolitan.’ pray step into the cab, and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.” the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at baker street. nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him. “here we are!” said holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. “the fire looks very seasonable in this weather. you look cold, mr. ryder. pray take the basket-chair. i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. now, then! you want to know what became of those geese?” “yes, sir.” “or rather, i fancy, of that goose. it was one bird, i imagine, in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.” ryder quivered with emotion. “oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me where it went to?” “it came here.” “here?” “yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. i don’t wonder that you should take an interest in it. it laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. i have it here in my museum.” our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with his right hand. holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it. “the game’s up, ryder,” said holmes, quietly. “hold up, man, or you’ll be into the fire! give him an arm back into his chair, watson. he’s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. give him a dash of brandy. so! now he looks a little more human. what a shrimp it is, to be sure!” for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser. “i have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which i could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. you had heard, ryder, of this blue stone of the countess of morcar’s?” “it was catherine cusack who told me of it,” said he, in a crackling voice. “i see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. it seems to me, ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. you knew that this man horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. what did you do, then? you made some small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for. then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. you then—” ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion’s knees. “for god’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “think of my father! of my mother! it would break their hearts. i never went wrong before! i never will again. i swear it. i’ll swear it on a bible. oh, don’t bring it into court! for christ’s sake, don’t!” “get back into your chair!” said holmes, sternly. “it is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.” “i will fly, mr. holmes. i will leave the country, sir. then the charge against him will break down.” “hum! we will talk about that. and now let us hear a true account of the next act. how came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.” [illustration: “‘have mercy!’ he shrieked”] ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “i will tell you it just as it happened, sir,” said he. “when horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. i went out, as if on some commission, and i made for my sister’s house. she had married a man named oakshott, and lived in brixton road, where she fattened fowls for the market. all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road. my sister asked me what was the matter, and why i was so pale; but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do. “i had a friend once called maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in pentonville. one day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. i knew that he would be true to me, for i knew one or two things about him; so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. he would show me how to turn the stone into money. but how to get to him in safety? i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel. i might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. i was leaning against the wall at the time, and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived. “my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present, and i knew that she was always as good as her word. i would take my goose now, and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn. there was a little shed in the yard, and behind this i drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. i caught it, and, prying its bill open, i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. the bird gave a gulp, and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. but the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others. “‘whatever were you doing with that bird, jem?’ says she. “‘well,’ said i, ‘you said you’d give me one for christmas, and i was feeling which was the fattest.’ “‘oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—jem’s bird, we call it. it’s the big white one over yonder. there’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’ “‘thank you, maggie,’ says i; ‘but if it is all the same to you, i’d rather have that one i was handling just now.’ “‘the other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened it expressly for you.’ “‘never mind. i’ll have the other, and i’ll take it now,’ said i. “‘oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘which is it you want, then?’ “‘that white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.’ “‘oh, very well. kill it and take it with you.’ “well, i did what she said, mr. holmes, and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn. i told my pal what i had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. he laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. my heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. i left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried into the back yard. there was not a bird to be seen there. “‘where are they all, maggie?’ i cried. “‘gone to the dealer’s, jem.’ “‘which dealer’s?’ “‘breckinridge, of covent garden.’ “‘but was there another with a barred tail?’ i asked, ‘the same as the one i chose?’ “‘yes, jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and i could never tell them apart.’ “well, then, of course i saw it all, and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. you heard him yourselves to-night. well, he has always answered me like that. my sister thinks that i am going mad. sometimes i think that i am myself. and now—and now i am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character. god help me! god help me!” he burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands. there was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes’s finger-tips upon the edge of the table. then my friend rose and threw open the door. “get out!” said he. “what, sir! oh, heaven bless you!” “no more words. get out!” and no more words were needed. there was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street. “after all, watson,” said holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, “i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. if horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. i suppose that i am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that i am saving a soul. this fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. besides, it is the season of forgiveness. chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. if you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also, a bird will be the chief feature.” adventure viii the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes, i find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. of all these varied cases, however, i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran. the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street. it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for i have reasons to know that there are wide-spread rumors as to the death of dr. grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth. it was early in april in the year ’83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. he was a late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven, i blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for i was myself regular in my habits. “very sorry to knock you up, watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot this morning. mrs. hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and i on you.” “what is it, then—a fire?” “no; a client. it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. she is waiting now in the sitting-room. now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, i am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. i thought, at any rate, that i should call you and give you the chance.” “my dear fellow, i would not miss it for anything.” i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. i rapidly threw on my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered. “good-morning, madam,” said holmes, cheerily. “my name is sherlock holmes. this is my intimate friend and associate, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. ha! i am glad to see that mrs. hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. pray draw up to it, and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for i observe that you are shivering.” “it is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman, in a low voice, changing her seat as requested. “what, then?” “it is fear, mr. holmes. it is terror.” she raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her expression was weary and haggard. sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances. “you must not fear,” said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. “we shall soon set matters right, i have no doubt. you have come in by train this morning, i see.” “you know me, then?” “no, but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. you must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.” the lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my companion. “there is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. the marks are perfectly fresh. there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.” “whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “i started from home before six, reached leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to waterloo. sir, i can stand this strain no longer; i shall go mad if it continues. i have no one to turn to—none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. i have heard of you, mr. holmes; i have heard of you from mrs. farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. it was from her that i had your address. oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks i shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.” holmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted. “farintosh,” said he. “ah yes, i recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. i think it was before your time, watson. i can only say, madam, that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend. as to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to, at the time which suits you best. and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.” “alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. he does not say so, but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. but i have heard, mr. holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.” “i am all attention, madam.” “my name is helen stoner, and i am living with my step-father, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england, the roylotts of stoke moran, on the western border of surrey.” holmes nodded his head. “the name is familiar to me,” said he. “the family was at one time among the richest in england, and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north, and hampshire in the west. in the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency. nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. the last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my step-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree, and went out to calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. in a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. as it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man. “when dr. roylott was in india he married my mother, mrs. stoner, the young widow of major-general stoner, of the bengal artillery. my sister julia and i were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother’s re-marriage. she had a considerable sum of money—not less than £1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to dr. roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. shortly after our return to england my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe. dr. roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london, and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran. the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness. “but a terrible change came over our step-father about this time. instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, i believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. a series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. “last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure. he had no friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. he has a passion also for indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master. “you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives. no servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. she was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.” “your sister is dead, then?” “she died just two years ago, and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you. you can understand that, living the life which i have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. we had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, miss honoria westphail, who lives near harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. julia went there at christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. my step-father learned of the engagement when my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.” sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor. “pray be precise as to details,” said he. “it is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. the manor-house is, as i have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. of these bedrooms the first is dr. roylott’s, the second my sister’s, and the third my own. there is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. do i make myself plain?” “perfectly so.” “the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. that fatal night dr. roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. she left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. at eleven o’clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back. “‘tell me, helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard any one whistle in the dead of the night?’ “‘never,’ said i. “‘i suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?’ “‘certainly not. but why?’ “‘because during the last few nights i have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. i am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. i cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it.’ “‘no, i have not. it must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’ “‘very likely. and yet if it were on the lawn, i wonder that you did not hear it also.’ “‘ah, but i sleep more heavily than you.’ “‘well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ she smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock.” “indeed,” said holmes. “was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?” “always.” “and why?” “i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.” “quite so. pray proceed with your statement.” “i could not sleep that night. a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. my sister and i, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. it was a wild night. the wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. i knew that it was my sister’s voice. i sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. as i ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. i stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. by the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. i ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. she writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. at first i thought that she had not recognized me, but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget, ‘oh, my god! helen! it was the band! the speckled band!’ there was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. i rushed out, calling loudly for my step-father, and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. when he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.” “one moment,” said holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? could you swear to it?” “that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. it is my strong impression that i heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, i may possibly have been deceived.” “was your sister dressed?” “no, she was in her night-dress. in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.” “showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. that is important. and what conclusions did the coroner come to?” “he investigated the case with great care, for dr. roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. the walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. the chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. it is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.” “how about poison?” “the doctors examined her for it, but without success.” “what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?” “it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine.” “were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?” “yes, there are nearly always some there.” “ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?” “sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gypsies in the plantation. i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.” holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied. “these are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.” “two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. a month ago, however, a dear friend, whom i have known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage. his name is armitage—percy armitage—the second son of mr. armitage, of crane water, near reading. my step-father has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as i lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. i sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. i was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so i dressed, and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down, got a dog-cart at the ‘crown inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to leatherhead, from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.” “you have done wisely,” said my friend. “but have you told me all?” “yes, all.” “miss roylott, you have not. you are screening your step-father.” “why, what do you mean?” for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist. “you have been cruelly used,” said holmes. the lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “he is a hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.” there was a long silence, during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire. “this is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action. yet we have not a moment to lose. if we were to come to stoke moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your step-father?” “as it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. it is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. we have a house-keeper now, but she is old and foolish, and i could easily get her out of the way.” “excellent. you are not averse to this trip, watson?” “by no means.” “then we shall both come. what are you going to do yourself?” “i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town. but i shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.” “and you may expect us early in the afternoon. i have myself some small business matters to attend to. will you not wait and breakfast?” “no, i must go. my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you. i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.” she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room. “and what do you think of it all, watson?” asked sherlock holmes, leaning back in his chair. “it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.” “dark enough and sinister enough.” “yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.” “what becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?” “i cannot think.” “when you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars which secured the shutters falling back into their place, i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.” “but what, then, did the gypsies do?” “i cannot imagine.” “i see many objections to any such theory.” “and so do i. it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day. i want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. but what in the name of the devil!” the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. a large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey. “which of you is holmes?” asked this apparition. “my name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion, quietly. “i am dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran.” “indeed, doctor,” said holmes, blandly. “pray take a seat.” “i will do nothing of the kind. my step-daughter has been here. i have traced her. what has she been saying to you?” “it is a little cold for the time of the year,” said holmes. “what has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man, furiously. “but i have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my companion, imperturbably. “ha! you put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “i know you, you scoundrel! i have heard of you before. you are holmes, the meddler.” my friend smiled. “holmes, the busybody!” his smile broadened. “holmes, the scotland-yard jack-in-office!” holmes chuckled heartily. “your conversation is most entertaining,” said he. “when you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.” “i will go when i have said my say. don’t you dare to meddle with my affairs. i know that miss stoner has been here. i traced her! i am a dangerous man to fall foul of! see here.” he stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands. “see that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room. “he seems a very amiable person,” said holmes, laughing. “i am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.” as he spoke he picked up the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again. “fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! this incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. and now, watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors’ commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.” * * * * * it was nearly one o’clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion. he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures. “i have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. the total income, which at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. each daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. it is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. my morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. and now, watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo. i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. an eley’s no. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. that and a tooth-brush are, i think, all that we need.” at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes. it was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. the trees and way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. my companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows. “look there!” said he. a heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. from amid the branches there jutted out the gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion. “stoke moran?” said he. “yes, sir, that be the house of dr. grimesby roylott,” remarked the driver. “there is some building going on there,” said holmes; “that is where we are going.” “there’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. there it is, where the lady is walking.” “and the lady, i fancy, is miss stoner,” observed holmes, shading his eyes. “yes, i think we had better do as you suggest.” we got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead. “i thought it as well,” said holmes, as we climbed the stile, “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. it may stop his gossip. good-afternoon, miss stoner. you see that we have been as good as our word.” our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. “i have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “all has turned out splendidly. dr. roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.” “we have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened. “good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.” “so it appears.” “he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him. what will he say when he returns?” “he must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more cunning than himself upon his track. you must lock yourself up from him to-night. if he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at harrow. now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.” the building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. in one of these wings the windows were broken, and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. the central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows. “this, i take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to dr. roylott’s chamber?” “exactly so. but i am now sleeping in the middle one.” “pending the alterations, as i understand. by-the-way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.” “there were none. i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.” “ah! that is suggestive. now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. there are windows in it, of course?” “yes, but very small ones. too narrow for any one to pass through.” “as you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters.” miss stoner did so, and holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “hum!” said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly presents some difficulties. no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.” a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which miss stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. it was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. these articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room, save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre. the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment. “where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow. “it goes to the house-keeper’s room.” “it looks newer than the other things?” “yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.” “your sister asked for it, i suppose?” “no, i never heard of her using it. we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.” “indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor.” he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand, and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. finally he walked over to the bed, and spent some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the wall. finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug. “why, it’s a dummy,” said he. “won’t it ring?” “no, it is not even attached to a wire. this is very interesting. you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.” “how very absurd! i never noticed that before.” “very strange!” muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. “there are one or two very singular points about this room. for example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!” “that is also quite modern,” said the lady. “done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked holmes. “yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.” “they seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. with your permission, miss stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.” dr. grimesby roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. a camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest. “what’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe. “my step-father’s business papers.” “oh! you have seen inside, then?” “only once, some years ago. i remember that it was full of papers.” “there isn’t a cat in it, for example?” “no. what a strange idea!” “well, look at this!” he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it. “no; we don’t keep a cat. but there is a cheetah and a baboon.” “ah, yes, of course! well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, i dare say. there is one point which i should wish to determine.” he squatted down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention. “thank you. that is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. “hello! here is something interesting!” the object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one corner of the bed. the lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied so as to make a loop of whip-cord. “what do you make of that, watson?” “it’s a common enough lash. but i don’t know why it should be tied.” “that is not quite so common, is it? ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. i think that i have seen enough now, miss stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.” i had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. we had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie. “it is very essential, miss stoner,” said he, “that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.” “i shall most certainly do so.” “the matter is too serious for any hesitation. your life may depend upon your compliance.” “i assure you that i am in your hands.” “in the first place, both my friend and i must spend the night in your room.” both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment. “yes, it must be so. let me explain. i believe that that is the village inn over there?” “yes, that is the ‘crown.’” “very good. your windows would be visible from there?” “certainly.” “you must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your step-father comes back. then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. i have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.” “oh yes, easily.” “the rest you will leave in our hands.” “but what will you do?” “we shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.” “i believe, mr. holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said miss stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve. “perhaps i have.” “then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.” “i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak.” “you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.” [illustration: “‘good-bye, and be brave’”] “no, i do not think so. i think that there was probably some more tangible cause. and now, miss stoner, we must leave you, for if dr. roylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what i have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.” sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the “crown inn.” they were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house. at dusk we saw dr. grimesby roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. the trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms. “do you know, watson,” said holmes, as we sat together in the gathering darkness, “i have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. there is a distinct element of danger.” “can i be of assistance?” “your presence might be invaluable.” “then i shall certainly come.” “it is very kind of you.” “you speak of danger. you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.” “no, but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more. i imagine that you saw all that i did.” “i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine.” “you saw the ventilator, too?” “yes, but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.” “i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran.” “my dear holmes!” “oh yes, i did. you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr. roylott’s cigar. now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. it could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s inquiry. i deduced a ventilator.” “but what harm can there be in that?” “well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. a ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. does not that strike you?” “i cannot as yet see any connection.” “did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?” “no.” “it was clamped to the floor. did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?” “i cannot say that i have.” “the lady could not move her bed. it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.” “holmes,” i cried, “i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.” “subtle enough and horrible enough. when a doctor does go wrong, he is the first of criminals. he has nerve and he has knowledge. palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession. this man strikes even deeper, but i think, watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.” * * * * * about nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the manor house. two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us. “that is our signal,” said holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes from the middle window.” as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. a moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand. there was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness. “my god!” i whispered; “did you see it?” holmes was for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. then he broke into a low laugh, and put his lips to my ear. “it is a nice household,” he murmured. “that is the baboon.” i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. there was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. i confess that i felt easier in my mind when, after following holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, i found myself inside the bedroom. my companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. all was as we had seen it in the daytime. then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words: “the least sound would be fatal to our plans.” i nodded to show that i had heard. “we must sit without light. he would see it through the ventilator.” i nodded again. “do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. have your pistol ready in case we should need it. i will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.” i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table. holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness. how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil? i could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet i knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself. the shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness. from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. how long they seemed, those quarters! twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall. suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. some one in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. i heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. for half an hour i sat with straining ears. then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. the instant that we heard it, holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull. “you see it, watson?” he yelled. “you see it?” but i saw nothing. at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. i could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and filled with horror and loathing. he had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened. it swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. they say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. it struck cold to our hearts, and i stood gazing at holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose. “what can it mean?” i gasped. “it means that it is all over,” holmes answered. “and perhaps, after all, it is for the best. take your pistol, and we will enter dr. roylott’s room.” with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. then he turned the handle and entered, i at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand. it was a singular sight which met our eyes. on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat dr. grimesby roylott, clad in a long gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers. across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. as we entered he made neither sound nor motion. “the band! the speckled band!” whispered holmes. i took a step forward. in an instant his strange head-gear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent. “it is a swamp adder!” cried holmes; “the deadliest snake in india. he has died within ten seconds of being bitten. violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter, and let the county police know what has happened.” as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid perch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it. * * * * * such are the true facts of the death of dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran. it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day. “i had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which shows, my dear watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. the presence of the gypsies, and the use of the word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. my attention was speedily drawn, as i have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. the discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming to the bed. the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india, i felt that i was probably on the right track. the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training. the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. it would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. then i thought of the whistle. of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. he had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. it might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim. “i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room. an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. the sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. having once made up my mind, you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof. i heard the creature hiss, as i have no doubt that you did also, and i instantly lit the light and attacked it.” “with the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr. grimesby roylott’s death, and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.” adventure ix the adventure of the engineer’s thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr. sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice—that of mr. hatherley’s thumb, and that of colonel warburton’s madness. of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. the story has, i believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect. it was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which i am now about to summarize. i had returned to civil practice, and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms, although i continually visited him, and occasionally even persuaded him to forego his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. my practice had steadily increased, and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station, i got a few patients from among the officials. one of these, whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and of endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence. one morning, at a little before seven o’clock, i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come from paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. i dressed hurriedly, for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened down-stairs. as i descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him. “i’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; “he’s all right.” “what is it, then?” i asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room. “it’s a new patient,” he whispered. “i thought i’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away. there he is, all safe and sound. i must go now, doctor; i have my dooties, just the same as you.” and off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him. i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft cloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with blood-stains. he was young, not more than five-and-twenty, i should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control. “i am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,” said he, “but i have had a very serious accident during the night. i came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. i gave the maid a card, but i see that she has left it upon the side-table.” i took it up and glanced at it. “mr. victor hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16a, victoria street (3d floor).” that was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. “i regret that i have kept you waiting,” said i, sitting down in my library-chair. “you are fresh from a night journey, i understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.” “oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. he laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh. “stop it!” i cried; “pull yourself together!” and i poured out some water from a caraffe. it was useless, however. he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. presently he came to himself once more, very weary and blushing hotly. “i have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped. “not at all. drink this.” i dashed some brandy into the water, and the color began to come back to his bloodless cheeks. “that’s better!” said he. “and now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.” he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots. “good heavens!” i cried, “this is a terrible injury. it must have bled considerably.” “yes, it did. i fainted when it was done, and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time. when i came to i found that it was still bleeding, so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.” “excellent! you should have been a surgeon.” “it is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.” “this has been done,” said i, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and sharp instrument.” “a thing like a cleaver,” said he. “an accident, i presume?” “by no means.” “what! a murderous attack?” “very murderous indeed.” “you horrify me.” i sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. he lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time. “how is that?” i asked, when i had finished. “capital! between your brandy and your bandage, i feel a new man. i was very weak, but i have had a good deal to go through.” “perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. it is evidently trying to your nerves.” “oh no, not now. i shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, i should be surprised if they believed my statement; for it is a very extraordinary one, and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.” “ha!” cried i, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr. sherlock holmes before you go to the official police.” “oh, i have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course i must use the official police as well. would you give me an introduction to him?” “i’ll do better. i’ll take you round to him myself.” “i should be immensely obliged to you.” “we’ll call a cab and go together. we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. do you feel equal to it?” “yes; i shall not feel easy until i have told my story.” “then my servant will call a cab, and i shall be with you in an instant.” i rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to baker street. sherlock holmes was, as i expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _the times_, and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantel-piece. he received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy-and-water within his reach. “it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, mr. hatherley,” said he. “pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.” “thank you,” said my patient, “but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure. i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.” holmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while i sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us. “you must know,” said he, “that i am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in london. by profession i am an hydraulic engineer, and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner & matheson, the well-known firm, of greenwich. two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, i determined to start in business for myself, and took professional chambers in victoria street. “i suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. to me it has been exceptionally so. during two years i have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. my gross takings amount to £27 10_s._ every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, i waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all. “yesterday, however, just as i was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. he brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘colonel lysander stark’ engraved upon it. close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man. his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. he was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, i should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty. “‘mr. hatherley?’ said he, with something of a german accent. ‘you have been recommended to me, mr. hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.’ “i bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. ‘may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’ “‘well, perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment. i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor, and are residing alone in london.’ “‘that is quite correct,’ i answered, ‘but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. i understood that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?’ “‘undoubtedly so. but you will find that all i say is really to the point. i have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential—_absolute_ secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’ “‘if i promise to keep a secret,’ said i, ‘you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.’ “he looked very hard at me as i spoke, and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye. “‘do you promise, then?’ said he, at last. “‘yes, i promise.’ “‘absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? no reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’ “‘i have already given you my word.’ “‘very good.’ he suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room, he flung open the door. the passage outside was empty. “‘that’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. now we can talk in safety.’ he drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look. “a feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience. “‘i beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said i; ‘my time is of value.’ heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips. “‘how would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked. “‘most admirably.’ “‘i say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. what do you think of such a commission as that?’ “‘the work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’ “‘precisely so. we shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’ “‘where to?’ “‘to eyford, in berkshire. it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire, and within seven miles of reading. there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.’ “‘very good.’ “‘i shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’ “‘there is a drive, then?’ “‘yes, our little place is quite out in the country. it is a good seven miles from eyford station.’ “‘then we can hardly get there before midnight. i suppose there would be no chance of a train back. i should be compelled to stop the night.’ “‘yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’ “‘that is very awkward. could i not come at some more convenient hour?’ “‘we have judged it best that you should come late. it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’ “i thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. ‘not at all,’ said i, ‘i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. i should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’ “‘quite so. it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’ “‘entirely.’ “‘then the matter stands thus. you are probably aware that fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in england?’ “‘i have heard so.’ “‘some little time ago i bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of reading. i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. on examining it, however, i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbors. these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value; but, unfortunately, i had no capital by which i could do this. i took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighboring fields. this we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press. this press, as i have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. we guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford to-night. i hope that i make it all plain?’ “‘i quite follow you,’ said i. ‘the only point which i could not quite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as i understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.’ “‘ah!’ said he, carelessly, ‘we have our own process. we compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. but that is a mere detail. i have taken you fully into my confidence now, mr. hatherley, and i have shown you how i trust you.’ he rose as he spoke. ‘i shall expect you, then, at eyford at 11.15.’ “‘i shall certainly be there.’ “‘and not a word to a soul.’ he looked at me with a last, long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room. “well, when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. on the one hand, of course, i was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. on the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell any one of my errand. however, i threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue. [illustration: “‘not a word to a soul’”] “at reading i had to change not only my carriage, but my station. however, i was in time for the last train to eyford, and i reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. i was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. as i passed out through the wicket gate, however, i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. he drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.” “one horse?” interjected holmes. “yes, only one.” “did you observe the color?” “yes, i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the carriage. it was a chestnut.” “tired-looking or fresh?” “oh, fresh and glossy.” “thank you. i am sorry to have interrupted you. pray continue your most interesting statement.” “away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles, but i should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. he sat at my side in silence all the time, and i was aware, more than once when i glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. at last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. colonel lysander stark sprang out, and, as i followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. we stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away. “it was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches, and muttering under his breath. suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. it grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. i could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material. she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. colonel stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand. “‘perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. it was a quiet, little, plainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several german books were scattered. colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘i shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness. “i glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. then i walked across to the window, hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. it was a wonderfully silent house. there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. who were these german people, and what were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? and where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford, that was all i knew, but whether north, south, east, or west i had no idea. for that matter, reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. i paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits, and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee. “suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. the woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her. “‘i would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; ‘i would go. i should not stay here. there is no good for you to do.’ “‘but, madam,’ said i, ‘i have not yet done what i came for. i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine.’ “‘it is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘you can pass through the door; no one hinders.’ and then, seeing that i smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘for the love of heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’ “but i am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. i thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. was it all to go for nothing? why should i slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? this woman might, for all i knew, be a monomaniac. with a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess, i still shook my head, and declared my intention of remaining where i was. she was about to renew her entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps were heard upon the stairs. she listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come. “the new-comers were colonel lysander stark and a short, thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as mr. ferguson. “‘this is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘by-the-way, i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now. i fear that you have felt the draught.’ “‘on the contrary,’ said i, ‘i opened the door myself, because i felt the room to be a little close.’ “he shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘mr. ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine.’ “‘i had better put my hat on, i suppose.’ “‘oh no, it is in the house.’ “‘what, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’ “‘no, no. this is only where we compress it. but never mind that. all we wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is wrong with it.’ “we went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager, and i behind him. it was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though i disregarded them, and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions. ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman. “colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in. “‘we are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to turn it on. the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. the machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.’ “i took the lamp from him, and i examined the machine very thoroughly. it was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. when i passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. an examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. this was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and i pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. when i had made it clear to them, i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. the walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when i heard a muttered exclamation in german, and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me. “‘what are you doing there?’ he asked. “i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. ‘i was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said i; ‘i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’ “the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech. his face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray eyes. “‘very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ he took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘hello!’ i yelled. ‘hello! colonel! let me out!’ “and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. he had set the engine at work. the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough. by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. i threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. i implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard, rough surface. then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it. if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? already i was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart. “i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. as i gave a last hurried glance around, i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. the next instant i threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. the panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape. “i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected. “‘come! come!’ she cried, breathlessly. ‘they will be here in a moment. they will see that you are not there. oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!’ “this time, at least, i did not scorn her advice. i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. the latter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits’ end. then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly. “‘it is your only chance,’ said she. ‘it is high, but it may be that you can jump it.’ “as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s cleaver in the other. i rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. i clambered out upon the sill, but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who pursued me. if she were ill-used, then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance. the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back. “‘fritz! fritz!’ she cried, in english, ‘remember your promise after the last time. you said it should not be again. he will be silent! oh, he will be silent!’ “‘you are mad, elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her. ‘you will be the ruin of us. he has seen too much. let me pass, i say!’ he dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. i had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. i was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and i fell into the garden below. “i was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run, for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet. suddenly, however, as i ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. i glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. i endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes. “how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell. it must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself. my clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s adventure, and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. but, to my astonishment, when i came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night. were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream. “half dazed, i went into the station and asked about the morning train. there would be one to reading in less than an hour. the same porter was on duty, i found, as had been there when i arrived. i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark. the name was strange to him. had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? no, he had not. was there a police-station anywhere near? there was one about three miles off. “it was too far for me to go, weak and ill as i was. i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police. it was a little past six when i arrived, so i went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. i put the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.” we both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this extraordinary narrative. then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings. “here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “it appeared in all the papers about a year ago. listen to this: ‘lost, on the 9th inst., mr. jeremiah hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic engineer. left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been heard of since. was dressed in,’ etc., etc. ha! that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, i fancy.” “good heavens!” cried my patient. “then that explains what the girl said.” “undoubtedly. it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford.” some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from reading to the little berkshire village. there were sherlock holmes, the hydraulic engineer, inspector bradstreet, of scotland yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre. “there you are,” said he. “that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. the place we want must be somewhere near that line. you said ten miles, i think, sir.” “it was an hour’s good drive.” “and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?” “they must have done so. i have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.” “what i cannot understand,” said i, “is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.” “i hardly think that likely. i never saw a more inexorable face in my life.” “oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said bradstreet. “well, i have drawn my circle, and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.” “i think i could lay my finger on it,” said holmes, quietly. “really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion! come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. i say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.” “and i say east,” said my patient. “i am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “there are several quiet little villages up there.” “and i am for north,” said i, “because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.” “come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of opinion. we have boxed the compass among us. who do you give your casting vote to?” “you are all wrong.” “but we can’t _all_ be.” “oh yes, you can. this is my point;” he placed his finger in the centre of the circle. “this is where we shall find them.” “but the twelve-mile drive?” gasped hatherley. “six out and six back. nothing simpler. you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?” “indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed bradstreet, thoughtfully. “of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.” “none at all,” said holmes. “they are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.” “we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the inspector. “they have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. we even traced them as far as reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. but now, thanks to this lucky chance, i think that we have got them right enough.” but the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape. “a house on fire?” asked bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on its way. “yes, sir!” said the station-master. “when did it break out?” “i hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.” “whose house is it?” “dr. becher’s.” “tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is dr. becher a german, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?” the station-master laughed heartily. “no, sir, dr. becher is an englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. but he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as i understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm.” the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. the road topped a low hill, and there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under. “that’s it!” cried hatherley, in intense excitement. “there is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where i lay. that second window is the one that i jumped from.” “well, at least,” said holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them. there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.” and holmes’s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister german, or the morose englishman. early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even holmes’s ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clew as to their whereabouts. the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. about sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to. how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. he had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. on the whole, it was most probable that the silent englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger. “well,” said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once more to london, “it has been a pretty business for me! i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have i gained?” “experience,” said holmes, laughing. “indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.” adventure x the adventure of the noble bachelor the lord st. simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. as i have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode. it was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. i had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign, throbbed with dull persistency. with my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers, until at last, saturated with the news of the day, i tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble correspondent could be. “here is a very fashionable epistle,” i remarked, as he entered. “your morning letters, if i remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.” “yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting. this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.” he broke the seal and glanced over the contents. “oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.” “not social, then?” “no, distinctly professional.” “and from a noble client?” “one of the highest in england.” “my dear fellow, i congratulate you.” “i assure you, watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. it is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. you have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?” “it looks like it,” said i, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. “i have had nothing else to do.” “it is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. the latter is always instructive. but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st. simon and his wedding?” “oh yes, with the deepest interest.” “that is well. the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st. simon. i will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. this is what he says: “‘my dear mr. sherlock holmes,—lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. i have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. i will call at four o’clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, i hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. yours faithfully, st. simon.’ “it is dated from grosvenor mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,” remarked holmes, as he folded up the epistle. “he says four o’clock. it is three now. he will be here in an hour.” “then i have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while i take a glance as to who our client is.” he picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantel-piece. “here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. “lord robert walsingham de vere st. simon, second son of the duke of balmoral—hum! arms: azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. born in 1846. he’s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration. the duke, his father, was at one time secretary for foreign affairs. they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent, and tudor on the distaff side. ha! well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. i think that i must turn to you, watson, for something more solid.” “i have very little difficulty in finding what i want,” said i, “for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. i feared to refer them to you, however, as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.” “oh, you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van. that is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.” “here is the first notice which i can find. it is in the personal column of _the morning post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back. ‘a marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumor is correct, very shortly take place, between lord robert st. simon, second son of the duke of balmoral, and miss hatty doran, the only daughter of aloysius doran, esq., of san francisco, cal., u.s.a.’ that is all.” “terse and to the point,” remarked holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire. “there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. ah, here it is. ‘there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic. an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. lord st. simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran, the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire. miss doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as lord st. simon has no property of his own, save the small estate of birchmoor, it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress.’” “anything else?” asked holmes, yawning. “oh yes; plenty. then there is another note in _the morning post_ to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at st. george’s, hanover square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr. aloysius doran. two days later—that is, on wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honey-moon would be passed at lord backwater’s place, near petersfield. those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.” “before the what?” asked holmes, with a start. “the vanishing of the lady.” “when did she vanish, then?” “at the wedding breakfast.” “indeed. this is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.” “yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.” “they often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honey-moon; but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. pray let me have the details.” “i warn you that they are very incomplete.” “perhaps we may make them less so.” “such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which i will read to you. it is headed, ‘singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding’: “‘the family of lord robert st. simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. the ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumors which have been so persistently floating about. in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation. “‘the ceremony, which was performed at st. george’s, hanover square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, mr. aloysius doran, the duchess of balmoral, lord backwater, lord eustace, and lady clara st. simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and lady alicia whittington. the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr. aloysius doran, at lancaster gate, where breakfast had been prepared. it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon lord st. simon. it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. the bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room. her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, mr. aloysius doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. there are rumors of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.’” “and is that all?” “only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.” “and it is—” “that miss flora millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. it appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_ at the ‘allegro,’ and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. there are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.” “and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. i would not have missed it for worlds. but there is a ring at the bell, watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. do not dream of going, watson, for i very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.” “lord robert st. simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. a gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. his manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. his hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. as to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored gaiters. he advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eye-glasses. “good-day, lord st. simon,” said holmes, rising and bowing. “pray take the basket-chair. this is my friend and colleague, dr. watson. draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.” “a most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, mr. holmes. i have been cut to the quick. i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.” “no, i am descending.” “i beg pardon.” “my last client of the sort was a king.” “oh, really! i had no idea. and which king?” “the king of scandinavia.” “what! had he lost his wife?” “you can understand,” said holmes, suavely, “that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours.” “of course! very right! very right! i’m sure i beg pardon. as to my own case, i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.” “thank you. i have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. i presume that i may take it as correct—this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.” lord st. simon glanced over it. “yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.” “but it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer an opinion. i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.” “pray do so.” “when did you first meet miss hatty doran?” “in san francisco, a year ago.” “you were travelling in the states?” “yes.” “did you become engaged then?” “no.” “but you were on a friendly footing?” “i was amused by her society, and she could see that i was amused.” “her father is very rich?” “he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope.” “and how did he make his money?” “in mining. he had nothing a few years ago. then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.” “now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s character?” the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. “you see, mr. holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. during that time she ran free in a mining camp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from nature rather than from the school-master. she is what we call in england a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. she is impetuous—volcanic, i was about to say. she is swift in making up her mind, and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. on the other hand, i would not have given her the name which i have the honor to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had not i thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. i believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything dishonorable would be repugnant to her.” “have you her photograph?” “i brought this with me.” he opened a locket, and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. it was not a photograph, but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st. simon. “the young lady came to london, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?” “yes, her father brought her over for this last london season. i met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.” “she brought, i understand, a considerable dowry?” “a fair dowry. not more than is usual in my family.” “and this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait accompli_?” “i really have made no inquiries on the subject.” “very naturally not. did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding?” “yes.” “was she in good spirits?” “never better. she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.” “indeed! that is very interesting. and on the morning of the wedding?” “she was as bright as possible—at least, until after the ceremony.” “and did you observe any change in her then?” “well, to tell the truth, i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. the incident, however, was too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the case.” “pray let us have it, for all that.” “oh, it is childish. she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. she was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. there was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. yet, when i spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.” “indeed! you say that there was a gentleman in the pew. some of the general public were present, then?” “oh yes. it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.” “this gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?” “no, no; i call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. i hardly noticed his appearance. but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point.” “lady st. simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. what did she do on re-entering her father’s house?” “i saw her in conversation with her maid.” “and who is her maid?” “alice is her name. she is an american, and came from california with her.” “a confidential servant?” “a little too much so. it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. still, of course, in america they look upon these things in a different way.” “how long did she speak to this alice?” “oh, a few minutes. i had something else to think of.” “you did not overhear what they said?” “lady st. simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ she was accustomed to use slang of the kind. i have no idea what she meant.” “american slang is very expressive sometimes. and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?” “she walked into the breakfast-room.” “on your arm?” “no, alone. she was very independent in little matters like that. then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. she never came back.” “but this maid, alice, as i understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.” “quite so. and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at mr. doran’s house that morning.” “ah, yes. i should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.” lord st. simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “we have been on a friendly footing for some years—i may say on a _very_ friendly footing. she used to be at the ‘allegro.’ i have not treated her ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me; but you know what women are, mr. holmes. flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married; and, to tell the truth, the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. she came to mr. doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and i had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.” “did your wife hear all this?” “no, thank goodness, she did not.” “and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?” “yes. that is what mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, looks upon as so serious. it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some terrible trap for her.” “well, it is a possible supposition.” “you think so, too?” “i did not say a probable one. but you do not yourself look upon this as likely?” “i do not think flora would hurt a fly.” “still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. pray what is your own theory as to what took place?” “well, really, i came to seek a theory, not to propound one. i have given you all the facts. since you ask me, however, i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.” “in short, that she had become suddenly deranged?” “well, really, when i consider that she has turned her back—i will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—i can hardly explain it in any other fashion.” “well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said holmes, smiling. “and now, lord st. simon, i think that i have nearly all my data. may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?” “we could see the other side of the road and the park.” “quite so. then i do not think that i need to detain you longer. i shall communicate with you.” “should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our client, rising. “i have solved it.” “eh? what was that?” “i say that i have solved it.” “where, then, is my wife?” “that is a detail which i shall speedily supply.” lord st. simon shook his head. “i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner, he departed. “it is very good of lord st. simon to honor my head by putting it on a level with his own,” said sherlock holmes, laughing. “i think that i shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.” “my dear holmes!” “i have notes of several similar cases, though none, as i remarked before, which were quite as prompt. my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote thoreau’s example.” “but i have heard all that you have heard.” “without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco-prussian war. it is one of these cases—but, hello, here is lestrade! good-afternoon, lestrade! you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.” the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him. “what’s up, then?” asked holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. “you look dissatisfied.” “and i feel dissatisfied. it is this infernal st. simon marriage case. i can make neither head nor tail of the business.” “really! you surprise me.” “who ever heard of such a mixed affair? every clew seems to slip through my fingers. i have been at work upon it all day.” “and very wet it seems to have made you,” said holmes, laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket. “yes, i have been dragging the serpentine.” “in heaven’s name, what for?” “in search of the body of lady st. simon.” sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily. “have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain?” he asked. “why? what do you mean?” “because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.” lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “i suppose you know all about it,” he snarled. “well, i have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.” “oh, indeed! then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter?” “i think it very unlikely.” “then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” he opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discolored and soaked in water. “there,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “there is a little nut for you to crack, master holmes.” “oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “you dragged them from the serpentine?” “no. they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. they have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.” “by the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in the neighborhood of his wardrobe. and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?” “at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance.” “i am afraid that you will find it difficult.” “are you, indeed, now?” cried lestrade, with some bitterness. “i am afraid, holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. you have made two blunders in as many minutes. this dress does implicate miss flora millar.” “and how?” “in the dress is a pocket. in the pocket is a card-case. in the card-case is a note. and here is the very note.” he slapped it down upon the table in front of him. “listen to this: ‘you will see me when all is ready. come at once. f. h. m.’ now my theory all along has been that lady st. simon was decoyed away by flora millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within their reach.” “very good, lestrade,” said holmes, laughing. “you really are very fine indeed. let me see it.” he took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. “this is indeed important,” said he. “ha! you find it so?” “extremely so. i congratulate you warmly.” lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “why,” he shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!” “on the contrary, this is the right side.” “the right side? you’re mad! here is the note written in pencil over here.” “and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.” “there’s nothing in it. i looked at it before,” said lestrade. “‘oct. 4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._ 6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d._’ i see nothing in that.” “very likely not. it is most important, all the same. as to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so i congratulate you again.” “i’ve wasted time enough,” said lestrade, rising. “i believe in hard work, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. good-day, mr. holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.” he gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door. “just one hint to you, lestrade,” drawled holmes, before his rival vanished; “i will tell you the true solution of the matter. lady st. simon is a myth. there is not, and there never has been, any such person.” lestrade looked sadly at my companion. then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away. he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose and put on his overcoat. “there is something in what the fellow says about out-door work,” he remarked, “so i think, watson, that i must leave you to your papers for a little.” it was after five o’clock when sherlock holmes left me, but i had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s man with a very large flat box. this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie, with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the arabian nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address. just before nine o’clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room. his features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions. “they have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands. “you seem to expect company. they have laid for five.” “yes, i fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “i am surprised that lord st. simon has not already arrived. ha! i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs.” it was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features. “my messenger reached you, then?” asked holmes. “yes, and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. have you good authority for what you say?” “the best possible.” lord st. simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead. “what will the duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?” “it is the purest accident. i cannot allow that there is any humiliation.” “ah, you look on these things from another stand-point.” “i fail to see that any one is to blame. i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.” “it was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said lord st. simon, tapping his fingers upon the table. “you must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.” “i will make no allowance. i am very angry indeed, and i have been shamefully used.” “i think that i heard a ring,” said holmes. “yes, there are steps on the landing. if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, lord st. simon, i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.” he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. “lord st. simon,” said he, “allow me to introduce you to mr. and mrs. francis hay moulton. the lady, i think, you have already met.” at the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. it was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist. “you’re angry, robert,” said she. “well, i guess you have every cause to be.” “pray make no apology to me,” said lord st. simon, bitterly. “oh yes, i know that i have treated you real bad, and that i should have spoken to you before i went; but i was kind of rattled, and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn’t know what i was doing or saying. i only wonder i didn’t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.” “perhaps, mrs. moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?” “if i may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. for my part, i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it.” he was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner. “then i’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “frank here and i met in ’84, in mcquire’s camp, near the rockies, where pa was working a claim. we were engaged to each other, frank and i; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. the richer pa grew, the poorer was frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to ’frisco. frank wouldn’t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. it would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time, and pledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. ‘why shouldn’t we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then i will feel sure of you; and i won’t claim to be your husband until i come back?’ well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then frank went off to seek his fortune, and i went back to pa. “the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana, and then he went prospecting in arizona, and then i heard of him from new mexico. after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been attacked by apache indians, and there was my frank’s name among the killed. i fainted dead away, and i was very sick for months after. pa thought i had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in ’frisco. not a word of news came for a year and more, so that i never doubted that frank was really dead. then lord st. simon came to ’frisco, and we came to london, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank. “still, if i had married lord st. simon, of course i’d have done my duty by him. we can’t command our love, but we can our actions. i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. but you may imagine what i felt when, just as i came to the altar rails, i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. i thought it was his ghost at first; but when i looked again, there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him. i wonder i didn’t drop. i know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. i didn’t know what to do. should i stop the service and make a scene in the church? i glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what i was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and i knew that he was writing me a note. as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and i determined to do just whatever he might direct. “when i got back i told my maid, who had known him in california, and had always been his friend. i ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. i know i ought to have spoken to lord st. simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. i hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road. he beckoned to me, and then began walking into the park. i slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. some woman came talking something or other about lord st. simon to me—seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but i managed to get away from her, and soon overtook frank. we got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. frank had been a prisoner among the apaches, had escaped, came on to ’frisco, found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.” “i saw it in a paper,” explained the american. “it gave the name and the church, but not where the lady lived.” “then we had a talk as to what we should do, and frank was all for openness, but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that i was alive. it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. so frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that i should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, mr. holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than i can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st. simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. now, robert, you have heard it all, and i am very sorry if i have given you pain, and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me.” lord st. simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative. “excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.” “then you won’t forgive me? you won’t shake hands before i go?” “oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him. “i had hoped,” suggested holmes, “that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.” “i think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his lordship. “i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them. i think that, with your permission, i will now wish you all a very good-night.” he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room. “then i trust that you at least will honor me with your company,” said sherlock holmes. “it is always a joy to meet an american, mr. moulton, for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes.” * * * * * “the case has been an interesting one,” remarked holmes, when our visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by mr. lestrade, of scotland yard.” [illustration: “‘i will wish you all a very good night.’”] “you were not yourself at fault at all, then?” “from the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. what could that something be? she could not have spoken to any one when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. had she seen some one, then? if she had, it must be some one from america, because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed any one to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. you see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an american. then who could this american be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? it might be a lover; it might be a husband. her young womanhood had, i knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. so far i had got before i ever heard lord st. simon’s narrative. when he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. she had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favor of the latter.” “and how in the world did you find them?” “it might have been difficult, but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. the initials were of course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels.” “how did you deduce the select?” “by the select prices. eight shillings for a bed and eight-pence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. there are not many in london which charge at that rate. in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue, i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h. moulton, an american gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill. his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square; so thither i travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, i ventured to give them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st. simon in particular. i invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, i made him keep the appointment.” “but with no very good result,” i remarked. “his conduct was certainly not very gracious.” “ah, watson,” said holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. i think that we may judge lord st. simon very mercifully, and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. draw your chair up, and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.” adventure xi the adventure of the beryl coronet “holmes,” said i, as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, “here is a madman coming along. it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.” my friend rose lazily from his arm-chair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. it was a bright, crisp february morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. the gray pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. indeed, from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention. he was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. as he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions. “what on earth can be the matter with him?” i asked. “he is looking up at the numbers of the houses.” “i believe that he is coming here,” said holmes, rubbing his hands. “here?” “yes; i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. i think that i recognize the symptoms. ha! did i not tell you?” as he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging. a few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. for a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ. “you have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “you are fatigued with your haste. pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.” the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us. “no doubt you think me mad?” said he. “i see that you have had some great trouble,” responded holmes. “god knows i have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. public disgrace i might have faced, although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. besides, it is not i alone. the very noblest in the land may suffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.” “pray compose yourself, sir,” said holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.” “my name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. i am alexander holder, of the banking firm of holder & stevenson, of threadneedle street.” the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london. what could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass? we waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story. “i feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your co-operation. i came to baker street by the underground, and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. that is why i was so out of breath, for i am a man who takes very little exercise. i feel better now, and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can. “it is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate. “yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. i started when i saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in england. i was overwhelmed by the honor, and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task. “‘mr. holder,’ said he, ‘i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’ “‘the firm do so when the security is good,’ i answered. “‘it is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that i should have £50,000 at once. i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but i much prefer to make it a matter of business, and to carry out that business myself. in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’ “‘for how long, may i ask, do you want this sum?’ i asked. “‘next monday i have a large sum due to me, and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’ “‘i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said i, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. if, on the other hand, i am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner i must insist that, even in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken.’ “‘i should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet?’ “‘one of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said i. “‘precisely.’ he opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewelry which he had named. ‘there are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked. i am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’ “i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client. “‘you doubt its value?’ he asked. “‘not at all. i only doubt—’ “‘the propriety of my leaving it. you may set your mind at rest about that. i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it. it is a pure matter of form. is the security sufficient?’ “‘ample.’ “‘you understand, mr. holder, that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you, founded upon all that i have heard of you. i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution, because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. i leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and i shall call for it in person on monday morning.’ “seeing that my client was anxious to leave, i said no more; but, calling for my cashier, i ordered him to pay over fifty £1000 notes. when i was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. there could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. however, it was too late to alter the matter now, so i locked it up in my private safe, and turned once more to my work. “when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? if so, how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself! i determined, therefore, that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. with this intention, i called a cab, and drove out to my house at streatham, carrying the jewel with me. i did not breathe freely until i had taken it up-stairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room. “and now a word as to my household, mr. holmes, for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. my groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. i have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. another, lucy parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. she came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. she is a very pretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. that is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way. “so much for the servants. my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. i am a widower, and have an only son, arthur. he has been a disappointment to me, mr. holmes—a grievous disappointment. i have no doubt that i am myself to blame. people tell me that i have spoiled him. very likely i have. when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love. i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. i have never denied him a wish. perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner, but i meant it for the best. “it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. he was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honor. he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again. “and, indeed, i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. he is older than arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. yet when i think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, i am convinced from his cynical speech, and the look which i have caught in his eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. so i think, and so, too, thinks my little mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character. “and now there is only she to be described. she is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. she is a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. she is my right hand. i do not know what i could do without her. in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. i think that if any one could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—for ever too late! “now, mr. holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and i shall continue with my miserable story. “when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after dinner, i told arthur and mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. lucy parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, i am sure, left the room; but i cannot swear that the door was closed. mary and arthur were much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but i thought it better not to disturb it. “‘where have you put it?’ asked arthur. “‘in my own bureau.’ “‘well, i hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the night,’ said he. “‘it is locked up,’ i answered. “‘oh, any old key will fit that bureau. when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’ “he often had a wild way of talking, so that i thought little of what he said. he followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face. “‘look here, dad,’ said he, with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me have £200?’ “‘no, i cannot!’ i answered, sharply. ‘i have been far too generous with you in money matters.’ “‘you have been very kind,’ said he: ‘but i must have this money, or else i can never show my face inside the club again.’ “‘and a very good thing, too!’ i cried. “‘yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,’ said he. ‘i could not bear the disgrace. i must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then i must try other means.’ “i was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘you shall not have a farthing from me,’ i cried; on which he bowed and left the room without another word. “when he was gone i unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which i usually leave to mary, but which i thought it well to perform myself that night. as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as i approached. “‘tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, i thought, a little disturbed, ‘did you give lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’ “‘certainly not.’ “‘she came in just now by the back door. i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see some one; but i think that it is hardly safe, and should be stopped.” “‘you must speak to her in the morning, or i will, if you prefer it. are you sure that everything is fastened?’ “‘quite sure, dad.’ “‘then, good-night.’ i kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again, where i was soon asleep. “i am endeavoring to tell you everything, mr. holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear.” “on the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.” “i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so. i am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. about two in the morning, then, i was awakened by some sound in the house. it had ceased ere i was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. i lay listening with all my ears. suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. i slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door. “‘arthur!’ i screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! how dare you touch that coronet?’ “the gas was half up, as i had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. he appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. at my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and turned as pale as death. i snatched it up and examined it. one of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing. “‘you blackguard!’ i shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘you have destroyed it! you have dishonored me for ever! where are the jewels which you have stolen?’ “‘stolen!’ he cried. “‘yes, you thief!’ i roared, shaking him by the shoulder. “‘there are none missing. there cannot be any missing,’ said he. “‘there are three missing. and you know where they are. must i call you a liar as well as a thief? did i not see you trying to tear off another piece?’ “‘you have called me names enough,’ said he; ‘i will not stand it any longer. i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me. i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.’ “‘you shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ i cried, half-mad with grief and rage. ‘i shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’ “‘you shall learn nothing from me,’ said he, with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature. ‘if you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.’ “by this time the whole house was astir, for i had raised my voice in my anger. mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of arthur’s face, she read the whole story, and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. i sent the house-maid for the police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. when the inspector and a constable entered the house, arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. i was determined that the law should have its way in everything. “‘at least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes.’ “‘that you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,’ said i. and then realizing the dreadful position in which i was placed, i implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones. “‘you may as well face the matter,’ said i; ‘you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. if you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’ “‘keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning away from me, with a sneer. i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. there was but one way for it. i called in the inspector, and gave him into custody. a search was made at once, not only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. this morning he was removed to a cell, and i, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. you may go to any expense which you think necessary. i have already offered a reward of £1000. my god, what shall i do! i have lost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. oh, what shall i do!” he put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words. sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire. “do you receive much company?” he asked. “none, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of arthur’s. sir george burnwell has been several times lately. no one else, i think.” “do you go out much in society?” “arthur does. mary and i stay at home. we neither of us care for it.” “that is unusual in a young girl.” “she is of a quiet nature. besides, she is not so very young. she is four-and-twenty.” “this matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.” “terrible! she is even more affected than i.” “you have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?” “how can we have, when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.” “i hardly consider that a conclusive proof. was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?” “yes, it was twisted.” “do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?” “god bless you! you are doing what you can for him and for me. but it is too heavy a task. what was he doing there at all? if his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?” “precisely. and if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? his silence appears to me to cut both ways. there are several singular points about the case. what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?” “they considered that it might be caused by arthur’s closing his bedroom door.” “a likely story! as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. what did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?” “they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.” “have they thought of looking outside the house?” “yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. the whole garden has already been minutely examined.” “now, my dear sir,” said holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? it appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. consider what is involved by your theory. you suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. i ask you now, is such a theory tenable?” “but what other is there?” cried the banker, with a gesture of despair. “if his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?” “it is our task to find that out,” replied holmes; “so now, if you please, mr. holder, we will set off for streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.” my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which i was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. i confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still i had such faith in holmes’s judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier. fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. a double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. on the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. on the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. holmes left us standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. so long was he that mr. holder and i went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. she was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress. “you have given orders that arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?” she asked. “no, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.” “but i am so sure that he is innocent. you know what women’s instincts are. i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.” “why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?” “who knows? perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.” “how could i help suspecting him, when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?” “oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. oh do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. let the matter drop and say no more. it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison!” “i shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, mary! your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. far from hushing the thing up, i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it.” “this gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me. “no, his friend. he wished us to leave him alone. he is round in the stable lane now.” “the stable lane?” she raised her dark eyebrows. “what can he hope to find there? ah! this, i suppose, is he. i trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what i feel sure is the truth, that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime.” “i fully share your opinion, and i trust, with you, that we may prove it,” returned holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. “i believe i have the honor of addressing miss mary holder. might i ask you a question or two?” “pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.” “you heard nothing yourself last night?” “nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. i heard that, and i came down.” “you shut up the windows and doors the night before. did you fasten all the windows?” “yes.” “were they all fastened this morning?” “yes.” “you have a maid who has a sweetheart? i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?” “yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.” “i see. you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.” “but what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker, impatiently, “when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands?” “wait a little, mr. holder. we must come back to that. about this girl, miss holder. you saw her return by the kitchen door, i presume?” “yes; when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in. i saw the man, too, in the gloom.” “do you know him?” “oh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. his name is francis prosper.” “he stood,” said holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?” “yes, he did.” “and he is a man with a wooden leg?” something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes. “why, you are like a magician,” said she. “how do you know that?” she smiled, but there was no answering smile in holmes’s thin, eager face. “i should be very glad now to go up-stairs,” said he. “i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up.” he walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. this he opened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. “now we shall go up-stairs,” said he, at last. the banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock. “which key was used to open it?” he asked. “that which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.” “have you it here?” “that is it on the dressing-table.” sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau. “it is a noiseless lock,” said he. “it is no wonder that it did not wake you. this case, i presume, contains the coronet. we must have a look at it.” he opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it upon the table. it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i have ever seen. at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away. “now, mr. holder,” said holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. might i beg that you will break it off.” the banker recoiled in horror. “i should not dream of trying,” said he. “then i will.” holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. “i feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. an ordinary man could not do it. now, what do you think would happen if i did break it, mr. holder? there would be a noise like a pistol shot. do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?” “i do not know what to think. it is all dark to me.” “but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. what do you think, miss holder?” “i confess that i still share my uncle’s perplexity.” “your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?” “he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.” “thank you. we have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. with your permission, mr. holder, i shall now continue my investigations outside.” he went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. for an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever. “i think that i have seen now all that there is to see, mr. holder,” said he; “i can serve you best by returning to my rooms.” “but the gems, mr. holmes. where are they?” “i cannot tell.” the banker wrung his hands. “i shall never see them again!” he cried. “and my son? you give me hopes?” “my opinion is in no way altered.” “then, for god’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?” “if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer. i understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you, provided only that i get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw.” “i would give my fortune to have them back.” “very good. i shall look into the matter between this and then. good-bye; it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening.” it was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine. several times during our homeward journey i endeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last i gave it over in despair. it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. he hurried to his chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. with his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class. “i think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. “i only wish that you could come with me, watson, but i fear that it won’t do. i may be on the trail in this matter, or i may be following a will-of-the-wisp, but i shall soon know which it is. i hope that i may be back in a few hours.” he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off upon his expedition. i had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea. “i only looked in as i passed,” said he. “i am going right on.” “where to?” “oh, to the other side of the west end. it may be some time before i get back. don’t wait up for me in case i should be late.” “how are you getting on?” “oh, so so. nothing to complain of. i have been out to streatham since i saw you last, but i did not call at the house. it is a very sweet little problem, and i would not have missed it for a good deal. however, i must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.” i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. his eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. he hastened up-stairs, and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt. i waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so i retired to my room. it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. i do not know at what hour he came in, but when i came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible. “you will excuse my beginning without you, watson,” said he; “but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.” “why, it is after nine now,” i answered. “i should not be surprised if that were he. i thought i heard a ring.” it was, indeed, our friend the financier. i was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which i pushed forward for him. “i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried,” said he. “only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. now i am left to a lonely and dishonored age. one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. my niece, mary, has deserted me.” “deserted you?” “yes. her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. i had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. it is to that remark that she refers in this note: “‘my dearest uncle,—i feel that i have brought trouble upon you, and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. i cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and i feel that i must leave you for ever. do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to me. in life or in death, i am ever your loving mary.’ “what could she mean by that note, mr. holmes? do you think it points to suicide?” “no, no, nothing of the kind. it is perhaps the best possible solution. i trust, mr. holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.” “ha! you say so! you have heard something, mr. holmes; you have learned something! where are the gems?” “you would not think £1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?” “i would pay ten.” “that would be unnecessary. three thousand will cover the matter. and there is a little reward, i fancy. have you your check-book? here is a pen. better make it out for £4000 pounds.” with a dazed face the banker made out the required check. holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table. with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up. “you have it!” he gasped. “i am saved! i am saved!” the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom. “there is one other thing you owe, mr. holder,” said sherlock holmes, rather sternly. “owe!” he caught up a pen. “name the sum, and i will pay it.” “no, the debt is not to me. you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do, should i ever chance to have one.” “then it was not arthur who took them?” “i told you yesterday, and i repeat to-day, that it was not.” “you are sure of it! then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know that the truth is known.” “he knows it already. when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, i told it to him, on which he had to confess that i was right, and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.” “for heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!” “i will do so, and i will show you the steps by which i reached it. and let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary. they have now fled together.” “my mary? impossible!” “it is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. he is one of the most dangerous men in england—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. your niece knew nothing of such men. when he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. the devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.” “i cannot, and i will not, believe it!” cried the banker, with an ashen face. “i will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. his footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. she told him of the coronet. his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. i have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and i think that she must have been one. she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming down-stairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true. “your boy, arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your dressing-room. petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. she passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. he saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain. “as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. but the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. he rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. sir george burnwell tried to get away, but arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. in the scuffle, your son struck sir george, and cut him over the eye. then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and was endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.” “is it possible?” gasped the banker. “you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. he took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.” “and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,” cried mr. holder. “oh, my god! what a blind fool i have been! and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. how cruelly i have misjudged him!” “when i arrived at the house,” continued holmes, “i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. i knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. i passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. i could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which i took to be the police; but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me. “there was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. the first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. i followed them up, and found that they led to the hall window, where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. then i walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. i saw where boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that i was not mistaken. boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. when he came to the high-road at the other end, i found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clew. “on entering the house, however, i examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and i could at once see that some one had passed out. i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. a man had waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled with him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. he had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. so far i was clear. the question now was, who was the man, and who was it brought him the coronet? “it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. now, i knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. but if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? there could be no possible reason. as he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. when i remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty. “and who could it be who was her confederate? a lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? i knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. but among them was sir george burnwell. i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. even though he knew that arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family. “well, your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next. i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george’s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. with these i journeyed down to streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.” [illustration: “i clapped a pistol to his head”] “i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said mr. holder. “precisely. it was i. i found that i had my man, so i came home and changed my clothes. it was a delicate part which i had to play then, for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. i went and saw him. at first, of course, he denied everything. but when i gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. i knew my man, however, and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. then he became a little more reasonable. i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£1000 apiece. that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘i’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. off i set to him, and after much chaffering i got our stones at £1000 apiece. then i looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock, after what i may call a really hard day’s work.” “a day which has saved england from a great public scandal,” said the banker, rising. “sir, i cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it. and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologize to him for the wrong which i have done him. as to what you tell me of poor mary, it goes to my very heart. not even your skill can inform me where she is now.” “i think that we may safely say,” returned holmes, “that she is wherever sir george burnwell is. it is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.” adventure xii the adventure of the copper beeches “to the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked sherlock holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _the daily telegraph_, “it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. it is pleasant to me to observe, watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, i am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in which i have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province.” “and yet,” said i, smiling, “i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.” “you have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.” “it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter,” i remarked, with some coldness, for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character. “no, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “if i claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. crime is common. logic is rare. therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.” it was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street. a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings. “at the same time,” he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. the small matter in which i endeavored to help the king of bohemia, the singular experience of miss mary sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. but in avoiding the sensational, i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.” “the end may have been so,” i answered, “but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest.” “pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! but, indeed, if you are trivial, i cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. as to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. i think that i have touched bottom at last, however. this note i had this morning marks my zero-point, i fancy. read it!” he tossed a crumpled letter across to me. it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus: “dear mr. holmes,—i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow, if i do not inconvenience you. “yours faithfully, violet hunter.” “do you know the young lady?” i asked. “not i.” “it is half-past ten now.” “yes, and i have no doubt that is her ring.” “it may turn out to be of more interest than you think. you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. it may be so in this case, also.” “well, let us hope so. but our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless i am much mistaken, is the person in question.” as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. she was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world. “you will excuse my troubling you, i am sure,” said she, as my companion rose to greet her; “but i have had a very strange experience, and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice, i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do.” “pray take a seat, miss hunter. i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you.” i could see that holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. he looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips together, to listen to her story. “i have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of colonel spence munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax, in nova scotia, and took his children over to america with him, so that i found myself without a situation. i advertised, and i answered advertisements, but without success. at last the little money which i had saved began to run short, and i was at my wits’ end as to what i should do. “there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end called westaway’s, and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by miss stoper. she sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything which would suit them. “well, when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual, but i found that miss stoper was not alone. a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to miss stoper: “‘that will do,’ said he; ‘i could not ask for anything better. capital! capital!’ he seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. he was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him. “‘you are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked. “‘yes, sir.’ “‘as governess?’ “‘yes, sir.’ “‘and what salary do you ask?’ “‘i had £4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro.’ “‘oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘how could any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’ “‘my accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said i. ‘a little french, a little german, music, and drawing—’ “‘tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘this is all quite beside the question. the point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? there it is in a nutshell. if you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. but if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? your salary with me, madam, would commence at £100 a year.’ “you may imagine, mr. holmes, that to me, destitute as i was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. the gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note. “‘it is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’ “it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. as i was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself. “‘may i ask where you live, sir?’ said i. “‘hampshire. charming rural place. the copper beeches, five miles on the far side of winchester. it is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’ “‘and my duties, sir? i should be glad to know what they would be.’ “‘one child—one dear little romper just six years old. oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! smack! smack! smack! three gone before you could wink!’ he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again. “i was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking. “‘my sole duties, then,’ i asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’ “‘no, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried. ‘your duty would be, as i am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. you see no difficulty, heh?’ “‘i should be happy to make myself useful.’ “‘quite so. in dress now, for example. we are faddy people, you know—faddy but kind-hearted. if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. heh?’ “‘no,’ said i, considerably astonished at his words. “‘or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’ “‘oh, no.’ “‘or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’ “i could hardly believe my ears. as you may observe, mr. holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. it has been considered artistic. i could not dream of sacrificing it in this off-hand fashion. “‘i am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said i. he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke. “‘i am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘it is a little fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’ fancies must be consulted. and so you won’t cut your hair?’ “‘no, sir, i really could not,’ i answered, firmly. “‘ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. it is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. in that case, miss stoper, i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.’ “the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal. “‘do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked. “‘if you please, miss stoper.’ “‘well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she, sharply. ‘you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. good-day to you, miss hunter.’ she struck a gong upon the table, and i was shown out by the page. “well, mr. holmes, when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing. after all, if these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. very few governesses in england are getting £100 a year. besides, what use was my hair to me? many people are improved by wearing it short, and perhaps i should be among the number. next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake, and by the day after i was sure of it. i had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when i received this letter from the gentleman himself. i have it here, and i will read it to you: “‘the copper beeches, near winchester. “‘dear miss hunter,—miss stoper has very kindly given me your address, and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. my wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. we are willing to give £30 a quarter, or £120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. they are not very exacting, after all. my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning. you need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice (now in philadelphia), which would, i should think, fit you very well. then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. as regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point, and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. now do try to come, and i shall meet you with the dog-cart at winchester. let me know your train. yours faithfully, jephro rucastle.’ “that is the letter which i have just received, mr. holmes, and my mind is made up that i will accept it. i thought, however, that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.” “well, miss hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,” said holmes, smiling. “but you would not advise me to refuse?” “i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for.” “what is the meaning of it all, mr. holmes?” “ah, i have no data. i cannot tell. perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?” “well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. mr. rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak.” “that is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.” “but the money, mr. holmes, the money!” “well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. that is what makes me uneasy. why should they give you £120 a year, when they could have their pick for £40? there must be some strong reason behind.” “i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help. i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me.” “oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. there is something distinctly novel about some of the features. if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—” “danger! what danger do you foresee?” holmes shook his head gravely. “it would cease to be a danger if we could define it,” said he. “but at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.” “that is enough.” she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. “i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now. i shall write to mr. rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for winchester to-morrow.” with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way. “at least,” said i, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.” “and she would need to be,” said holmes, gravely; “i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.” it was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. a fortnight went by, during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. the unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. as to holmes, i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it. “data! data! data!” he cried, impatiently. “i can’t make bricks without clay.” and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation. the telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as i was thinking of turning in, and holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night, and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning. he opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me. “just look up the trains in bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his chemical studies. the summons was a brief and urgent one. “please be at the ‘black swan’ hotel at winchester at mid-day to-morrow,” it said. “do come! i am at my wits’ end. hunter.” “will you come with me?” asked holmes, glancing up. “i should wish to.” “just look it up, then.” “there is a train at half-past nine,” said i, glancing over my bradshaw. “it is due at winchester at 11.30.” “that will do very nicely. then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.” * * * * * by eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital. holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down, and began to admire the scenery. it was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. the sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy. all over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around aldershot, the little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage. “are they not fresh and beautiful?” i cried, with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street. but holmes shook his head gravely. “do you know, watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. you look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. i look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.” “good heavens!” i cried. “who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?” “they always fill me with a certain horror. it is my belief, watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful country-side.” “you horrify me!” “but the reason is very obvious. the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. but look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester, i should never have had a fear for her. it is the five miles of country which makes the danger. still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.” “no. if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away.” “quite so. she has her freedom.” “what _can_ be the matter, then? can you suggest no explanation?” “i have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell.” the “black swan” is an inn of repute in the high street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. she had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table. “i am so delighted that you have come,” she said, earnestly. “it is so very kind of you both; but indeed i do not know what i should do. your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.” “pray tell us what has happened to you.” “i will do so, and i must be quick, for i have promised mr. rucastle to be back before three. i got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.” “let us have everything in its due order.” holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen. “in the first place, i may say that i have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from mr. and mrs. rucastle. it is only fair to them to say that. but i cannot understand them, and i am not easy in my mind about them.” “what can you not understand?” “their reasons for their conduct. but you shall have it all just as it occurred. when i came down, mr. rucastle met me here, and drove me in his dog-cart to the copper beeches. it is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. there are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high-road, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. this ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of lord southerton’s preserves. a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place. [illustration: “‘i am so delighted that you have come’”] “i was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. there was no truth, mr. holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street. mrs. rucastle is not mad. i found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, i should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia. mr. rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother. as the daughter could not have been less than twenty, i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife. “mrs. rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in feature. she impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. she was a nonentity. it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. her light gray eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. he was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. and yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. she would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. more than once i have surprised her in tears. i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for i have never met so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. he is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. but i would rather not talk about the creature, mr. holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.” “i am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.” “i shall try not to miss anything of importance. the one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. there are only two, a man and his wife. toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet mr. rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as mrs. rucastle, and much less amiable. they are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building. “for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, mrs. rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband. “‘oh yes,’ said he, turning to me; ‘we are very much obliged to you, miss hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. we shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’ “the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. it was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it. both mr. and mrs. rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. they were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. a chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. in this i was asked to sit, and then mr. rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to. you cannot imagine how comical he was, and i laughed until i was quite weary. mrs. rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. after an hour or so, mr. rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery. “two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. again i changed my dress, again i sat in the window, and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably. then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. i read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress. “you can easily imagine, mr. holmes, how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. they were always very careful, i observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. at first it seemed to be impossible, but i soon devised a means. my hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. on the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, i put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. i confess that i was disappointed. there was nothing. at least that was my first impression. at the second glance, however, i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. the road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. this man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs. rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. she said nothing, but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what was behind me. she rose at once. “‘jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter.’ “‘no friend of yours, miss hunter?’ he asked. “‘no; i know no one in these parts.’ “‘dear me! how very impertinent! kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.’ “‘surely it would be better to take no notice.’ “‘no, no, we should have him loitering here always. kindly turn round and wave him away like that.’ “i did as i was told, and at the same instant mrs. rucastle drew down the blind. that was a week ago, and from that time i have not sat again in the window, nor have i worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.” “pray continue,” said holmes. “your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.” “you will find it rather disconnected, i fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak. on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches, mr. rucastle took me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door. as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about. “‘look in here!’ said mr. rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. ‘is he not a beauty?’ “i looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness. “‘don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which i had given. ‘it’s only carlo, my mastiff. i call him mine, but really old toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. we feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. toller lets him loose every night, and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. for goodness’ sake don’t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it is as much as your life is worth.’ “the warning was no idle one, for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. it was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. i was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was. it was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. that dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done. “and now i have a very strange experience to tell you. i had, as you know, cut off my hair in london, and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. one evening, after the child was in bed, i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. there was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. i had filled the first two with my linen, and, as i had still much to pack away, i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. the very first key fitted to perfection, and i drew the drawer open. there was only one thing in it, but i am sure that you would never guess what it was. it was my coil of hair. “i took it up and examined it. it was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. how _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer? with trembling hands i undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. i laid the two tresses together, and i assure you that they were identical. was it not extraordinary? puzzle as i would, i could make nothing at all of what it meant. i returned the strange hair to the drawer, and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles, as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked. “i am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, mr. holmes, and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. there was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. one day, however, as i ascended the stair, i met mr. rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom i was accustomed. his cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look. “this aroused my curiosity; so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house. there were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. they were evidently all deserted. as i strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, mr. rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever. “‘ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word, my dear young lady. i was preoccupied with business matters.’ “i assured him that i was not offended. ‘by-the-way,’ said i, ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.’ “he looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark. “‘photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘i have made my dark room up there. but, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. who would have believed it? who would have ever believed it?’ he spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. i read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest. “well, mr. holmes, from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know, i was all on fire to go over them. it was not mere curiosity, though i have my share of that. it was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. they talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. at any rate, it was there, and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door. “it was only yesterday that the chance came. i may tell you that, besides mr. rucastle, both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when i came up-stairs, there was the key in the door. i have no doubt at all that he had left it there. mr. and mrs. rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was with them, so that i had an admirable opportunity. i turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through. “there was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. they each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. the centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. the door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil, i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. a mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, mr. holmes. my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and i turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. i rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of mr. rucastle, who was waiting outside. “‘so,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. i thought that it must be when i saw the door open.’ “‘oh, i am so frightened!’ i panted. “‘my dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?’ “but his voice was just a little too coaxing. he overdid it. i was keenly on my guard against him. “‘i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ i answered. ‘but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again. oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’ “‘only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly. “‘why, what did you think?’ i asked. “‘why do you think that i lock this door?’ “‘i am sure that i do not know.’ “‘it is to keep people out who have no business there. do you see?’ he was still smiling in the most amiable manner. “‘i am sure if i had known—’ “‘well, then, you know now. and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again—’ here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘i’ll throw you to the mastiff.’ “i was so terrified that i do not know what i did. i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room. i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. then i thought of you, mr. holmes. i could not live there longer without some advice. i was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. they were all horrible to me. if i could only bring you down all would be well. of course i might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. my mind was soon made up. i would send you a wire. i put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. i slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning, but i must be back before three o’clock, for mr. and mrs. rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that i must look after the child. now i have told you all my adventures, mr. holmes, and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what i should do.” holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. my friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face. “is toller still drunk?” he asked. “yes. i heard his wife tell mrs. rucastle that she could do nothing with him.” “that is well. and the rucastles go out to-night?” “yes.” “is there a cellar with a good strong lock?” “yes, the wine-cellar.” “you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, miss hunter. do you think that you could perform one more feat? i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman.” “i will try. what is it?” “we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and i. the rucastles will be gone by that time, and toller will, we hope, be incapable. there only remains mrs. toller, who might give the alarm. if you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.” “i will do it.” “excellent! we shall then look thoroughly into the affair. of course there is only one feasible explanation. you have been brought there to personate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. that is obvious. as to who this prisoner is, i have no doubt that it is the daughter, miss alice rucastle, if i remember right, who was said to have gone to america. you were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the color of your hair. hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. by a curious chance you came upon her tresses. the man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that miss rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate with her. so much is fairly clear. the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.” “what on earth has that to do with it?” i ejaculated. “my dear watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. don’t you see that the converse is equally valid. i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. this child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as i should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.” “i am sure that you are right, mr. holmes,” cried our client. “a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.” “we must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. we can do nothing until seven o’clock. at that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.” we were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. the group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step. “have you managed it?” asked holmes. a loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. “that is mrs. toller in the cellar,” said she. “her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. here are his keys, which are the duplicates of mr. rucastle’s.” “you have done well indeed!” cried holmes, with enthusiasm. “now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.” we passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described. holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. no sound came from within, and at the silence holmes’s face clouded over. “i trust that we are not too late,” said he. “i think, miss hunter, that we had better go in without you. now, watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.” it was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united strength. together we rushed into the room. it was empty. there was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. the skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone. “there has been some villainy here,” said holmes; “this beauty has guessed miss hunter’s intentions, and has carried his victim off.” “but how?” “through the skylight. we shall soon see how he managed it.” he swung himself up onto the roof. “ah, yes,” he cried; “here’s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. that is how he did it.” “but it is impossible,” said miss hunter; “the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away.” “he has come back and done it. i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair. i think, watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.” the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him. “you villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?” the fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight. “it is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! spies and thieves! i have caught you, have i? you are in my power. i’ll serve you!” he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go. “he’s gone for the dog!” cried miss hunter. “i have my revolver,” said i. “better close the front door,” cried holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door. “my god!” he cried. “some one has loosed the dog. it’s not been fed for two days. quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!” holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house, with toller hurrying behind us. there was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. running up, i blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. with much labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and, having despatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife, i did what i could to relieve his pain. we were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room. “mrs. toller!” cried miss hunter. “yes, miss. mr. rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were planning, for i would have told you that your pains were wasted.” “ha!” said holmes, looking keenly at her. “it is clear that mrs. toller knows more about this matter than any one else.” “yes, sir, i do, and i am ready enough to tell what i know.” “then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark.” “i will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and i’d have done so before now if i could ha’ got out from the cellar. if there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that i was the one that stood your friend, and that i was miss alice’s friend too. “she was never happy at home, miss alice wasn’t, from the time that her father married again. she was slighted like, and had no say in anything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr. fowler at a friend’s house. as well as i could learn, miss alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in mr. rucastle’s hands. he knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. when she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.” “ah,” said holmes, “i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that i can deduce all that remains. mr. rucastle then, i presume, took to this system of imprisonment?” “yes, sir.” “and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr. fowler.” “that was it, sir.” “but mr. fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.” “mr. fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said mrs. toller, serenely. “and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.” “you have it, sir, just as it happened.” “i am sure we owe you an apology, mrs. toller,” said holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. and here comes the country surgeon and mrs. rucastle, so i think, watson, that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester, as it seems to me that our _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.” and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. mr. rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. they still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. mr. fowler and miss rucastle were married, by special license, in southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius. as to miss violet hunter, my friend holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at walsall, where i believe that she has met with considerable success. the end
﻿ chapter i early recollections extraction--“h. b.”--four remarkable brothers--my mother’s family tree--an unrecognized genius--my first knockout--thackeray--the fenians--early reading--my first story. i was born on may 22, 1859, at picardy place, edinburgh, so named because in old days a colony of french huguenots had settled there. at the time of their coming it was a village outside the city walls, but now it is at the end of queen street, abutting upon leith walk. when last i visited it, it seemed to have degenerated, but at that time the flats were of good repute. my father was the youngest son of john doyle, who under the _nom de crayon_ of “h. b.” made a great reputation in london from about 1825 to 1850. he came from dublin about the year 1815 and may be said to be the father of polite caricature, for in the old days satire took the brutal shape of making the object grotesque in features and figure. gilray and rowlandson had no other idea. my grandfather was a gentleman, drawing gentlemen for gentlemen, and the satire lay in the wit of the picture and not in the misdrawing of faces. this was a new idea, but it has been followed by most caricaturists since and so has become familiar. there were no comic papers in those days, and the weekly cartoon of “h. b.” was lithographed and distributed. he exerted, i am told, quite an influence upon politics, and was on terms of intimacy with many of the leading men of the day. i can remember him in his old age, a very handsome and dignified man with features of the strong anglo-irish, duke of wellington stamp. he died in 1868. my grandfather was left a widower with a numerous family, of which four boys and one girl survived. each of the boys made a name for himself, for all inherited the artistic powers of their father. the elder, james doyle, wrote “the chronicles of england,” illustrated with coloured pictures by himself--examples of colour-printing which beat any subsequent work that i have ever seen. he also spent thirteen years in doing “the official baronage of england,” a wonderful monument of industry and learning. another brother was henry doyle, a great judge of old paintings, and in later years the manager of the national gallery in dublin, where he earned his c.b. the third son was richard doyle, whose whimsical humour made him famous in “punch,” the cover of which with its dancing elves is still so familiar an object. finally came charles doyle, my father. the doyle family seem to have been fairly well-to-do, thanks to my grandfather’s talents. they lived in london in cambridge terrace. a sketch of their family life is given in “dicky doyle’s diary.” they lived up to their income, however, and it became necessary to find places for the boys. when my father was only nineteen a seat was offered him in the government office of works in edinburgh, whither he went. there he spent his working life, and thus it came about that i, an irishman by extraction, was born in the scottish capital. the doyles, anglo-norman in origin, were strong roman catholics. the original doyle, or d’oil, was a cadet-branch of the staffordshire doyles, which has produced sir francis hastings doyle and many other distinguished men. this cadet shared in the invasion of ireland and was granted estates in county wexford, where a great clan rose of dependants, illegitimate children and others, all taking the feudal lord’s name, just as the de burghs founded the clan of burke. we can only claim to be the main stem by virtue of community of character and appearance with the english doyles and the unbroken use of the same crest and coat-of-arms. my forbears, like most old irish families in the south, kept to the old faith at the reformation and fell victims to the penal laws in consequence. these became so crushing upon landed gentry that my great-grandfather was driven from his estate and became a silk-mercer in dublin, where “h. b.” was born. this family record was curiously confirmed by monsignor barry doyle, destined, i think, for the highest honours of the roman church, who traces back to the younger brother of my great-grandfather. i trust the reader will indulge me in my excursion into these family matters, which are of vital interest to the family, but must be tedious to the outsider. as i am on the subject, i wish to say a word upon my mother’s family, the more so as she was great on archaeology, and had, with the help of sir arthur vicars, ulster king of arms, and himself a relative, worked out her descent for more than five hundred years, and so composed a family tree which lies before me as i write and on which many of the great ones of the earth have roosted. her father was a young doctor of trinity college, william foley, who died young and left his family in comparative poverty. he had married one katherine pack, whose death-bed--or rather the white waxen thing which lay upon that bed--is the very earliest recollection of my life. her near relative--uncle, i think--was sir denis pack, who led the scottish brigade at waterloo. the packs were a fighting family, as was but right since they were descended in a straight line from a major in cromwell’s army who settled in ireland. one of them, anthony pack, had part of his head carried off at the same battle, so i fear it is part of our family tradition that we lose our heads in action. his brain was covered over by a silver plate and he lived for many years, subject only to very bad fits of temper, which some of us have had with less excuse. but the real romance of the family lies in the fact that about the middle of the seventeenth century the reverend richard pack, who was head of kilkenny college, married mary percy, who was heir to the irish branch of the percys of northumberland. by this alliance we all connect up (and i have every generation by name, as marked out by my dear mother) with that illustrious line up to three separate marriages with the plantagenets. one has, therefore, some strange strains in one’s blood which are noble in origin and, one can but hope, are noble in tendency. but all this romance of ancestry did not interfere with the fact that when katherine pack, the irish gentlewoman, came in her widowhood to edinburgh, she was very poor. i have never been clear why it was edinburgh for which she made. having taken a flat she let it be known that a paying-guest would be welcome. just at this time, 1850 or thereabouts, charles doyle was sent from london with a recommendation to the priests that they should guard his young morals and budding faith. how could they do this better than by finding him quarters with a well-born and orthodox widow? thus it came about that two separate lines of irish wanderers came together under one roof. i have a little bundle of my father’s letters written in those days, full of appreciation of the kindness which he met with and full, also, of interesting observations on that scottish society, rough, hard-drinking and kindly, into which he had been precipitated at a dangerously early age, especially for one with his artistic temperament. he had some fine religious instincts, but his environment was a difficult one. in the household was a bright-eyed, very intelligent younger daughter, mary, who presently went off to france and returned as a very cultivated young woman. the romance is easily understood, and so charles doyle in the year 1855 married mary foley, my mother, the young couple still residing with my grandmother. their means were limited, for his salary as a civil servant was not more than about £240. this he supplemented by his drawings. thus matters remained for practically all his life, for he was quite unambitious and no great promotion ever came his way. his painting was done spasmodically and the family did not always reap the benefit, for edinburgh is full of water-colours which he had given away. it is one of my unfulfilled schemes to collect as many as possible and to have a charles doyle exhibition in london, for the critics would be surprised to find what a great and original artist he was--far the greatest, in my opinion, of the family. his brush was concerned not only with fairies and delicate themes of the kind, but with wild and fearsome subjects, so that his work had a very peculiar style of its own, mitigated by great natural humour. he was more terrible than blake and less morbid than wiertz. his originality is best shown by the fact that one hardly knows with whom to compare him. in prosaic scotland, however, he excited wonder rather than admiration, and he was only known in the larger world of london by pen and ink book-illustrations which were not his best mode of expression. the prosaic outcome was that including all his earnings my mother could never have averaged more than £300 a year on which to educate a large family. we lived in the hardy and bracing atmosphere of poverty and we each in turn did our best to help those who were younger than ourselves. my noble sister annette, who died just as the sunshine of better days came into our lives, went out at a very early age as a governess to portugal and sent all her salary home. my younger sisters, lottie and connie, both did the same thing; and i helped as i could. but it was still my dear mother who bore the long, sordid strain. often i said to her, “when you are old, mammie, you shall have a velvet dress and gold glasses and sit in comfort by the fire.” thank god, it so came to pass. my father, i fear, was of little help to her, for his thoughts were always in the clouds and he had no appreciation of the realities of life. the world, not the family, gets the fruits of genius. of my boyhood i need say little, save that it was spartan at home and more spartan at the edinburgh school where a tawse-brandishing schoolmaster of the old type made our young lives miserable. from the age of seven to nine i suffered under this pock-marked, one-eyed rascal who might have stepped from the pages of dickens. in the evenings home and books were my sole consolation, save for week-end holidays. my comrades were rough boys and i became a rough boy, too. if there is any truth in the idea of reincarnation--a point on which my mind is still open--i think some earlier experience of mine must have been as a stark fighter, for it came out strongly in youth, when i rejoiced in battle. we lived for some time in a _cul de sac_ street with a very vivid life of its own and a fierce feud between the small boys who dwelt on either side of it. finally it was fought out between two champions, i representing the poorer boys who lived in flats and my opponent the richer boys who lived in the opposite villas. we fought in the garden of one of the said villas and had an excellent contest of many rounds, not being strong enough to weaken each other. when i got home after the battle, my mother cried, “oh, arthur, what a dreadful eye you have got!” to which i replied, “you just go across and look at eddie tulloch’s eye!” i met a well-deserved setback on one occasion when i stood forward to fight a bootmaker’s boy, who had come into our preserve upon an errand. he had a green baize bag in his hand which contained a heavy boot, and this he swung against my skull with a force which knocked me pretty well senseless. it was a useful lesson. i will say for myself, however, that though i was pugnacious i was never so to those weaker than myself and that some of my escapades were in the defence of such. as i will show in my chapter on sport, i carried on my tastes into a later period of my life. one or two little pictures stand out which may be worth recording. when my grandfather’s grand london friends passed through edinburgh they used, to our occasional embarrassment, to call at the little flat “to see how charles is getting on.” in my earliest childhood such a one came, tall, white-haired and affable. i was so young that it seems like a faint dream, and yet it pleases me to think that i have sat on thackeray’s knee. he greatly admired my dear little mother with her grey irish eyes and her vivacious celtic ways--indeed, no one met her without being captivated by her. once, too, i got a glimpse of history. it was in 1866, if my dates are right, that some well-to-do irish relatives asked us over for a few weeks, and we passed that time in a great house in king’s county. i spent much of it with the horses and dogs, and became friendly with the young groom. the stables opened on to a country road by an arched gate with a loft over it. one morning, being in the yard, i saw the young groom rush into the yard with every sign of fear and hastily shut and bar the doors. he then climbed into the loft, beckoning to me to come with him. from the loft window we saw a gang of rough men, twenty or so, slouching along the road. when they came opposite to the gate they stopped and looking up shook their fists and cursed at us. the groom answered back most volubly. afterwards i understood that these men were a party of fenians, and that i had had a glimpse of one of the periodical troubles which poor old ireland has endured. perhaps now, at last, they may be drawing to an end. during these first ten years i was a rapid reader, so rapid that some small library with which we dealt gave my mother notice that books would not be changed more than twice a day. my tastes were boylike enough, for mayne reid was my favourite author, and his “scalp hunters” my favourite book. i wrote a little book and illustrated it myself in early days. there was a man in it and there was a tiger who amalgamated shortly after they met. i remarked to my mother with precocious wisdom that it was easy to get people into scrapes, but not so easy to get them out again, which is surely the experience of every writer of adventures. chapter ii under the jesuits the preparatory school--the mistakes of education--spartan schooling--corporal punishment--well-known school fellows--gloomy forecasts--poetry--london matriculation--german school--a happy year--the jesuits--strange arrival in paris. i was in my tenth year when i was sent to hodder, which is the preparatory school for stonyhurst, the big roman catholic public school in lancashire. it was a long journey for a little boy who had never been away from home before, and i felt very lonesome and wept bitterly upon the way, but in due time i arrived safely at preston, which was then the nearest station, and with many other small boys and our black-robed jesuit guardians we drove some twelve miles to the school. hodder is about a mile from stonyhurst, and as all the boys there are youngsters under twelve, it forms a very useful institution, breaking a lad into school ways before he mixes with the big fellows. i had two years at hodder. the year was not broken up by the frequent holidays which illuminate the present educational period. save for six weeks each summer, one never left the school. on the whole, those first two years were happy years. i could hold my own both in brain and in strength with my comrades. i was fortunate enough to get under the care of a kindly principal, one father cassidy, who was more human than jesuits usually are. i have always kept a warm remembrance of this man and of his gentle ways to the little boys--young rascals many of us--who were committed to his care. i remember the franco-german war breaking out at this period, and how it made a ripple even in our secluded back-water. from hodder i passed on to stonyhurst, that grand mediæval dwelling-house which was left some hundred and fifty years ago to the jesuits, who brought over their whole teaching staff from some college in holland in order to carry it on as a public school. the general curriculum, like the building, was mediæval but sound. i understand it has been modernized since. there were seven classes--elements, figures, rudiments, grammar, syntax, poetry and rhetoric--and you were allotted a year for each, or seven in all--a course with which i faithfully complied, two having already been completed at hodder. it was the usual public school routine of euclid, algebra and the classics, taught in the usual way, which is calculated to leave a lasting abhorrence of these subjects. to give boys a little slab of virgil or homer with no general idea as to what it is all about or what the classical age was like, is surely an absurd way of treating the subject. i am sure that an intelligent boy could learn more by reading a good translation of homer for a week than by a year’s study of the original as it is usually carried out. it was no worse at stonyhurst than at any other school, and it can only be excused on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental dumb-bell by which one can improve one’s mind. it is, i think, a thoroughly false theory. i can say with truth that my latin and greek, which cost me so many weary hours, have been little use to me in life, and that my mathematics have been no use at all. on the other hand, some things which i picked up almost by accident, the art of reading aloud, learned when my mother was knitting, or the reading of french books, learned by spelling out the captions of the jules verne illustrations, have been of the greatest possible service. my classical education left me with a horror of the classics, and i was astonished to find how fascinating they were when i read them in a reasonable manner in later years. year by year, then, i see myself climbing those seven weary steps and passing through as many stages of my boyhood. i do not know if the jesuit system of education is good or not; i would need to have tried another system as well before i could answer that. on the whole it was justified by results, for i think it turned out as decent a set of young fellows as any other school would do. in spite of a large infusion of foreigners and some disaffected irish, we were a patriotic crowd, and our little pulse beat time with the heart of the nation. i am told that the average of v.c.’s and d.s.o.’s now held by old stonyhurst boys is very high as compared with other schools. the jesuit teachers have no trust in human nature, and perhaps they are justified. we were never allowed for an instant to be alone with each other, and i think that the immorality which is rife in public schools was at a minimum in consequence. in our games and our walks the priests always took part, and a master perambulated the dormitories at night. such a system may weaken self-respect and self-help, but it at least minimizes temptation and scandal. the life was spartan, and yet we had all that was needed. dry bread and hot well-watered milk were our frugal breakfast. there was a “joint” and twice a week a pudding for dinner. then there was an odd snack called “bread and beer” in the afternoon, a bit of dry bread and the most extraordinary drink, which was brown but had no other characteristic of beer. finally, there was hot milk again, bread, butter, and often potatoes for supper. we were all very healthy on this _régime_, on fridays. everything in every way was plain to the verge of austerity, save that we dwelt in a beautiful building, dined in a marble-floored hall with minstrels’ gallery, prayed in a lovely church, and generally lived in very choice surroundings so far as vision and not comfort was concerned. corporal punishment was severe, and i can speak with feeling as i think few, if any, boys of my time endured more of it. it was of a peculiar nature, imported also, i fancy, from holland. the instrument was a piece of india-rubber of the size and shape of a thick boot sole. this was called a “tolley”--why, no one has explained, unless it is a latin pun on what we had to bear. one blow of this instrument, delivered with intent, would cause the palm of the hand to swell up and change colour. when i say that the usual punishment of the larger boys was nine on each hand, and that nine on one hand was the absolute minimum, it will be understood that it was a severe ordeal, and that the sufferer could not, as a rule, turn the handle of the door to get out of the room in which he had suffered. to take twice nine upon a cold day was about the extremity of human endurance. i think, however, that it was good for us in the end, for it was a point of honour with many of us not to show that we were hurt, and that is one of the best trainings for a hard life. if i was more beaten than others it was not that i was in any way vicious, but it was that i had a nature which responded eagerly to affectionate kindness (which i never received), but which rebelled against threats and took a perverted pride in showing that it would not be cowed by violence. i went out of my way to do really mischievous and outrageous things simply to show that my spirit was unbroken. an appeal to my better nature and not to my fears would have found an answer at once. i deserved all i got for what i did, but i did it because i was mishandled. i do not remember any one who attained particular distinction among my school-fellows, save bernard partridge of “punch,” whom i recollect as a very quiet, gentle boy. father thurston, who was destined to be one of my opponents in psychic matters so many years later, was in the class above me. there was a young novice, too, with whom i hardly came in contact, but whose handsome and spiritual appearance i well remember. he was bernard vaughan, afterwards the famous preacher. save for one school-fellow, james ryan--a remarkable boy who grew into a remarkable man--i carried away no lasting friendship from stonyhurst. it was only in the latest stage of my stonyhurst development that i realized that i had some literary streak in me which was not common to all. it came to me as quite a surprise, and even more perhaps to my masters, who had taken a rather hopeless view of my future prospects. one master, when i told him that i thought of being a civil engineer, remarked, “well, doyle, you may be an engineer, but i don’t think you will ever be a civil one.” another assured me that i would never do any good in the world, and perhaps from his point of view his prophecy has been justified. the particular incident, however, which brought my latent powers to the surface depended upon the fact that in the second highest class, which i reached in 1874, it was incumbent to write poetry (so called) on any theme given. this was done as a dreary unnatural task by most boys. very comical their wooings of the muses used to be. for one saturated as i really was with affection for verse, it was a labour of love, and i produced verses which were poor enough in themselves but seemed miracles to those who had no urge in that direction. the particular theme was the crossing of the red sea by the israelites and my effort from-- “like pallid daisies in a grassy wood, so round the sward the tents of israel stood”; through-- “there was no time for thought and none for fear, for egypt’s horse already pressed their rear.” down to the climax-- “one horrid cry! the tragedy was o’er, and pharaoh with his army seen no more,”-- was workmanlike though wooden and conventional. anyhow, it marked what mr. stead used to call a signpost, and i realized myself a little. in the last year i edited the college magazine and wrote a good deal of indifferent verse. i also went up for the matriculation examination of london university, a good all-round test which winds up the stonyhurst curriculum, and i surprised every one by taking honours, so after all i emerged from stonyhurst at the age of sixteen with more credit than seemed probable from my rather questionable record. early in my career there, an offer had been made to my mother that my school fees would be remitted if i were dedicated to the church. she refused this, so both the church and i had an escape. when i think, however, of her small income and great struggle to keep up appearances and make both ends meet, it was a fine example of her independence of character, for it meant paying out some £50 a year which might have been avoided by a word of assent. [illustration: my mother, at 17. _drawn by richard doyle, july 1854._] i had yet another year with the jesuits, for it was determined that i was still too young to begin any professional studies, and that i should go to germany and learn german. i was despatched, therefore, to feldkirch, which is a jesuit school in the vorarlberg province of austria, to which many better-class german boys are sent. here the conditions were much more humane and i met with far more human kindness than at stonyhurst, with the immediate result that i ceased to be a resentful young rebel and became a pillar of law and order. i began badly, however, for on the first night of my arrival i was kept awake by a boy snoring loudly in the dormitory. i stood it as long as i could, but at last i was driven to action. curious wooden compasses called _bett-scheere_, or “bed-scissors,” were stuck into each side of the narrow beds. one of these i plucked out, walked down the dormitory, and, having spotted the offender, proceeded to poke him with my stick. he awoke and was considerably amazed to see in the dim light a large youth whom he had never seen before--i arrived after hours--assaulting him with a club. i was still engaged in stirring him up when i felt a touch on my shoulder and was confronted by the master, who ordered me back to bed. next morning i got a lecture on free-and-easy english ways, and taking the law into my own hands. but this start was really my worst lapse and i did well in the future. it was a happy year on the whole. i made less progress with german than i should, for there were about twenty english and irish boys who naturally balked the wishes of their parents by herding together. there was no cricket, but there were toboganning and fair football and a weird game--football on stilts. then there were the lovely mountains round us, with an occasional walk among them. the food was better than at stonyhurst and we had the pleasant german light beer instead of the horrible swipes of stonyhurst. one unlooked-for accomplishment i acquired, for the boy who played the big brass bass instrument in the fine school band had not returned, and, as a well-grown lad was needed, i was at once enlisted in the service. i played in public--good music, too, “lohengrin,” and “tannhäuser,”--within a week or two of my first lesson, but they pressed me on for the occasion and the bombardon, as it was called, only comes in on a measured rhythm with an occasional run, which sounds like a hippopotamus doing a step-dance. so big was the instrument that i remember the other bandsmen putting my sheets and blankets inside it and my surprise when i could not get out a note. it was in the summer of 1876 that i left feldkirch, and i have always had a pleasant memory of the austrian jesuits and of the old schools. indeed i have a kindly feeling towards all jesuits, far as i have strayed from their paths. i see now both their limitations and their virtues. they have been slandered in some things, for during eight years of constant contact i cannot remember that they were less truthful than their fellows, or more casuistical than their neighbours. they were keen, clean-minded earnest men, so far as i knew them, with a few black sheep among them, but not many, for the process of selection was careful and long. in all ways, save in their theology, they were admirable, though this same theology made them hard and inhuman upon the surface, which is indeed the general effect of catholicism in its more extreme forms. the convert is lost to the family. their hard, narrow outlook gives the jesuits driving power, as is noticeable in the puritans and all hard, narrow creeds. they are devoted and fearless and have again and again, both in canada, in south america and in china, been the vanguard of civilization to their own grievous hurt. they are the old guard of the roman church. but the tragedy is that they, who would gladly give their lives for the old faith, have in effect helped to ruin it, for it is they, according to father tyrrell and the modernists, who have been at the back of all those extreme doctrines of papal infallibility and immaculate conception, with a general all-round tightening of dogma, which have made it so difficult for the man with scientific desire for truth or with intellectual self-respect to keep within the church. for some years sir charles mivart, the last of catholic scientists, tried to do the impossible, and then he also had to leave go his hold, so that there is not, so far as i know, one single man of outstanding fame in science or in general thought who is a practising catholic. this is the work of the extremists and is deplored by many of the moderates and fiercely condemned by the modernists. it depends also upon the inner italian directorate who give the orders. nothing can exceed the uncompromising bigotry of the jesuit theology, or their apparent ignorance of how it shocks the modern conscience. i remember that when, as a grown lad, i heard father murphy, a great fierce irish priest, declare that there was sure damnation for every one outside the church, i looked upon him with horror, and to that moment i trace the first rift which has grown into such a chasm between me and those who were my guides. on my way back to england i stopped at paris. through all my life up to this point there had been an unseen granduncle, named michael conan, to whom i must now devote a paragraph. he came into the family from the fact that my father’s father (“h. b.”) had married a miss conan. michael conan, her brother, had been editor of “the art journal” and was a man of distinction, an intellectual irishman of the type which originally founded the sinn fein movement. he was as keen on heraldry and genealogy as my mother, and he traced his descent in some circuitous way from the dukes of brittany, who were all conans; indeed arthur conan was the ill-fated young duke whose eyes were put out, according to shakespeare, by king john. this uncle was my godfather, and hence my name arthur conan. he lived in paris and had expressed a wish that his grandnephew and godson, with whom he had corresponded, should call _en passant_. i ran my money affairs so closely, after a rather lively supper at strasburg, that when i reached paris i had just twopence in my pocket. as i could not well drive up and ask my uncle to pay the cab i left my trunk at the station and set forth on foot. i reached the river, walked along it, came to the foot of the champs élysées, saw the arc de triomphe in the distance, and then, knowing that the avenue wagram, where my uncle lived, was near there, i tramped it on a hot august day and finally found him. i remember that i was exhausted with the heat and the walking, and that when at the last gasp i saw a man buy a drink of what seemed to be porter by handing a penny to a man who had a long tin on his back, i therefore halted the man and spent one of my pennies on a duplicate drink. it proved to be liquorice and water, but it revived me when i badly needed it, and it could not be said that i arrived penniless at my uncle’s, for i actually had a penny. so, for some penurious weeks, i was in paris with this dear old volcanic irishman, who spent the summer day in his shirt-sleeves, with a little dicky-bird of a wife waiting upon him. i am built rather on his lines of body and mind than on any of the doyles. we made a true friendship, and then i returned to my home conscious that real life was about to begin. chapter iii recollections of a student edinburgh university--a sad disappointment--original of professor challenger--of sherlock holmes--deductions--sheffield--ruyton-- birmingham--literary aspirations--first accepted story--my father’s death--mental position--spiritual yearnings--an awkward business. when i returned to edinburgh, with little to show, either mental or spiritual, for my pleasant school year in germany, i found that the family affairs were still as straitened as ever. no promotion had come to my father, and two younger children, innes, my only brother, and ida, had arrived to add to the calls upon my mother. another sister, julia, followed shortly afterwards. but annette, the eldest sister, had already gone out to portugal to earn and send home a fair salary, while lottie and connie were about to do the same. my mother had adopted the device of sharing a large house, which may have eased her in some ways, but was disastrous in others. perhaps it was good for me that the times were hard, for i was wild, full-blooded, and a trifle reckless, but the situation called for energy and application, so that one was bound to try to meet it. my mother had been so splendid that we could not fail her. it had been determined that i should be a doctor, chiefly, i think, because edinburgh was so famous a centre for medical learning. it meant another long effort for my mother, but she was very brave and ambitious where her children were concerned, and i was not only to have a medical education, but to take the university degree, which was a larger matter than a mere licence to practise. when i returned from germany i found that there was a long list of bursaries and scholarships open for competition. i had a month in which to brush up my classics and then i went in for these, and was informed a week later that i had won the grierson bursary of £40 for two years. great were the rejoicings and all shadows seemed to be lifting. but on calling to get the money i was informed that there had been a clerical error, and that this particular bursary was only open to arts students. as there was a long list of prizes i naturally supposed that i would get the next highest, which was available for medicals. the official pulled a long face and said: “unfortunately the candidate to whom it was allotted has already drawn the money.” it was manifest robbery, and yet i, who had won the prize and needed it so badly, never received it, and was eventually put off with a solatium of £7, which had accumulated from some fund. it was a bitter disappointment and, of course, i had a legal case, but what can a penniless student do, and what sort of college career would he have if he began it by suing his university for money? i was advised to accept the situation, and there seemed no prospect of accepting anything else. so now behold me, a tall strongly-framed but half-formed young man, fairly entered upon my five years’ course of medical study. it can be done with diligence in four years, but there came, as i shall show, a glorious interruption which held me back for one year. i entered as a student in october 1876, and i emerged as a bachelor of medicine in august 1881. between these two points lies one long weary grind at botany, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, and a whole list of compulsory subjects, many of which have a very indirect bearing upon the art of curing. the whole system of teaching, as i look back upon it, seems far too oblique and not nearly practical enough for the purpose in view. and yet edinburgh is, i believe, more practical than most other colleges. it is practical, too, in its preparation for life, since there is none of the atmosphere of an enlarged public school, as is the case in english universities, but the student lives a free man in his own rooms with no restrictions of any sort. it ruins some and makes strong men of many. in my own case, of course, this did not apply, since my family lived in the town, and i worked from my own home. there was no attempt at friendship, or even acquaintance, between professors and students at edinburgh. it was a strictly business arrangement by which you paid, for example, four guineas for anatomy lectures and received the winter course in exchange, never seeing your professor save behind his desk and never under any circumstances exchanging a word with him. they were remarkable men, however, some of these professors, and we managed to know them pretty well without any personal acquaintance. there was kindly crum brown, the chemist, who sheltered himself carefully before exploding some mixture, which usually failed to ignite, so that the loud “boom!” uttered by the class was the only resulting sound. brown would emerge from his retreat with a “really, gentlemen!” of remonstrance, and go on without allusion to the abortive experiment. there was wyville thomson, the zoologist, fresh from his _challenger_ expedition, and balfour, with the face and manner of john knox, a hard rugged old man, who harried the students in their exams, and was in consequence harried by them for the rest of the year. there was turner, a fine anatomist, but a self-educated man, as was betrayed when he used to “take and put this structure on the handle of this scalpel.” the most human trait that i can recall of turner was that upon one occasion the sacred quadrangle was invaded by snowballing roughs. his class, of whom i was one, heard the sounds of battle and fidgeted in their seats, on which the professor said: “i think, gentlemen, your presence may be more useful outside than here,” on which we flocked out with a whoop, and soon had the quadrangle clear. most vividly of all, however, there stands out in my memory the squat figure of professor rutherford with his assyrian beard, his prodigious voice, his enormous chest and his singular manner. he fascinated and awed us. i have endeavoured to reproduce some of his peculiarities in the fictitious character of professor challenger. he would sometimes start his lecture before he reached the classroom, so that we would hear a booming voice saying: “there are valves in the veins,” or some other information, when the desk was still empty. he was, i fear, a rather ruthless vivisector, and though i have always recognized that a minimum of painless vivisection is necessary, and far more justifiable than the eating of meat as a food, i am glad that the law was made more stringent so as to restrain such men as he. “ach, these jarman frags!” he would exclaim in his curious accent, as he tore some poor amphibian to pieces. i wrote a students’ song which is still sung, i understand, in which a curious article is picked up on the portobello beach and each professor in turn claims it for his department. rutherford’s verse ran: said rutherford with a smile, “it’s a mass of solid bile, and i myself obtained it, what is more, by a stringent cholagogue from a vivisected dog, and i lost it on the portobello shore.” if the song is indeed still sung it may be of interest to the present generation to know that i was the author. but the most notable of the characters whom i met was one joseph bell, surgeon at the edinburgh infirmary. bell was a very remarkable man in body and mind. he was thin, wiry, dark, with a high-nosed acute face, penetrating grey eyes, angular shoulders, and a jerky way of walking. his voice was high and discordant. he was a very skilful surgeon, but his strong point was diagnosis, not only of disease, but of occupation and character. for some reason which i have never understood he singled me out from the drove of students who frequented his wards and made me his out-patient clerk, which meant that i had to array his out-patients, make simple notes of their cases, and then show them in, one by one, to the large room in which bell sat in state surrounded by his dressers and students. then i had ample chance of studying his methods and of noticing that he often learned more of the patient by a few quick glances than i had done by my questions. occasionally the results were very dramatic, though there were times when he blundered. in one of his best cases he said to a civilian patient: “well, my man, you’ve served in the army.” “aye, sir.” “not long discharged?” “no, sir.” “a highland regiment?” “aye, sir.” “a non-com. officer.” “aye, sir.” “stationed at barbados?” “aye, sir.” “you see, gentlemen,” he would explain, “the man was a respectful man but did not remove his hat. they do not in the army, but he would have learned civilian ways had he been long discharged. he has an air of authority and he is obviously scottish. as to barbados, his complaint is elephantiasis, which is west indian and not british.” to his audience of watsons it all seemed very miraculous until it was explained, and then it became simple enough. it is no wonder that after the study of such a character i used and amplified his methods when in later life i tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal. bell took a keen interest in these detective tales and even made suggestions which were not, i am bound to say, very practical. i kept in touch with him for many years and he used to come upon my platform to support me when i contested edinburgh in 1901. when i took over his out-patient work he warned me that a knowledge of scottish idioms was necessary and i, with the confidence of youth, declared that i had got it. the sequel was amusing. on one of the first days an old man came who, in response to my question, declared that he had a “bealin’ in his oxter.” this fairly beat me, much to bell’s amusement. it seems that the words really mean an abscess in the arm-pit. speaking generally of my university career i may say that though i took my fences in my stride and balked at none of them, still i won no distinction in the race. i was always one of the ruck, neither lingering nor gaining--a 60 per cent man at examinations. there were, however, some reasons for this which i will now state. it was clearly very needful that i should help financially as quickly as possible, even if my help only took the humble form of providing for my own keep. therefore i endeavoured almost from the first to compress the classes for a year into half a year, and so to have some months in which to earn a little money as a medical assistant, who would dispense and do odd jobs for a doctor. when i first set forth to do this my services were so obviously worth nothing that i had to put that valuation upon them. even then it might have been a hard bargain for the doctor, for i might have proved like the youth in “pickwick” who had a rooted idea that oxalic acid was epsom salts. however, i had horse sense enough to save myself and my employer from any absolute catastrophe. my first venture, in the early summer of ’78, was with a dr. richardson, running a low-class practice in the poorer quarters of sheffield. i did my best, and i dare say he was patient, but at the end of three weeks we parted by mutual consent. i went on to london, where i renewed my advertisements in the medical papers, and found a refuge for some weeks with my doyle relatives, then living at clifton gardens, maida vale. i fear that i was too bohemian for them and they too conventional for me. however, they were kind to me, and i roamed about london for some time with pockets so empty that there was little chance of idleness breeding its usual mischief. i remember that there were signs of trouble in the east and that the recruiting sergeants, who were very busy in trafalgar square, took my measure in a moment and were very insistent that i should take the shilling. there was a time when i was quite disposed to do so, but my mother’s plans held me back. i may say that late in the same year i did volunteer as a dresser for the english ambulances sent to turkey for the russian war, and was on the red cross list, but the collapse of the turks prevented my going out. soon, however, there came an answer to my advertisement: “third year’s student, desiring experience rather than remuneration, offers his services, &c., &c.” it was from a dr. elliot living in a townlet in shropshire which rejoiced in the extraordinary name of “ruyton-of-the-eleven-towns.” it was not big enough to make one town, far less eleven. there for four months i helped in a country practice. it was a very quiet existence and i had a good deal of time to myself under very pleasant circumstances, so that i really trace some little mental progress to that period, for i read and thought without interruption. my medical duties were of a routine nature save on a few occasions. one of them still stands out in my memory, for it was the first time in my life that i ever had to test my own nerve in a great sudden emergency. the doctor was out when there came a half-crazed messenger to say that in some rejoicings at a neighbouring great house they had exploded an old cannon which had promptly burst and grievously injured one of the bystanders. no doctor was available, so i was the last resource. on arriving there i found a man in bed with a lump of iron sticking out of the side of his head. i tried not to show the alarm which i felt, and i did the obvious thing by pulling out the iron. i could see the clean white bone, so i could assure them that the brain had not been injured. i then pulled the gash together, staunched the bleeding, and finally bound it up, so that when the doctor did at last arrive he had little to add. this incident gave me confidence and, what is more important still, gave others confidence. on the whole i had a happy time at ruyton, and have a pleasing memory of dr. elliot and his wife. after a winter’s work at the university my next assistantship was a real money-making proposition to the extent of some two pounds a month. this was with dr. hoare, a well-known birmingham doctor, who had a five-horse city practice, and every working doctor, before the days of motors, would realize that this meant going from morning to night. he earned some three thousand a year, which takes some doing, when it is collected from 3_s._ 6_d._ visits and 1_s._ 6_d._ bottles of medicine, among the very poorest classes of aston. hoare was a fine fellow, stout, square, red-faced, bushy-whiskered and dark-eyed. his wife was also a very kindly and gifted woman, and my position in the house was soon rather that of a son than of an assistant. the work, however, was hard and incessant, and the pay very small. i had long lists of prescriptions to make up every day, for we dispensed our own medicine, and one hundred bottles of an evening were not unknown. on the whole i made few mistakes, though i have been known to send out ointment and pill boxes with elaborate directions on the lid and nothing inside. i had my own visiting list, also, the poorest or the most convalescent, and i saw a great deal, for better or worse, of very low life. twice i returned to this birmingham practice and always my relations with the family became closer. at my second visit my knowledge had greatly extended and i did midwifery cases, and the more severe cases in general practice as well as all the dispensing. i had no time to spend any money and it was as well, for every shilling was needed at home. it was in this year that i first learned that shillings might be earned in other ways than by filling phials. some friend remarked to me that my letters were very vivid and surely i could write some things to sell. i may say that the general aspiration towards literature was tremendously strong upon me, and that my mind was reaching out in what seemed an aimless way in all sorts of directions. i used to be allowed twopence for my lunch, that being the price of a mutton pie, but near the pie shop was a second-hand book shop with a barrel full of old books and the legend “your choice for 2_d._” stuck above it. ofter the price of my luncheon used to be spent on some sample out of this barrel, and i have within reach of my arm as i write these lines, copies of gordon’s tacitus, temple’s works, pope’s homer, addison’s spectator and swift’s works, which all came out of the twopenny box. any one observing my actions and tastes would have said that so strong a spring would certainly overflow, but for my own part i never dreamed i could myself produce decent prose, and the remark of my friend, who was by no means given to flattery, took me greatly by surprise. i sat down, however, and wrote a little adventure story which i called “the mystery of the sassassa valley.” to my great joy and surprise it was accepted by “chambers’ journal,” and i received three guineas. it mattered not that other attempts failed. i had done it once and i cheered myself by the thought that i could do it again. it was years before i touched “chambers’” again, but in 1879 i had a story, “the american’s tale,” in “london society,” for which also i got a small cheque. but the idea of real success was still far from my mind. during all this time our family affairs had taken no turn for the better, and had it not been for my excursions and for the work of my sisters we could hardly have carried on. my father’s health had utterly broken, he had to retire to that convalescent home in which the last years of his life were spent, and i, aged twenty, found myself practically the head of a large and struggling family. my father’s life was full of the tragedy of unfulfilled powers and of undeveloped gifts. he had his weaknesses, as all of us have ours, but he had also some very remarkable and outstanding virtues. a tall man, long-bearded, and elegant, he had a charm of manner and a courtesy of bearing which i have seldom seen equalled. his wit was quick and playful. he possessed, also, a remarkable delicacy of mind which would give him moral courage enough to rise and leave any company which talked in a manner which was coarse. when he passed away a few years later i am sure that charles doyle had no enemy in the world, and that those who knew him best sympathized most with the hard fate which had thrown him, a man of sensitive genius, into an environment which neither his age nor his nature was fitted to face. he was unworldly and unpractical and his family suffered for it, but even his faults were in some ways the result of his developed spirituality. he lived and died a fervent son of the roman catholic faith. my mother, however, who had never been a very devoted daughter of that great institution, became less so as life progressed, and finally found her chief consolation in the anglican fold. this brings me to my own spiritual unfolding, if such it may be called, during those years of constant struggle. i have already in my account of the jesuits shown how, even as a boy, all that was sanest and most generous in my nature rose up against a narrow theology and an uncharitable outlook upon the other great religions of the world. in the catholic church to doubt anything is to doubt everything, for since it is a vital axiom that doubt is a mortal sin when once it has, unbidden and unappeasable, come upon you, everything is loosened and you look upon the whole wonderful interdependent scheme with other and more critical eyes. thus viewed there was much to attract--its traditions, its unbroken and solemn ritual, the beauty and truth of many of its observances, its poetical appeal to the emotions, the sensual charm of music, light and incense, its power as an instrument of law and order. for the guidance of an unthinking and uneducated world it could in many ways hardly be surpassed, as has been shown in paraguay, and in the former ireland where, outside agrarian trouble, crime was hardly known. all this i could clearly see, but if i may claim any outstanding characteristic in my life, it is that i have never paltered or compromised with religious matters, that i have always weighed them very seriously, and that there was something in me which made it absolutely impossible, even when my most immediate interests were concerned, to say anything about them save that which i, in the depth of my being, really believed to be true. judging it thus by all the new knowledge which came to me both from my reading and from my studies, i found that the foundations not only of roman catholicism but of the whole christian faith, as presented to me in nineteenth century theology, were so weak that my mind could not build upon them. it is to be remembered that these were the years when huxley, tyndall, darwin, herbert spencer and john stuart mill were our chief philosophers, and that even the man in the street felt the strong sweeping current of their thought, while to the young student, eager and impressionable, it was overwhelming. i know now that their negative attitude was even more mistaken, and very much more dangerous, than the positive positions which they attacked with such destructive criticism. a gap had opened between our fathers and ourselves so suddenly and completely that when a gladstone wrote to uphold the gadarene swine, or the six days of creation, the youngest student rightly tittered over his arguments, and it did not need a huxley to demolish them. i can see now very clearly how deplorable it is that manifest absurdities should be allowed to continue without even a footnote to soften them in the sacred text, because it has the effect that what is indeed sacred becomes overlaid, and one can easily be persuaded that what is false in parts can have no solid binding force. there are no worse enemies of true religion than those who clamour against all revision or modification of that strange mass of superbly good and questionable matter which we lump all together into a single volume as if there were the same value to all of it. it is not solid gold, but gold in clay, and if this be understood the earnest seeker will not cast it aside when he comes upon the clay, but will value the gold the more in that he has himself separated it. it was, then, all christianity, and not roman catholicism alone, which had alienated my mind and driven me to an agnosticism, which never for an instant degenerated into atheism, for i had a very keen perception of the wonderful poise of the universe and the tremendous power of conception and sustenance which it implied. i was reverent in all my doubts and never ceased to think upon the matter, but the more i thought the more confirmed became my non-conformity. in a broad sense i was a unitarian, save that i regarded the bible with more criticism than unitarians usually show. this negative position was so firm that it seemed to me to be a terminus; whereas it proved only a junction on the road of life where i was destined to change from the old well-worn line on to a new one. every materialist, as i can now clearly see, is a case of arrested development. he has cleared his ruins, but has not begun to build that which would shelter him. as to psychic knowledge, i knew it only by the account of exposures in the police courts and the usual wild and malicious statements in the public press. years were to pass before i understood that in that direction might be found the positive proofs which i constantly asserted were the only conditions upon which i could resume any sort of allegiance to the unseen. i must have definite demonstration, for if it were to be a matter of faith then i might as well go back to the faith of my fathers. “never will i accept anything which cannot be proved to me. the evils of religion have all come from accepting things which cannot be proved.” so i said at the time and i have been true to my resolve. i would not give the impression that my life was gloomy or morbidly thoughtful because it chanced that i had some extra cares and some worrying thoughts. i had an eager nature which missed nothing in the way of fun which could be gathered, and i had a great capacity for enjoyment. i read much. i played games all i could. i danced, and i sampled the drama whenever i had a sixpence to carry me to the gallery. on one occasion i got into a row which might have been serious. i was waiting on the gallery steps with a great line of people, the shut door still facing us. there were half a dozen soldiers in the crowd and one of these squeezed a girl up against the wall in such a way that she began to scream. as i was near them i asked the man to be more gentle, on which he dug his elbow with all his force into my ribs. he turned on me as he did so, and i hit him with both hands in the face. he bored into me and pushed me up into the angle of the door, but i had a grip of him and he could not hit me, though he tried to kick me in cowardly fashion with his knee. several of his comrades threatened me, and one hit me on the head with his cane, cracking my hat. at this moment luckily the door opened and the rush of the crowd carried the soldiers on, one sympathetic corporal saying, “take your breath, sir! take your breath!” i threw my man through the open door and came home, for it was clearly asking for trouble if i remained. it was a good escape from an awkward business. and now i come to the first real outstanding adventure in my life, which is worthy of a fresh chapter and of a more elaborate treatment. chapter iv whaling in the arctic ocean the _hope_--john gray--boxing--the terrible mate--our criminal--first sight of a woman--a hurricane--dangers of the fishing--three dips in the arctic--the idlers’ boat--whale taking--glamour of the arctic--effect of voyage. it was in the _hope_, under the command of the well-known whaler, john gray, that i paid a seven months’ visit to the arctic seas in the year 1880. i went in the capacity of surgeon, but as i was only twenty years of age when i started, and as my knowledge of medicine was that of an average third year’s student, i have often thought that it was as well that there was no very serious call upon my services. it came about in this way. one raw afternoon in edinburgh, whilst i was sitting reading hard for one of those examinations which blight the life of a medical student, there entered to me one currie, a fellow-student with whom i had some slight acquaintance. the monstrous question which he asked drove all thought of my studies out of my head. “would you care,” said he, “to start next week for a whaling cruise? you’ll be surgeon, two pound ten a month and three shillings a ton oil money.” “how do you know i’ll get the berth?” was my natural question. “because i have it myself. i find at this last moment that i can’t go, and i want to get a man to take my place.” “how about an arctic kit?” “you can have mine.” in an instant the thing was settled, and within a few minutes the current of my life had been deflected into a new channel. in little more than a week i was in peterhead, and busily engaged, with the help of the steward, in packing away my scanty belongings in the locker beneath my bunk on the good ship _hope_. i speedily found that the chief duty of the surgeon was to be the companion of the captain, who is cut off by the etiquette of the trade from anything but very brief and technical talks with his other officers. i should have found it intolerable if the captain had been a bad fellow, but john gray of the _hope_ was a really splendid man, a grand seaman and a serious-minded scot, so that he and i formed a comradeship which was never marred during our long _tête-à-tête_. i see him now, his ruddy face, his grizzled hair and beard, his very light blue eyes always looking into far spaces, and his erect muscular figure. taciturn, sardonic, stern on occasion, but always a good just man at bottom. there was one curious thing about the manning of the _hope_. the man who signed on as first mate was a little, decrepit, broken fellow, absolutely incapable of performing the duties. the cook’s assistant, on the other hand, was a giant of a man, red-bearded, bronzed, with huge limbs, and a voice of thunder. but the moment that the ship cleared the harbour the little, decrepit mate disappeared into the cook’s galley, and acted as scullery-boy for the voyage, while the mighty scullery-boy walked aft and became chief mate. the fact was, that the one had the certificate, but was past sailoring, while the other could neither read nor write, but was as fine a seaman as ever lived; so, by an agreement to which everybody concerned was party, they swapped their berths when they were at sea. colin mclean, with his six foot of stature, his erect, stalwart figure, and his fierce, red beard, pouring out from between the flaps of his sealing-cap, was an officer by natural selection, which is a higher title than that of a board of trade certificate. his only fault was that he was a very hot-blooded man, and that a little would excite him to a frenzy. i have a vivid recollection of an evening which i spent in dragging him off the steward, who had imprudently made some criticism upon his way of attacking a whale which had escaped. both men had had some rum, which had made the one argumentative and the other violent, and as we were all three seated in a space of about seven by four, it took some hard work to prevent bloodshed. every now and then, just as i thought all danger was past, the steward would begin again with his fatuous, “no offence, colin, but all i says is that if you had been a bit quicker on the fush----” i don’t know how often this sentence was begun, but never once was it ended; for at the word “fush” colin always seized him by the throat, and i colin round the waist, and we struggled until we were all panting and exhausted. then when the steward had recovered a little breath he would start that miserable sentence once more, and the “fush” would be the signal for another encounter. i really believe that if i had not been there the mate would have hurt him, for he was quite the angriest man that i have ever seen. there were fifty men upon our whaler, of whom half were scotchmen and half shetlanders, whom we picked up at lerwick as we passed. the shetlanders were the steadier and more tractable, quiet, decent, and soft-spoken; while the scotch seamen were more likely to give trouble, but also more virile and of stronger character. the officers and harpooners were all scotch, but as ordinary seamen, and especially as boatmen, the shetlanders were as good as could be wished. there was only one man on board who belonged neither to scotland nor to shetland, and he was the mystery of the ship. he was a tall, swarthy, dark-eyed man, with blue-black hair and beard, singularly handsome features, and a curious, reckless sling of his shoulders when he walked. it was rumoured that he came from the south of england, and that he had fled thence to avoid the law. he made friends with no one, and spoke very seldom, but he was one of the smartest seamen in the ship. i could believe from his appearance that his temper was satanic, and that the crime for which he was hiding may have been a bloody one. only once he gave us a glimpse of his hidden fires. the cook--a very burly, powerful man--the little mate was only assistant--had a private store of rum, and treated himself so liberally to it that for three successive days the dinner of the crew was ruined. on the third day our silent outlaw approached the cook with a brass saucepan in his hand. he said nothing, but he struck the man such a frightful blow that his head flew through the bottom and the sides of the pan were left dangling round his neck. the half-drunken, half-stunned cook talked of fighting, but he was soon made to feel that the sympathy of the ship was against him, so he reeled back, grumbling, to his duties while the avenger relapsed into his usual moody indifference. we heard no further complaints of the cooking. i have spoken of the steward, and as i look back at that long voyage, during which for seven months we never set foot on land, the kindly open face of jack lamb comes back to me. he had a beautiful and sympathetic tenor voice, and many an hour have i listened to it with its accompaniment of rattling plates and jingling knives, as he cleaned up the dishes in his pantry. he had a great memory for pathetic and sentimental songs, and it is only when you have not seen a woman’s face for six months that you realize what sentiment means. when jack trilled out “her bright smile haunts me still,” or “wait for me at heaven’s gate, sweet belle mahone,” he filled us all with a vague sweet discontent which comes back to me now as i think of it. to appreciate a woman one has to be out of sight of one for six months. i can well remember that as we rounded the north of scotland on our return we dipped our flag to the lighthouse, being only some hundreds of yards from the shore. a figure emerged to answer our salute, and the excited whisper ran through the ship, “it’s a wumman!” the captain was on the bridge with his telescope. i had the binoculars in the bows. every one was staring. she was well over fifty, short skirts and sea boots--but she was a “wumman.” “anything in a mutch!” the sailors used to say, and i was of the same way of thinking. however, all this has come before its time. it was, i find by my log, on february 28 at 2 p.m. that we sailed from peterhead, amid a great crowd and uproar. the decks were as clean as a yacht, and it was very unlike my idea of a whaler. we ran straight into bad weather and the glass went down at one time to 28.375, which is the lowest reading i can remember in all my ocean wanderings. we just got into lerwick harbour before the full force of the hurricane broke, which was so great that lying at anchor with bare poles and partly screened we were blown over to an acute angle. if it had taken us a few hours earlier we should certainly have lost our boats--and the boats are the life of a whaler. it was march 11 before the weather moderated enough to let us get on, and by that time there were twenty whalers in the bay, so that our setting forth was quite an occasion. that night and for a day longer the _hope_ had to take refuge in the lee of one of the outlying islands. i got ashore and wandered among peat bogs, meeting strange, barbarous, kindly people who knew nothing of the world. i was led back to the ship by a wild, long-haired girl holding a torch, for the peat holes make it dangerous at night--i can see her now, her tangled black hair, her bare legs, madder-stained petticoat, and wild features under the glare of the torch. i spoke to one old man there who asked me the news. i said, “the tay bridge is down,” which was then a fairly stale item. he said, “eh, have they built a brig over the tay?” after that i felt inclined to tell him about the indian mutiny. what surprised me most in the arctic regions was the rapidity with which you reach them. i had never realized that they lie at our very doors. i think that we were only four days out from shetland when we were among the drift ice. i awoke one morning to hear the bump, bump of the floating pieces against the side of the ship, and i went on deck to see the whole sea covered with them to the horizon. they were none of them large, but they lay so thick that a man might travel far by springing from one to the other. their dazzling whiteness made the sea seem bluer by contrast, and with a blue sky above, and that glorious arctic air in one’s nostrils, it was a morning to remember. once on one of the swaying, rocking pieces we saw a huge seal, sleek, sleepy, and imperturbable, looking up with the utmost assurance at the ship, as if it knew that the close time had still three weeks to run. further on we saw on the ice the long human-like prints of a bear. all this with the snowdrops of scotland still fresh in our glasses in the cabin. i have spoken about the close time, and i may explain that, by an agreement between the norwegian and british governments, the subjects of both nations are forbidden to kill a seal before april 3. the reason for this is that the breeding season is in march, and if the mothers should be killed before the young are able to take care of themselves, the race would soon become extinct. for breeding purposes the seals all come together at a variable spot, which is evidently pre-arranged among them, and as this place can be anywhere within many hundreds of square miles of floating ice, it is no easy matter for the fisher to find it. the means by which he sets about it are simple but ingenious. as the ship makes its way through the loose ice-streams, a school of seals is observed travelling through the water. their direction is carefully taken by compass and marked upon the chart. an hour afterwards perhaps another school is seen. this is also marked. when these bearings have been taken several times, the various lines upon the chart are prolonged until they intersect. at this point, or near it, it is likely that the main pack of the seals will be found. when you do come upon it, it is a wonderful sight. i suppose it is the largest assembly of creatures upon the face of the world--and this upon the open icefields hundreds of miles from the greenland coast. somewhere between 71 deg. and 75 deg. is the rendezvous, and the longitude is even vaguer; but the seals have no difficulty in finding the address. from the crow’s nest at the top of the main-mast, one can see no end of them. on the furthest visible ice one can still see that sprinkling of pepper grains. and the young lie everywhere also, snow-white slugs, with a little black nose and large dark eyes. their half-human cries fill the air; and when you are sitting in the cabin of a ship which is in the heart of the seal-pack, you would think you were next door to a monstrous nursery. the _hope_ was one of the first to find the seal-pack that year, but before the day came when hunting was allowed, we had a succession of strong gales, followed by a severe roll, which tilted the floating ice and launched the young seals prematurely into the water. and so, when the law at last allowed us to begin work, nature had left us with very little work to do. however, at dawn upon the third, the ship’s company took to the ice, and began to gather in its murderous harvest. it is brutal work, though not more brutal than that which goes on to supply every dinner-table in the country. and yet those glaring crimson pools upon the dazzling white of the icefields, under the peaceful silence of a blue arctic sky, did seem a horrible intrusion. but an inexorable demand creates an inexorable supply, and the seals, by their death, help to give a living to the long line of seamen, dockers, tanners, curers, triers, chandlers, leather merchants, and oil-sellers, who stand between this annual butchery on the one hand, and the exquisite, with his soft leather boots, or the savant, using a delicate oil for his philosophical instruments, upon the other. i have cause to remember that first day of sealing on account of the adventures which befell me. i have said that a strong swell had arisen, and as this was dashing the floating ice together the captain thought it dangerous for an inexperienced man to venture upon it. and so, just as i was clambering over the bulwarks with the rest, he ordered me back and told me to remain on board. my remonstrances were useless, and at last, in the blackest of tempers, i seated myself upon the top of the bulwarks, with my feet dangling over the outer side, and there i nursed my wrath, swinging up and down with the roll of the ship. it chanced, however, that i was really seated upon a thin sheet of ice which had formed upon the wood, and so when the swell threw her over to a particularly acute angle, i shot off and vanished into the sea between two ice-blocks. as i rose, i clawed on to one of these, and soon scrambled on board again. the accident brought about what i wished, however, for the captain remarked that as i was bound to fall into the ocean in any case, i might just as well be on the ice as on the ship. i justified his original caution by falling in twice again during the day, and i finished it ignominiously by having to take to my bed while all my clothes were drying in the engine-room. i was consoled for my misfortunes by finding that they amused the captain to such an extent that they drove the ill-success of our sealing out of his head, and i had to answer to the name of “the great northern diver” for a long time thereafter. i had a narrow escape once through stepping backwards over the edge of a piece of floating ice while i was engaged in skinning a seal. i had wandered away from the others, and no one saw my misfortune. the face of the ice was so even that i had no purchase by which to pull myself up, and my body was rapidly becoming numb in the freezing water. at last, however, i caught hold of the hind flipper of the dead seal, and there was a kind of nightmare tug-of-war, the question being whether i should pull the seal off or pull myself on. at last, however, i got my knee over the edge and rolled on to it. i remember that my clothes were as hard as a suit of armour by the time i reached the ship, and that i had to thaw my crackling garments before i could change them. this april sealing is directed against the mothers and young. then, in may, the sealer goes further north, and about latitude 77 deg. or 78 deg. he comes upon the old male seals, who are by no means such easy victims. they are wary creatures, and it takes good long-range shooting to bag them. then, in june, the sealing is over, and the ship bears away further north still, until in the 79th or 80th degree she is in the best greenland whaling latitudes. there we stayed for three months or so, with very varying fortunes, for though we pursued many whales, only four were slain. there are eight boats on board a whaler, but it is usual to send out only seven, for it takes six men to man each, so that when seven are out no one is left on board save the so-called “idlers” who have not signed to do seaman’s work at all. it happened, however, that aboard the _hope_ the idlers were rather a hefty crowd, so we volunteered to man the odd boat, and we made it, in our own estimation at least, one of the most efficient, both in sealing and in whaling. the steward, the second engineer, the donkey-engine man, and i were the oars, with a red-headed highlander for harpooner and the handsome outlaw to steer. our tally of seals was high, and in whaling we were once the lancing and once the harpooning boat, so our record was good. so congenial was the work to me that captain gray was good enough to offer to make me harpooner as well as surgeon, with the double pay, if i would come with him on a second voyage. it is well that i refused, for the life is dangerously fascinating. [illustration: steam-whaler “hope.”] it is exciting work pulling on to a whale. your own back is turned to him, and all you know about him is what you read upon the face of the boat-steerer. he is staring out over your head, watching the creature as it swims slowly through the water, raising his hand now and again as a signal to stop rowing when he sees that the eye is coming round, and then resuming the stealthy approach when the whale is end on. there are so many floating pieces of ice, that as long as the oars are quiet the boat alone will not cause the creature to dive. so you creep slowly up, and at last you are so near that the boat-steerer knows that you can get there before the creature has time to dive--for it takes some little time to get that huge body into motion. you see a sunken gleam in his eyes, and a flush in his cheeks, and it’s “give way, boys! give way, all! hard!” click goes the trigger of the big harpoon gun, and the foam flies from your oars. six strokes, perhaps, and then with a dull greasy squelch the bows run upon something soft, and you and your oars are sent flying in every direction. but little you care for that, for as you touched the whale you have heard the crash of the gun, and know that the harpoon has been fired point-blank into the huge, lead-coloured curve of its side. the creature sinks like a stone, the bows of the boat splash down into the water again, but there is the little red jack flying from the centre thwart to show that you are fast, and there is the line whizzing swiftly under the seats and over the bows between your outstretched feet. and this is the great element of danger--for it is rarely indeed that the whale has spirit enough to turn upon its enemies. the line is very carefully coiled by a special man named the line-coiler, and it is warranted not to kink. if it should happen to do so, however, and if the loop catches the limbs of any one of the boat’s crew, that man goes to his death so rapidly that his comrades hardly know that he has gone. it is a waste of fish to cut the line, for the victim is already hundreds of fathoms deep. “haud your hand, mon,” cried the harpooner, as a seaman raised his knife on such an occasion. “the fush will be a fine thing for the widdey.” it sounds callous, but there was philosophy at the base of it. this is the harpooning, and that boat has no more to do. but the lancing, when the weary fish is killed with the cold steel, is a more exciting because it is a more prolonged experience. you may be for half an hour so near to the creature that you can lay your hand upon its slimy side. the whale appears to have but little sensibility to pain, for it never winces when the long lances are passed through its body. but its instinct urges it to get its tail to work on the boats, and yours urges you to keep poling and boat-hooking along its side, so as to retain your safe position near its shoulder. even there, however, we found on one occasion that we were not quite out of danger’s way, for the creature in its flurry raised its huge-side-flapper and poised it over the boat. one flap would have sent us to the bottom of the sea, and i can never forget how, as we pushed our way from under, each of us held one hand up to stave off that great, threatening fin--as if any strength of ours could have availed if the whale had meant it to descend. but it was spent with loss of blood, and instead of coming down the fin rolled over the other way, and we knew that it was dead. who would swap that moment for any other triumph that sport can give? the peculiar other-world feeling of the arctic regions--a feeling so singular that if you have once been there the thought of it haunts you all your life--is due largely to the perpetual daylight. night seems more orange-tinted and subdued than day, but there is no great difference. some captains have been known to turn their hours right round out of caprice, with breakfast at night and supper at ten in the morning. there are your twenty-four hours, and you may carve them as you like. after a month or two the eyes grow weary of the eternal light, and you appreciate what a soothing thing our darkness is. i can remember as we came abreast of iceland, on our return, catching our first glimpse of a star, and being unable to take my eyes from it, it seemed such a dainty little twinkling thing. half the beauties of nature are lost through over-familiarity. your sense of loneliness also heightens the effect of the arctic seas. when we were in whaling latitudes it is probable that, with the exception of our consort, there was no vessel within 800 miles of us. for seven long months no letter and no news came to us from the southern world. we had left in exciting times. the afghan campaign had been undertaken, and war seemed imminent with russia. we returned opposite the mouth of the baltic without any means of knowing whether some cruiser might not treat us as we had treated the whales. when we met a fishing-boat at the north of shetland our first inquiry was as to peace or war. great events had happened during those seven months: the defeat of maiwand and the famous march of roberts from cabul to candahar. but it was all haze to us; and, to this day, i have never been able to get that particular bit of military history straightened out in my own mind. the perpetual light, the glare of the white ice, the deep blue of the water, these are the things which one remembers most clearly, and the dry, crisp, exhilarating air, which makes mere life the keenest of pleasures. and then there are the innumerable sea-birds, whose call is for ever ringing in your ears--the gulls, the fulmars, the snow-birds, the burgomasters, the loons, and the rotjes. these fill the air, and below, the waters are for ever giving you a peep of some strange new creature. the commercial whale may not often come your way, but his less valuable brethren abound on every side. the finner shows his 90 feet of worthless tallow, with the absolute conviction that no whaler would condescend to lower a boat for him. the mis-shapen hunchback whale, the ghost-like white whale, the narwhal, with his unicorn horn, the queer-looking bottle-nose, the huge, sluggish, greenland shark, and the terrible killing grampus, the most formidable of all the monsters of the deep,--these are the creatures who own those unsailed seas. on the ice are the seals, the saddle-backs, the ground seals and the huge bladdernoses, 12 feet from nose to tail, with the power of blowing up a great blood-red football upon their noses when they are angry, which they usually are. occasionally one sees a white arctic fox upon the ice, and everywhere are the bears. the floes in the neighbourhood of the sealing-ground are all criss-crossed with their tracks--poor harmless creatures, with the lurch and roll of a deep-sea mariner. it is for the sake of the seals that they come out over those hundreds of miles of ice; and they have a very ingenious method of catching them, for they will choose a big icefield with just one blow-hole for seals in the middle of it. here the bear will squat, with its powerful forearms crooked round the hole. then, when the seal’s head pops up, the great paws snap together, and bruin has got his luncheon. we used occasionally to burn some of the cook’s refuse in the engine-room fires, and the smell would, in a few hours, bring up every bear for many miles to leeward of us. though twenty or thirty whales have been taken in a single year in the greenland seas, it is probable that the great slaughter of last century has diminished their number until there are not more than a few hundreds in existence. i mean, of course, of the right whale, for the others, as i have said, abound. it is difficult to compute the numbers of a species which comes and goes over great tracts of water and among huge icefields, but the fact that the same whale is often pursued by the same whaler upon successive trips shows how limited their number must be. there was one, i remember, which was conspicuous through having a huge wart, the size and shape of a beehive, upon one of the flukes of its tail. “i’ve been after that fellow three times,” said the captain, as we dropped our boats. “he got away in ’71. in ’74 we had him fast, but the harpoon drew. in ’76 a fog saved him. it’s odds that we have him now!” i fancied that the betting lay rather the other way myself, and so it proved, for that warty tail is still thrashing the arctic seas for all that i know to the contrary. i shall never forget my own first sight of a right whale. it had been seen by the look-out on the other side of a small icefield, but had sunk as we all rushed on deck. for ten minutes we awaited its reappearance, and i had taken my eyes from the place, when a general gasp of astonishment made me glance up, and there was the whale _in the air_. its tail was curved just as a trout’s is in jumping, and every bit of its glistening lead-coloured body was clear of the water. it was little wonder that i should be astonished, for the captain, after thirty voyages, had never seen such a sight. on catching it we discovered that it was very thickly covered with a red, crab-like parasite, about the size of a shilling, and we conjectured that it was the irritation of these creatures which had driven it wild. if a man had short, nailless flippers, and a prosperous family of fleas upon his back, he would appreciate the situation. apart from sport, there is a glamour about those circumpolar regions which must affect everyone who has penetrated to them. my heart goes out to that old, grey-headed whaling captain who, having been left for an instant when at death’s door, staggered off in his night gear, and was found by nurses far from his house and still, as he mumbled, “pushing to the norrard.” so an arctic fox, which a friend of mine endeavoured to tame, escaped, and was caught many months afterwards in a gamekeeper’s trap in caithness. it was also pushing norrard, though who can say by what strange compass it took its bearings? it is a region of purity, of white ice and of blue water, with no human dwelling within a thousand miles to sully the freshness of the breeze which blows across the icefields. and then it is a region of romance also. you stand on the very brink of the unknown, and every duck that you shoot bears pebbles in its gizzard which come from a land which the maps know not. it was a strange and fascinating chapter of my life. i went on board the whaler a big, straggling youth, i came off it a powerful, well-grown man. i have no doubt that my physical health during my whole life has been affected by that splendid air, and that the inexhaustible store of energy which i have enjoyed is to some extent drawn from the same source. it was mental and spiritual stagnation, or even worse, for there is a coarsening effect in so circumscribed a life with comrades who were fine, brave fellows, but naturally rough and wild. however i had my health to show for it, and also more money than i had ever possessed before. i was still boyish in many ways, and i remember that i concealed gold pieces in every pocket of every garment, that my mother might have the excitement of hunting for them. it added some fifty pounds to her small exchequer. now i had a straight run in to my final examination, which i passed with fair but not notable distinction at the end of the winter session of 1881. i was now a bachelor of medicine and a master of surgery, fairly launched upon my professional career. chapter v the voyage to west africa the _mayumba_--fearful weather--an escape--hanno’s voyage-- atlantis--a land of death--blackwater fever--missionaries--strange fish--danger of luxury--a foolish swim--the ship on fire--england once more. it had always been my intention to take a voyage as ship’s surgeon when i had taken my degree, as i could in this way see something of the world, and at the same time earn a little of the money which i so badly needed if i were ever to start in practice for myself. when a man is in the very early twenties he will not be taken seriously as a practitioner, and though i looked old for my age, it was clear that i had to fill in my time in some other way. my plans were all exceedingly fluid, and i was ready to join the army, navy, indian service or anything which offered an opening. i had no reason to think that i would find a billet upon a passenger ship and had nearly forgotten that i had my name down, when i suddenly received a telegram telling me to come to liverpool and to take medical charge of the african steam navigation company’s _mayumba_, bound for the west coast. in a week i was there, and on october 22, 1881, we started on our voyage. the _mayumba_ was a trim little steamer of about 4,000 tons--a giant after my experience in the 200-ton whaler. she was built for commerce, carrying mixed cargoes to the coast and coming back with palm oil in puncheons, palm nuts in bulk, ivory and other tropical products. what with whale oil and palm oil there certainly seemed to be something greasy about my horoscope. there was room for twenty or thirty passengers, and it was for their behoof that i was paid some £12 a month. it was well that we were seaworthy, for we put out in a violent gale, which became so bad as we emerged from the mersey that we were forced into holyhead for the night. next day, in vile and thick weather, with a strong sea running, we made our way down the irish sea. i shall always believe that i may have saved the ship from disaster, for as i was standing near the officer of the watch i suddenly caught sight of a lighthouse standing out in a rift in the fog. it was on the port side and i could not imagine how any lighthouse could be on the port side of a ship which was, as i knew, well down on the irish coast. i hate to be an alarmist, so i simply touched the mate’s sleeve, pointed to the dim outline of the lighthouse, and said: “is that all right?” he fairly jumped as his eye lit upon it and he gave a yell to the men at the wheel and rang a violent signal to the engine-room. the lighthouse, if i remember right, was the tuskar, and we were heading right into a rocky promontory which was concealed by the rain and fog. i have been lucky in my captains, for captain gordon wallace was one of the best, and we have kept in touch during the later years. our passengers were mostly for madeira, but there were some pleasant ladies bound for the coast, and some unpleasant negro traders whose manners and bearing were objectionable, but who were patrons of the line and must, therefore, be tolerated. some of these palm oil chiefs and traders have incomes of many thousands a year, but as they have no cultivated tastes they can only spend their money on drink, debauchery and senseless extravagance. one of them, i remember, had a choice selection of the demi-monde of liverpool to see him off. the storms followed us all the way down the channel and across the bay, which is normal, i suppose, at such a time of year. everyone was seasick, so as doctor i had some work to do. however, before we reached madeira we ran into fine weather and all our troubles were soon forgotten. one never realizes the comfort of a dry deck until one has been ankle-deep for a week. i missed the sea-boots and rough-and-ready dress of the whaler, for when one is in blue serge and gilt buttons one does not care to take a ducking. just as we thought, however, that we were all right a worse gale than ever broke over us, the wind luckily being behind us, so that it helped us on our way. with jib, trysail and main staysail, which was as much as we could stand, we lurched and staggered, swept every now and then by the big atlantic combers, which were phosphorescent at night, so that flames of liquid fire came coursing down the decks. very glad we were when after a week of storm we saw the rugged peaks of porto sancto, an outlier of madeira, and finally came to anchor in funchal bay. it was dark when we reached our moorings and it was good to see the lights of the town, and the great dark loom of the hills behind it. a lunar rainbow spanned the whole scene, a rare phenomenon which i have never seen before or since. teneriffe was our next stopping-place, santa cruz being the port of call. in those days it did a great trade in cochineal, which was derived from an insect cultivated on the cacti. when dried they furnished the dye, and a packet of the creatures averaged £350 at that time, but now i suppose that the german aniline dyes have killed the trade as completely as whaling has been killed by the mineral. a day later we were at las palmas, capital of grand canary, whence, looking back, we had a fine view of the famous teneriffe peak some 60 miles away. leaving las palmas we were in the delightful region of the northeast trade-winds, the most glorious part of the ocean, seldom rough, yet always lively, with foam-capped seas and a clear sky. day by day it grew hotter, however, and when we lost the trades, and sighted the isle de los off the sierra leone coast, i began to realize what the tropics meant. when you feel your napkin at meals to be an intolerable thing, and when you find that it leaves a wet weal across your white duck trousers, then you know that you really have arrived. on november 9 we reached freetown, the capital of sierra leone, our first port of call upon the african main--a lovely spot but a place of death. here our ladies left us, and indeed it was sad to see them go, for female lives are even shorter than male upon the coast. i speak of the days of malaria and blackwater fever, before ronald ross and others had done their great work of healing and prevention. it was a truly dreadful place in the early eighties, and the despair which reigned in the hearts of the white people made them take liberties with alcohol which they would not have dared to take in a healthier place. a year’s residence seemed to be about the limit of human endurance. i remember meeting one healthy-looking resident who told me that he had been there three years. when i congratulated him he shook his head. “i am a doomed man. i have advanced bright’s disease,” said he. one wondered whether the colonies were really worth the price we had to pay. from sierra leone we steamed to monrovia, which is the capital of the negro republic of liberia, which, as the name implies, was founded mainly by escaped slaves. so far as i could see it was orderly enough, though all small communities which take themselves seriously have a comic aspect. thus at the time of the franco-german war, liberia is said to have sent out its single customs boat, which represented its official navy, and stopped the british mail-ship in order to send word to europe that it did not intend to interfere in the matter. it is a very monotonous view, for whether it is the ivory coast or the gold coast, or the liberian shore, it always presents the same features--burning sunshine, a long swell breaking into a white line of surf, a margin of golden sand, and then the low green bush, with an occasional palm tree rising above it. if you have seen a mile, you have seen a thousand. as i write now, these ports at which we stopped, grand bassam, cape palmas, accra, cape coast castle, all form the same picture in my mind. one incident only i can remember. at some small village, the name of which i have forgotten, there came off a tall young welshman in a state of furious excitement; his niggers had mutinied and he was in fear of his life. “there they are waiting for me!” he cried, and pointed to a dusky group upon the distant beach. we offered to take him on, but he could not leave his property, so all we could do was to promise to send a gunboat up from cape coast castle. i have often wondered how such people got on after the german menace compelled us to draw in all our outlying fleets. this coast is dotted at night with native fires, some of them of great extent, arising no doubt from their habit of burning the grass. it is interesting that in hanno’s account of his journey down the coast--the only piece of carthaginian literature which has reached us--he talks also of the fires which he saw at night. as he speaks of gorillas it is probable that he got as far as the gaboon, or south of the line. he saw great volcanic activity, and the remains of it is still visible at fernando po, which is almost all volcanic. in hanno’s time, however, the hills were actually spouting fire and the country was a sea of flame, so that he dare not set foot on shore. i have wondered sometimes whether the last cataclysm at atlantis may not have been much later than we think. the account of plato puts it at about 9000 b.c., but it may well have been a gradual thing and the last spasm have been that of which hanno saw the traces. all this activity which he described is exactly opposite the spot where the old continent was supposed to have been. our ships have rough-and-ready ways as they jog down the coast. once we moved on while a hundred native visitors were still on board. it was funny to see them dive off and make for their canoes. one of them had a tall hat, an umbrella, and a large coloured picture of the saviour--all of which he had bought at the trading booths which the men rig up in the forecastle. these impedimenta did not prevent him from swimming to his boat. at another minor port, since we were pressed for time, we simply threw our consignment of barrel staves overboard, knowing that soon or late they would wash up on the beach, though how the real owner could make good his claim to them i do not know. occasionally the native scores in this game. some years ago, before dahomey was annexed by the french, the captain took the oil casks on board at whydah by means of a long rope and a donkey engine, an ingenious way of avoiding the surf, which came to a sudden stop when a company of the famous amazons appeared and threatened to fire upon the ship if they did not pay their dues to the surf boats in the ordinary fashion. i had myself to pay my dues to the climate, for on november 18 i find an eloquent gap in my diary. we had reached lagos, and there, rolling in a greasy swell off that huge lagoon, the germ or the mosquito or whatever it was reached me and i was down with a very sharp fever. i remember staggering to my bunk and then all was blotted out. as i was myself doctor there was no one to look after me and i lay for several days fighting it out with death in a very small ring and without a second. it speaks well for my constitution that i came out a victor. i remember no psychic experience, no vision, no fears, nothing save a nightmare fog from which i emerged as weak as a child. it must have been a close call, and i had scarcely sat up before i heard that another victim who got it at the same time was dead. a week later found me, convalescent and full of energy once more, up the bonny river, which certainly never got its name from the scotch adjective, for it is in all ways hateful with its brown smelling stream and its mango swamps. the natives were all absolute savages, offering up human sacrifices to sharks and crocodiles. the captain had heard the screams of the victims and seen them dragged down to the water’s edge, while on another occasion he had seen the protruding skull of a man who had been buried in an ant-heap. it is all very well to make game of the missionaries, but how could such people ever be improved if it were not for the labours of devoted men? we called at fernando po, and later at victoria, a lovely little settlement upon the main, with the huge peak of the cameroons rising behind it. a dear homely scotch lassie was playing the part of missionary there, and if she did not evangelize she at least civilized, which is more important. it lies in a beautiful bay studded with islands and well wooded all round. for some reason the whole style of the scenery changes completely here, and it is the more welcome after the thousand miles of monotony to the north. all this land went, for some reason, to germany later, and has now reverted to the french, who are not, as a rule, good colonial neighbours. i went ashore at victoria, and i cannot forget my thrill when what i thought was a good-sized blue bird passed me and i found that it was a butterfly. to reach old calabar we had to steam for 60 miles up the old calabar river, the channel lying so near the shore that we brushed the trees on one side. i lay in wait with my rifle, but though i saw the swirl of several alligators none emerged. old calabar seemed the largest and most prosperous place we had visited, but here also the hand of death was over all, and it was “eat, drink, and be merry” for the old and unsatisfactory reason. here again we met one of these young lady pioneers of civilization. civilization is the better, but it is a stern and dreadful call which summons a woman to such a work. getting a canoe, i ascended the river for several miles to a place called creektown. dark and terrible mangrove swamps lay on either side with gloomy shades where nothing that is not horrible could exist. it is indeed a foul place. once in an isolated tree, standing in a flood, i saw an evil-looking snake, worm-coloured and about 3 feet long. i shot him and saw him drift down stream. i learned later in life to give up killing animals, but i confess that i have no particular compunctions about that one. creektown is in native territory, and the king sent down a peremptory order that we should report ourselves to him, but as it sounded ominous and might mean a long delay we got our paddles out and were soon back in british waters. i had a curious experience one morning. a large ribbon-shaped fish, about 3 or 4 feet long, came up and swam upon the surface near the ship. having my gun handy, i shot it. i don’t think five seconds could have elapsed before another larger and thicker fish--a big catfish, i should say--darted up from the depths, seized the wounded fish by the middle, and dragged it down. so murderous is the food-search, and so keen the watch in nature! i saw something similar in the mixed tank of an aquarium once, where a fish stunned himself by swimming against the glass front, and was instantly seized and devoured by his neighbour. a strange fish to which i was introduced at calabar was the electrical torpedo fish. it is handed to you in an earthenware saucer--a quiet little drab creature about 5 inches long--and you are asked to tickle its back. then you learn exactly how high you can jump. the death-like impression of africa grew upon me. one felt that the white man with his present diet and habits was an intruder who was never meant to be there, and that the great sullen brown continent killed him as one crushes nits. i find in my diary: “oh africa, where are the charms that sages have seen in thy face? better dwell in old england on alms than be rich in that terrible place.” the life aboard ship, however, was an easy and, in some ways, a luxurious one--too luxurious for a young man who had his way to make in the world. premature comfort is a deadly enervating thing. i remember considering my own future--i stood upon the poop with a raging thunderstorm around me--and seeing very clearly that one or two more such voyages would sap my simple habits and make me unfit for the hard struggle which any sort of success would need. the idea of success in literature had never crossed my mind. it was still of medicine only that i thought, but i knew by my birmingham experience how long and rough a path it was for those who had no influence and could not afford to buy. then and there i vowed that i would wander no more, and that was surely one of the turning-points of my life. a “wander-jahr” is good, but two “wander-jahre” may mean damnation--and it is hard to stop. i find that on the same day of fruitful meditation i swore off alcohol for the rest of the voyage. i drank quite freely at this period of my life, having a head and a constitution which made me fairly immune, but my reason told me that the unbounded cocktails of west africa were a danger, and with an effort i cut them out. there is a certain subtle pleasure in abstinence, and it is only socially that it is difficult. if we were all abstainers as a matter of course, like the real mahomedans, none of us would ever miss it. i did a mad thing at cape coast castle, for, in a spirit either of bravado or pure folly, i swam round the ship--or at least for some length along her and back again. i suppose it was the consideration that black folk go freely into the water which induced me to do it. for some reason white folk do not share the same immunity. as i was drying myself on deck i saw the triangular back fin of a shark rise to the surface. several times in my life i have done utterly reckless things with so little motive that i have found it difficult to explain them to myself afterwards. this was one of them. the most intelligent and well-read man whom i met on the coast was a negro, the american consul at monrovia. he came on with us as a passenger. my starved literary side was eager for good talk, and it was wonderful to sit on deck discussing bancroft and motley, and then suddenly realize that you were talking to one who had possibly been a slave himself, and was certainly the son of slaves. he had thought a good deal about african travel. “the only way to explore africa is to go without arms and with few servants. you would not like it in england if a body of men came armed to the teeth and marched through your land. the africans are quite as sensitive.” it was the method of livingstone as against the method of stanley. the former takes the braver and better man. this negro gentleman did me good, for a man’s brain is an organ for the formation of his own thoughts and also for the digestion of other people’s, and it needs fresh fodder. we had, of course, books aboard the ship, but neither many nor good. i cannot trace that i made any mental or spiritual advancement during the voyage, but i added one more experience to my chaplet, and i suppose it all goes to some ultimate result in character or personality. i was a strong full-blooded young man, full of the joy of life, with nothing of what oliver wendell holmes calls “pathological piety and tuberculous virtues.” i was a man among men. i walked ever among pitfalls and i thank all ministering angels that i came through, while i have a softened heart for those who did not. our voyage home--oil-gathering from port to port on the same but reversed route--was uneventful until the very last stride, when just as we were past madeira the ship took fire. whether it was the combustion of coal dust has never been determined, but certainly the fire broke out in the bunkers, and as there was only a wooden partition between these bunkers and a cargo of oil, we were in deadly danger. for the first day we took it lightly, as a mere smoulder, and for a second and third day we were content to seal the gratings as far as possible, to play down on it with the hose, and to shift the coal away from the oil. on the fourth morning, however, things took a sudden turn for the worse. i copy from my log book: “january 9. i was awakened early in the morning by the purser, tom king, poking his head in at my door and informing me that the ship was in a blaze, and that all hands had been called and were working down below. i got my clothes on, but when i came on deck nothing was to be seen of it save thick volumes of smoke from the bunker ventilators, and a lurid glow down below. i offered to go down, but there seemed to be as many working as could be fitted in. i was then asked to call the passengers. i waked each in turn, and they all faced the situation very bravely and coolly. one, a swiss, sat up in his bunk, rubbed his eyes, and in answer to my remark: ‘the ship is on fire!’ said: ‘i have often been on ships that were on fire.’ ‘splendide mendax’--but a good spirit! all day we fought the flames, and the iron side of the ship was red-hot at one point. boats were prepared and provisioned and no doubt at the worst we could row or sail them to lisbon, where my dear sisters would be considerably surprised if their big brother walked in. however, we are getting the better of it, and by evening those ominous pillars of smoke were down to mere wisps. so ends an ugly business!” on january 14 we were in liverpool once more, and west africa was but one more of the cinema reels of memory. it is, i am told, very much improved now in all things. my old friend and cricket companion, sir fred. guggisberg, is governor at accra and has asked me to see the old ground under very different auspices. i wish i could, but the sands still run and there is much to be done. chapter vi my first experiences in practice a strange character--his honeymoon--his bristol practice--telegram from plymouth--six amusing weeks--a deep plot--my southsea venture--furnishing on the cheap--the plot explodes. i have now come to the temporary end of my voyages, which were to be renewed in years to come, and i have reached the time when, under very curious circumstances, i endeavoured to establish myself in medical practice. in a book written some years afterwards called “the stark munro letters,” i drew in very close detail the events of the next few years, and there the curious reader will find them more clearly and fully set out than would be to scale in these pages. i would only remark, should any reader reconstruct me or my career from that book, that there are some few incidents there which are imaginary, and that, especially, the whole incident of the case of a lunatic and of lord saltire in chapter iv occurred to a friend and not to myself. otherwise the whole history of my association with the man whom i called cullingworth, his extraordinary character, our parting and the way in which i was left to what seemed certain ruin, were all as depicted. i will here simply give the essentials of the story, and retain the fictitious name. in my last year of study at edinburgh i formed a friendship with this remarkable student. he came of a famous medical family, his father having been a great authority upon zymotic disease. he came also of a famous athletic stock, and was a great rugby forward himself, though rather handicapped by the berserk fury with which he would play. he was up to international form, and his younger brother was reckoned by good judges to be about the best forward who ever donned the rose-embroidered jersey of england. cullingworth was as strong mentally as physically. in person he was about 5 ft. 9 in. in height, perfectly built, with a bulldog jaw, bloodshot deep-set eyes, overhanging brows, and yellowish hair as stiff as wire, which spurted up above his brows. he was a man born for trouble and adventure, unconventional in his designs and formidable in his powers of execution--a man of action with a big but incalculable brain guiding the action. he died in early middle age, and i understand that an autopsy revealed some cerebral abnormality, so that there was no doubt a pathological element in his strange explosive character. for some reason he took a fancy to me, and appeared to attach an undue importance to my advice. when i met him first he had just indulged in one of his wild escapades, which ended usually in a fight or in a transitory appearance in a police court, but on this occasion was more serious and permanent. he had run off with a charming young lady and married her, she being a ward in chancery and under age. however, the deed was done and all the lawyers in the world could not undo it, though they might punish the culprit. he told me how he and the lady had gone over a bradshaw with the intention that when they came on a station of which neither of them had ever heard, they would make for that place and spend their honeymoon there. they came therefore upon some awful name, clodpole-in-the-marsh or something of the kind, and there they sojourned in the village inn. cullingworth stained his yellow hair black, but the stain took in some places and not in others, so that he looked as if he had escaped from barnum’s show. what clodpole-in-the-marsh could have thought of such an extraordinary couple i cannot imagine, and it is probably the one occasion on which it ever buzzed. i cannot think of any surer way of getting publicity than that which cullingworth took to avoid detection. in london they would have been perfectly unobserved. i remember that for years cullingworth’s hair presented curious iridescent tints which were the remains of his disguise. he brought his bride safely to edinburgh, where they hired a flat and lived in it without furnishing it save for the absolutely needful. i have dined with them there on an apple dumpling, seated on a pile of thick volumes as there was no chair. we introduced them to a few friends, did what we could for the lonely lady, and finally they drifted off, and for a time we heard no more. just before i started for africa i got a long telegram from cullingworth imploring me to go to bristol as he needed my advice. i was in birmingham and i set forth at once. when i reached bristol he conducted me to a fine mansion, and there poured out his tale of woe. he had started in great style, hoping to rally the remains of his father’s patients, but his money had run out, he was dunned by his tradespeople, there were no patients, and what was he to do? we had a joyous riotous time for two days, for there was an exuberant atmosphere about the man which rose above all trouble. the only advice i could give was that he should make a composition with his creditors. i heard afterwards that he assembled them, addressed them in a long and emotional speech, reduced them almost to tears with his picture of the struggles of a deserving young man, and finally got a unanimous vote of confidence from them with full consent that he should pay at his own leisure. it was the sort of thing that he would do, and tell the story afterwards with a bull’s roar of laughter which could be heard down the street. when i had been back a couple of months from africa, i received another telegram--he always telegraphed and never wrote--which ran in some such way as this: “started here last june. colossal success. come down by next train if possible. plenty of room for you. splendid opening.” the telegram was stamped plymouth. a second even more explosive telegram upbraided me for delay and guaranteed me £300 the first year. this looked like business, so off i went. the events of the next six weeks, in the late spring and early summer of 1882, were more fitted for some rollicking novel than for the sober pages of a veracious chronicle. the conditions which i found at plymouth were incredible. in a short time this man, half genius and half quack, had founded a practice worth several thousand pounds of ready money in the year. “free consultations but pay for your medicine,” was his slogan, and as he charged a good price for the latter it worked out all the same in the end. the mere words “free consultations” attracted crowds. he used drugs in a heroic and indiscriminate manner which produced dramatic results but at an unjustifiable risk. i remember one instance where dropsy had disappeared before a severe dose of croton oil in a way that set all the gossips talking. people flocked into the town from 20 and 30 miles round, and not only his waiting rooms, but his stairs and his passages, were crammed. his behaviour to them was extraordinary. he roared and shouted, scolded them, joked them, pushed them about, and pursued them sometimes into the street, or addressed them collectively from the landing. a morning with him when the practice was in full blast was as funny as any pantomime and i was exhausted with laughter. he had a well-worn volume on medical jurisprudence which he pretended was the bible, and he swore old women on it that they would drink no more tea. i have no doubt he did a great deal of good, for there was reason and knowledge behind all that he did, but his manner of doing it was unorthodox in the extreme. his wife made up the prescriptions at a pigeon-hole at the end of a passage and received the price which was marked on the label carried down by the patient. every evening cullingworth walked back to his great residential house upon the hoe, bearing his bag of silver, his coat flying, his hat on the back of his head, and his great fangs grinning up at every doctor whose disgusted face showed at a window. cullingworth had rigged me up a room, furnished with one table and two chairs, in which i could take surgical or other cases which he did not care to handle. i fear that my professional manners were very unexciting after his more flamboyant efforts, which i could not imitate even if i would. i had, however, a steady dribble of patients, and it looked as if i might build something up. i went up country once, and operated upon an old fellow’s nose which had contracted cancer through his holding the bowl of a short clay pipe immediately beneath it. i left him with an aristocratic, not to say supercilious organ, which was the wonder of the village, and might have been the foundation of my fame. but there were other influences at work, and the threads of fate were shooting out at strange unexpected angles. my mother had greatly resented my association with cullingworth. her family pride had been aroused, and justly as i can now see, though my wanderings had left me rather too bohemian and careless upon points of etiquette. but i liked cullingworth and even now i can’t help liking him--and i admired his strong qualities and enjoyed his company and the extraordinary situations which arose from any association with him. this resistance upon my part, and my defence of my friend, annoyed my mother the more, and she wrote me several letters of remonstrance which certainly dealt rather faithfully with his character as it appeared to her. i was careless of my papers and these letters were read both by cullingworth and his wife. i do them no injustice in saying this, for they finally admitted it. apparently he imagined--he was a man of strange suspicions and secret plottings--that i was a party to such sentiments, whereas they were actually called forth by my defence of him. his manner changed, and more than once i caught his fierce grey eyes looking furtively at me with a strange sullen expression, so much so that i asked him what was the matter. he was actually scheming my ruin, which would be nothing financially, since i had nothing to lose, but would be much both to my mother and me if it touched my honour. one day he came to me and told me that he thought my presence complicated his practice and that we had better part. i agreed in all good humour, assuring him that i had not come to hurt him and that i was very grateful for what he had done, even if it came to nothing. he then strongly advised me to go into practice myself. i replied that i had no capital. he answered that he would see to that, that he would allow me a pound a week until i got my feet under me, and that i could repay it at leisure. i thanked him warmly, and after looking at tavistock i finally decided that portsmouth would be a good place, the only reason being that i knew the conditions at plymouth, and portsmouth seemed analogous. i boarded an irish steamer, therefore, and about july of 1882 i started off by sea, with one small trunk containing all my earthly possessions, to start practice in a town in which i knew no single soul. my cash balance was under £10, and i knew not only that i had to meet all present expenses upon this, but that i had to furnish a house upon it. on the other hand the weekly pound should easily cover all personal needs, and i had the devil-may-care optimism of youth as to the future. when i arrived at portsmouth i went into lodgings for a week. on the very first night, with that curious faculty for running into dramatic situations which has always been with me, i became involved in a street fight with a rough who was beating (or rather kicking) a woman. it was a strange start, and after i began my practice one of the first people to whom i opened my door was this very rascal. i don’t suppose he recognized me, but i could have sworn to him. i emerged from the fray without much damage, and was very glad to escape some serious scandal. it was the second time that i had got knocked about in defence of beauty in distress. i spent a week in marking down the unoccupied houses, and finally settled at £40 a year into bush villa, which a kindly landlord has now called doyle house. i was terrified lest the agent should ask for a deposit, but the name of my c.b. uncle as reference turned the scale in my favour. having secured the empty house and its key, i went down to a sale in portsea and for about £4 secured quite a lot of second-hand--possibly tenth-hand--furniture. it met my needs and enabled me to make one room possible for patients with three chairs, a table and a central patch of carpet. i had a bed of sorts and a mattress upstairs. i fixed up the plate which i had brought from plymouth, bought a red lamp on tick, and fairly settled down in receipt of custom. when all was done i had a couple of pounds in hand. servants, of course, were out of the question, so i polished my own plate every morning, brushed down my front, and kept the house reasonably clean. i found that i could live quite easily and well on less than a shilling a day, so i could hold out for a long period. i had at this time contributed several stories to “london society,” a magazine now defunct, but then flourishing under the editorship of a mr. hogg. in the april, 1882, number i had a story, now happily forgotten, called “bones,” while in the preceding christmas number i had another, “the gully of bluemansdyke,” both of them feeble echoes of bret harte. these, with the stories already mentioned, made up my whole output at this time. i explained to mr. hogg how i was situated, and wrote for him a new tale for his christmas number entitled “my friend the murderer.” hogg behaved very well and sent me £10, which i laid by for my first quarter’s rent. i was not so pleased with him when, years later, he claimed the full copyright of all these immature stories, and published them in a volume with my name attached. have a care, young authors, have a care, or your worst enemy will be your early self! it was as well that i had that £10, for cullingworth, having learned that i was fairly committed, with my lease signed, now hurled his thunderbolt, which he thought would crush me. it was a curt letter--not a telegram for a wonder--in which he admitted that my letters had been read, expressed surprise that such a correspondence should have gone on while i was under his roof, and declared that he could have nothing more to do with me. he had, of course, no real grievance, but i am quite willing to admit that he honestly thought he had. but his method of revenge was a strange example of the schemings of a morbid mind. for a moment i was staggered. but my boats were burned and i must go forward. i sent back a derisive reply to cullingworth, and put him out of my head for ever--indeed, i heard of him no more until some five years later i read the news of his premature death. he was a remarkable man and narrowly escaped being a great one. i fear that he lived up to his great income and left his wife but poorly off. chapter vii my start at southsea a strange life--arrival of my brother--i buy up a shop--cheap servants--queer patients--dangers of medical practice--income tax joke--my marriage--tragedy in my house--a new phase. what with cleaning up, answering the bell, doing my modest shopping, which was measured in pennies rather than shillings, and perfecting my simple household arrangements, the time did not hang heavily upon my hands. it is a wonderful thing to have a house of your own for the first time, however humble it may be. i lavished all my care upon the front room to make it possible for patients. the back room was furnished with my trunk and a stool. inside the trunk was my larder, and the top of it was my dining-room table. there was gas laid on, and i rigged a projection from the wall by which i could sling a pan over the gas jet. in this way i cooked bacon with great ease, and became expert in getting a wonderful lot of slices from a pound. bread, bacon and tea, with an occasional saveloy--what could man ask for more? it is (or was) perfectly easy to live well upon a shilling a day. i had obtained a fair consignment of drugs on tick from a wholesale house and these also were ranged round the sides of the back room. from the very beginning a few stray patients of the poorest class, some of them desirous of novelty, some disgruntled with their own doctors, the greater part owing bills and ashamed to face their creditor, came to consult me and consume a bottle of my medicine. i could pay for my food by the drugs i sold. it was as well, for i had no other way of paying for it, and i had sworn not to touch the ten golden pieces which represented my rent. there have been times when i could not buy a postage stamp and my letters have had to wait, but the ten golden coins still remained intact. it was a busy thoroughfare, with a church on one side of my house and an hotel on the other. the days passed pleasantly enough, for it was a lovely warm autumn, and i sat in the window of my consulting-room screened by the rather dingy curtain which i had put up, and watched the passing crowd or read my book, for i had spent part of my scanty funds on making myself a member of a circulating library. in spite of my sparse food, or more probably on account of it, i was extraordinarily fit and well, so that at night when all hope of patients was gone for that day i would lock up my house and walk many miles to work off my energy. with its imperial associations it is a glorious place and even now if i had to live in a town outside london it is surely to southsea, the residential quarter of portsmouth, that i would turn. the history of the past carries on into the history of to-day, the new torpedo-boat flies past the old _victory_ with the same white ensign flying from each, and the old elizabethan culverins and sakers can still be seen in the same walk which brings you to the huge artillery of the forts. there is a great glamour there to any one with the historic sense--a sense which i drank in with my mother’s milk. it had never entered my head yet that literature might give me a career, or anything beyond a little casual pocket money, but already it was a deciding factor in my life, for i could not have held on, and must have either starved or given in but for the few pounds which mr. hogg sent me, for they enabled all other smaller sums to be spent in nourishment. i have wondered sometimes as i look back that i did not contract scurvy, for most of my food was potted, and i had no means of cooking vegetables. however, i felt no grievance at the time nor any particular perception that my mode of life was unusual, nor indeed any particular anxiety about the future. at that age everything seems an adventure--and there was always the novel pleasure of the house. once i had a moment of weakness during which i answered an advertisement which asked for a doctor to attend coolies in the tea gardens of the terai. i spent a few unsettled days waiting for an answer, but none came and i settled down once more to my waiting and hoping. i had one avenue of success open of which i could not avail myself. my catholic relatives had sent me introductions to the bishop and i was assured that there was no catholic doctor in the town. my mind, however, was so perfectly clear and i had so entirely broken away from the old faith that i could not possibly use it for material ends. i therefore burned the letter of introduction. as the weeks passed and i had no one with whom to talk i began to think wistfully of the home circle at edinburgh, and to wonder why, with my eight-roomed house, one or more of them should not come to keep me company. the girls were already governessing or preparing to do so, but there was my little brother innes. it would relieve my mother and yet help me if he could join me. so it was arranged, and one happy evening the little knicker-bockered fellow, just ten years old, joined me as my comrade. no man could have had a merrier and brighter one. in a few weeks we had settled down to a routine life, i having found a good day-school for him. the soldiers of portsmouth were already a great joy to him, and his future career was marked out by his natural tastes, for he was a born leader and administrator. little did i foresee that he would win distinction in the greatest of all wars, and die in the prime of his manhood--but not before he knew that complete victory had been attained. even then our thoughts were very military, and i remember how we waited together outside the office of the local paper that we might learn the result of the bombardment of alexandria. turning over some old papers after these pages were written i came upon a letter written in straggling schoolboy script by my little brother to his mother at home which may throw an independent light upon those curious days. it is dated august 16, 1882. he says: “the patients are crowding in. we have made three bob this week. we have vaxenated a baby and got hold of a man with consumtion, and to-day a gipsy’s cart came up to the door selling baskets and chairs so we determined not to let the man ring as long as he liked. after he had rong two or three times arthur yelled out at the pitch of his voice, go a way but the man rang again so i went down to the door and pulled open the letter box and cried out go a way. the man began to swere at me and say that he wanted to see arthur. all this time arthur thought that the door was open and was yelling shut that door. then i came upstairs and told arthur what the man had said so arthur went down and opened the door and found out that the gipsy’s child had measles.... after all we got sixpence out of them and that is all ways something.” i remember the incident well, and certainly my sudden change of tone from the indignant householder, who is worried by a tramp, to my best bedside manner in the hopes of a fee, must have been very amusing. my recollection is, however, that it was the gipsy who got sixpence out of us. for some time innes and i lived entirely alone, doing the household tasks between us, and going long walks in the evening to keep ourselves fit. then i had a brain-wave and i put an advertisement in the evening paper that a groundfloor was to let in exchange for services. i had numerous applicants in reply, and out of them i chose two elderly women who claimed to be sisters--a claim which they afterwards failed to make good. when once they were installed we became quite a civilized household and things began to look better. there were complex quarrels, however, and one of the women left. the other soon afterwards followed suit. as the first woman had seemed to me to be the most efficient, i followed her up and found that she had started a small shop. her rent was weekly, so that was easily settled, but she talked gloomily about her stock. “i will buy everything in your shop,” i said in a large way. it cost me exactly seventeen and sixpence, and i was loaded up for many months with matches, cakes of blacking and other merchandise. from then onwards our meals were cooked for us, and we became in all ways normal. month followed month and i picked up a patient here and a patient there until the nucleus of a little practice had been formed. sometimes it was an accident, sometimes an emergency case, sometimes a newcomer to the town or one who had quarrelled with his doctor. i mixed with people so far as i could, for i learned that a brass plate alone will never attract, and people must see the human being who lies in wait behind it. some of my tradespeople gave me their custom in return for mine, and mine was so small that i was likely to have the best of the bargain. there was a grocer who developed epileptic fits, which meant butter and tea to us. poor fellow, he could never have realized the mixed feelings with which i received the news of a fresh outbreak. then there was a very tall, horse-faced old lady with an extraordinary dignity of bearing. she would sit framed in the window of her little house, like the picture of a _grande dame_ of the old régime. but every now and again she went on a wild burst, in the course of which she would skim plates out of the window at the passers-by. i was the only one who had influence over her at such times, for she was a haughty, autocratic old person. once she showed an inclination to skim a plate at me also, but i quelled her by assuming a gloomy dignity as portentous as her own. she had some art treasures which she heaped upon me when she was what we will politely call “ill,” but claimed back again the moment she was well. once when she had been particularly troublesome i retained a fine lava jug, in spite of her protests, and i have got it yet. it is well that medical practice has its humorous side, for it has much to depress one. most men never use their reasoning power at all on the religious side, but if they did they would find it difficult sometimes to reconcile the sights which a physician sees with the idea of a merciful providence. if one loses the explanation that this life is a spiritual chastening for another, and thinks that death ends all, and that this is our one experience, then it is impossible to sustain the goodness or the omnipotence of god. so i felt at the time, and it made me a materialist, but now i know well that i was judging a story on the strength of one chapter. let me give an example. i was called in by a poor woman to see her daughter. as i entered the humble sitting-room there was a small cot at one side, and by the gesture of the mother i understood that the sufferer was there. i picked up a candle and walking over i stooped over the little bed, expecting to see a child. what i really saw was a pair of brown sullen eyes, full of loathing and pain, which looked up in resentment to mine. i could not tell how old the creature was. long thin limbs were twisted and coiled in the tiny couch. the face was sane but malignant. “what is it?” i asked in dismay when we were out of hearing. “it’s a girl,” sobbed the mother. “she’s nineteen. oh! if god would only take her!” what a life for both! and how hard to face such facts and accept any of the commonplace explanations of existence! medical life is full of dangers and pitfalls, and luck must always play its part in a man’s career. many a good man has been ruined by pure bad luck. on one occasion i was called in to a lady who was suffering from what appeared to be dyspepsia of a rather severe type. there was absolutely nothing to indicate anything more serious. i therefore reassured the family, spoke lightly of the illness, and walked home to make up a bismuth mixture for her, calling on one or two other cases on the way. when i got home i found a messenger waiting to say that the lady was dead. this is the sort of thing which may happen to any man at any time. it did not hurt me, for i was too lowly to be hurt. you can’t ruin a practice when there is no practice. the woman really had a gastric ulcer, for which there is no diagnosis; it was eating its way into the lining of her stomach, it pierced an artery after i saw her, and she bled to death. nothing could have saved her, and i think her relatives came to understand this. i made £154 the first year, and £250 the second, rising slowly to £300, which in eight years i never passed, so far as the medical practice went. in the first year the income tax paper arrived and i filled it up to show that i was not liable. they returned the paper with “most unsatisfactory” scrawled across it. i wrote “i entirely agree” under the words, and returned it once more. for this little bit of cheek i was had up before the assessors, and duly appeared with my ledger under my arm. they could make nothing, however, out of me or my ledger, and we parted with mutual laughter and compliments. in the year 1885 my brother left me to go to a public school in yorkshire. shortly afterwards i was married. a lady named mrs. hawkins, a widow of a gloucestershire family, had come to southsea with her son and daughter, the latter a very gentle and amiable girl. i was brought into contact with them through the illness of the son, which was of a sudden and violent nature, arising from cerebral meningitis. as the mother was very awkwardly situated in lodgings, i volunteered to furnish an extra bedroom in my house and give the poor lad, who was in the utmost danger, my personal attention. his case was a mortal one, and in spite of all i could do he passed away a few days later. such a death under my own roof naturally involved me in a good deal of anxiety and trouble--indeed, if i had not had the foresight to ask a medical friend to see him with me on the day before he passed away, i should have been in a difficult position. the funeral was from my house. the family were naturally grieved at the worry to which they had quite innocently exposed me, and so our relations became intimate and sympathetic, which ended in the daughter consenting to share my fortunes. we were married on august 6, 1885, and no man could have had a more gentle and amiable life’s companion. our union was marred by the sad ailment which came after a very few years to cast its shadow over our lives, but it comforts me to think that during the time when we were together there was no single occasion when our affection was disturbed by any serious breach or division, the credit of which lies entirely with her own quiet philosophy, which enabled her to bear with smiling patience not only her own sad illness, which lasted so long, but all those other vicissitudes which life brings with it. i rejoice to think that though she married a penniless doctor, she was spared long enough to fully appreciate the pleasure and the material comforts which worldly success was able to bring us. she had some small income of her own which enabled me to expand my simple housekeeping in a way which gave her from the first the decencies, if not the luxuries, of life. in many ways my marriage marked a turning-point in my life. a bachelor, especially one who had been a wanderer like myself, drifts easily into bohemian habits, and i was no exception. i cannot look back upon those years with any spiritual satisfaction, for i was still in the valley of darkness. i had ceased to butt my head incessantly against what seemed to be an impenetrable wall, and i had resigned myself to ignorance upon that which is the most momentous question in life--for a voyage is bleak indeed if one has no conception to what port one is bound. i had laid aside the old charts as useless, and had quite despaired of ever finding a new one which would enable me to steer an intelligible course, save towards that mist which was all that my pilots, huxley, mill, spencer and others, could see ahead of us. my mental attitude is correctly portrayed in “the stark munro letters.” a dim light of dawn was to come to me soon in an uncertain fitful way which was destined in time to spread and grow brighter. up to now the main interest of my life lay in my medical career. but with the more regular life and the greater sense of responsibility, coupled with the natural development of brainpower, the literary side of me began slowly to spread until it was destined to push the other entirely aside. thus a new phase had begun, part medical, part literary, and part philosophical, which i shall deal with in another chapter. chapter viii my first literary success new outlook--james payn--genesis of holmes--“a study in scarlet”--“micah clarke”--disappointments--andrew lang--cornhill dinner--oscar wilde--his criticism of himself--“the white company.” during the years before my marriage i had from time to time written short stories which were good enough to be marketable at very small prices--£4 on an average--but not good enough to reproduce. they are scattered about amid the pages of “london society,” “all the year round,” “temple bar,” “the boy’s own paper,” and other journals. there let them lie. they served their purpose in relieving me a little of that financial burden which always pressed upon me. i can hardly have earned more than £10 or £15 a year from this source, so that the idea of making a living by it never occurred to me. but though i was not putting out i was taking in. i still have note-books full of all sorts of knowledge which i acquired during that time. it is a great mistake to start putting out cargo when you have hardly stowed any on board. my own slow methods and natural limitations made me escape this danger. after my marriage, however, my brain seems to have quickened and both my imagination and my range of expression were greatly improved. most of the short stories which appeared eventually in my “captain of the polestar” were written in those years from 1885 to 1890. some of them are perhaps as good honest work as any that i have done. what gave me great pleasure and for the first time made me realize that i was ceasing to be a hack writer and was getting into good company was when james payn accepted my short story “habakuk jephson’s statement” for “cornhill.” i had a reverence for this splendid magazine with its traditions from thackeray to stevenson and the thought that i had won my way into it pleased me even more than the cheque for £30, which came duly to hand. it was, of course, anonymous,--such was the law of the magazine--which protects the author from abuse as well as prevents his winning fame. one paper began its review by the phrase “‘cornhill’ opens its new number with a story which would have made thackeray turn in his grave.” a dear old gentleman who knew me hurried across the road to show me the paper with these cheering words. another, more gracious, said “‘cornhill’ begins the new year with an exceedingly powerful story in which we seem to trace the hand of the author of ‘the new arabian nights’.” it was great praise, but something less warm, which came straight to my own address, would have pleased me better. i soon had two other stories in the “cornhill”--“john huxford’s hiatus” and “the ring of thoth.” i also penetrated the stout scottish barrier of “blackwood” with a story, “the physiologist’s wife,” which was written when i was under the influence of henry james. but i was still in the days of very small things--so small that when a paper sent me a woodcut and offered me four guineas if i would write a story to correspond i was not too proud to accept. it was a very bad woodcut and i think that the story corresponded all right. i remember writing a new zealand story, though why i should have written about a place of which i knew nothing i cannot imagine. some new zealand critic pointed out that i had given the exact bearings of the farm mentioned as 90 miles to the east or west of the town of nelson, and that in that case it was situated 20 miles out on the floor of the pacific ocean. these little things will happen. there are times when accuracy is necessary and others where the idea is everything and the place quite immaterial. it was about a year after my marriage that i realized that i could go on doing short stories for ever and never make headway. what is necessary is that your name should be on the back of a volume. only so do you assert your individuality, and get the full credit or discredit of your achievement. i had for some time from 1884 onwards been engaged upon a sensational book of adventure which i had called “the firm of girdlestone,” which represented my first attempt at a connected narrative. save for occasional patches it is a worthless book, and, like the first book of everyone else, unless he is a great original genius, it was too reminiscent of the work of others. i could see it then, and could see it even more clearly later. when i sent it to publishers and they scorned it i quite acquiesced in their decision and finally let it settle, after its periodical flights to town, a dishevelled mass of manuscript at the back of a drawer. i felt now that i was capable of something fresher and crisper and more workmanlike. gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dovetailing of his plots, and poe’s masterful detective, m. dupin, had from boyhood been one of my heroes. but could i bring an addition of my own? i thought of my old teacher joe bell, of his eagle face, of his curious ways, of his eerie trick of spotting details. if he were a detective he would surely reduce this fascinating but unorganized business to something nearer to an exact science. i would try if i could get this effect. it was surely possible in real life, so why should i not make it plausible in fiction? it is all very well to say that a man is clever, but the reader wants to see examples of it--such examples as bell gave us every day in the wards. the idea amused me. what should i call the fellow? i still possess the leaf of a notebook with various alternative names. one rebelled against the elementary art which gives some inkling of character in the name, and creates mr. sharps or mr. ferrets. first it was sherringford holmes; then it was sherlock holmes. he could not tell his own exploits, so he must have a commonplace comrade as a foil--an educated man of action who could both join in the exploits and narrate them. a drab, quiet name for this unostentatious man. watson would do. and so i had my puppets and wrote my “study in scarlet.” i knew that the book was as good as i could make it, and i had high hopes. when “girdlestone” used to come circling back with the precision of a homing pigeon, i was grieved but not surprised, for i acquiesced in the decision. but when my little holmes book began also to do the circular tour i was hurt, for i knew that it deserved a better fate. james payn applauded but found it both too short and too long, which was true enough. arrowsmith received it in may, 1886, and returned it unread in july. two or three others sniffed and turned away. finally, as ward, lock & co. made a specialty of cheap and often sensational literature, i sent it to them. “dear sir,” they said,--“we have read your story and are pleased with it. we could not publish it this year as the market is flooded at present with cheap fiction, but if you do not object to its being held over till next year, we will give you £25 for the copyright. “yours faithfully “ward, lock & co.” “_oct. 30, 1886._” it was not a very tempting offer, and even i, poor as i was, hesitated to accept it. it was not merely the small sum offered, but it was the long delay, for this book might open a road for me. i was heart-sick, however, at repeated disappointments, and i felt that perhaps it was true wisdom to make sure of publicity, however late. therefore i accepted, and the book became “beeton’s xmas annual” of 1887. ward lock made a wonderful bargain, for they not only had their christmas number but they brought out numerous editions of the book, and finally they even had the valuable cinema rights for this paltry payment. i never at any time received another penny for it from this firm, so i do not feel that i need be grateful even if it so chanced that they cleared my path in life. having a long wait in front of me before this book could appear, and feeling large thoughts rise within me, i now determined to test my powers to the full, and i chose a historical novel for this end, because it seemed to me the one way of combining a certain amount of literary dignity with those scenes of action and adventure which were natural to my young and ardent mind. i had always felt great sympathy for the puritans, who, after all, whatever their little peculiarities, did represent political liberty and earnestness in religion. they had usually been caricatured in fiction and art. even scott had not drawn them as they were. macaulay, who was always one of my chief inspirations, had alone made them comprehensible--the sombre fighters, with their bibles and their broadswords. there is a great passage of his--i cannot quote it verbally--in which he says that after the restoration if ever you saw a carter more intelligent than his fellows, or a peasant who tilled his land better, you would be likely to find that it was an old pikeman of cromwell’s. this, then, was my inspiration in “micah clarke,” where i fairly let myself go upon the broad highway of adventure. i was well up in history, but i spent some months over details and then wrote the book very rapidly. there are bits of it, the picture of the puritan household, and the sketch of judge jeffreys, which i have never bettered. when it was finished early in 1888 my hopes ran high and out it went on its travels. but, alas! although my holmes booklet was out, and had attracted some little favourable comment, the door still seemed to be barred. james payn had first peep, and he began his letter of rejection with the sentence “how can you, can you, waste your time and your wits writing historical novels!” this was depressing after a year of work. then came bentley’s verdict: “it lacks in our opinion the one great necessary point for fiction, i.e. interest; and this being the case we do not think it could ever become popular with libraries and the general public.” then blackwood had its say: “there are imperfections which would militate against success. the chances of the book proving a popular success do not seem to be strong enough to warrant us in publishing it.” there were others even more depressing. i was on the point of putting the worn manuscript into hospital with its mangled brother “girdlestone” when as a last resource, i sent it to longmans, whose reader, andrew lang, liked it and advised its acceptance. it was to “andrew of the brindled hair,” as stevenson called him, that i owe my first real opening, and i have never forgotten it. the book duly appeared in february, 1889, and though it was not a boom book it had extraordinarily good reviews, including one special one all to itself by mr. prothero in the “nineteenth century,” and it has sold without intermission from that day to this. it was the first solid corner-stone laid for some sort of literary reputation. british literature had a considerable vogue in the united states at this time for the simple reason that there was no copyright and they had not to pay for it. it was hard on british authors, but far harder on american ones, since they were exposed to this devastating competition. like all national sins it brought its own punishment not only to american authors, who were guiltless, but to the publishers themselves, for what belongs to everyone belongs practically to no one, and they could not bring out a decent edition without being at once undersold. i have seen some of my early american editions which might have been printed on the paper that shopmen use for parcels. one good result, however, from my point of view was that a british author, if he had anything in him, soon won recognition in america, and afterwards, when the copyright act was passed, he had his audience all ready for him. my holmes book had met with some american success and presently i learned that an agent of lippincott’s was in london and that he wished to see me, to arrange for a book. needless to say that i gave my patients a rest for a day and eagerly kept the appointment. once only before had i touched the edge of literary society. that was when “cornhill” was turned into a fully illustrated journal, an experiment which failed for it was quickly abandoned. the change was celebrated by a dinner at the ship, at greenwich, to which i was invited on the strength of my short contributions. all the authors and artists were there, and i remember the reverence with which i approached james payn, who was to me the warden of the sacred gate. i was among the first arrivals, and was greeted by mr. smith, the head of the firm, who introduced me to payn. i loved much of his work and waited in awe for the first weighty remark which should fall from his lips. it was that there was a crack in the window and he wondered how the devil it had got there. let me add, however, that my future experience was to show that there was no wittier or more delightful companion in the world. i sat next to anstey that night, who had just made a most deserved hit with his “vice versa,” and i was introduced to other celebrities, so that i came back walking on air. now for the second time i was in london on literary business. stoddart, the american, proved to be an excellent fellow, and had two others to dinner. they were gill, a very entertaining irish m.p., and oscar wilde, who was already famous as the champion of æstheticism. it was indeed a golden evening for me. wilde to my surprise had read “micah clarke” and was enthusiastic about it, so that i did not feel a complete outsider. his conversation left an indelible impression upon my mind. he towered above us all, and yet had the art of seeming to be interested in all that we could say. he had delicacy of feeling and tact, for the monologue man, however clever, can never be a gentleman at heart. he took as well as gave, but what he gave was unique. he had a curious precision of statement, a delicate flavour of humour, and a trick of small gestures to illustrate his meaning, which were peculiar to himself. the effect cannot be reproduced, but i remember how in discussing the wars of the future he said: “a chemist on each side will approach the frontier with a bottle”--his upraised hand and precise face conjuring up a vivid and grotesque picture. his anecdotes, too, were happy and curious. we were discussing the cynical maxim that the good fortune of our friends made us discontented. “the devil,” said wilde, “was once crossing the libyan desert, and he came upon a spot where a number of small fiends were tormenting a holy hermit. the sainted man easily shook off their evil suggestions. the devil watched their failure and then he stepped forward to give them a lesson. ‘what you do is too crude,’ said he. ‘permit me for one moment.’ with that he whispered to the holy man, ‘your brother has just been made bishop of alexandria.’ a scowl of malignant jealousy at once clouded the serene face of the hermit. ‘that,’ said the devil to his imps, ‘is the sort of thing which i should recommend.’” the result of the evening was that both wilde and i promised to write books for “lippincott’s magazine”--wilde’s contribution was “the picture of dorian grey,” a book which is surely upon a high moral plane, while i wrote “the sign of four,” in which holmes made his second appearance. i should add that never in wilde’s conversation did i observe one trace of coarseness of thought, nor could one at that time associate him with such an idea. only once again did i see him, many years afterwards, and then he gave me the impression of being mad. he asked me, i remember, if i had seen some play of his which was running. i answered that i had not. he said: “ah, you must go. it is wonderful. it is genius!” all this with the gravest face. nothing could have been more different from his early gentlemanly instincts. i thought at the time, and still think, that the monstrous development which ruined him was pathological, and that a hospital rather than a police court was the place for its consideration. when his little book came out i wrote to say what i thought of it. his letter is worth reproducing, as showing the true wilde. i omit the early part in which he comments on my own work in too generous terms. “between me and life there is a mist of words always. i throw probability out of the window for the sake of a phrase, and the chance of an epigram makes me desert truth. still i do aim at making a work of art, and i am really delighted that you think my treatment subtle and artistically good. the newspapers seem to me to be written by the prurient for the philistine. i cannot understand how they can treat ‘dorian grey’ as immoral. my difficulty was to keep the inherent moral subordinate to the artistic and dramatic effect, and it still seems to me that the moral is too obvious.” encouraged by the kind reception which “micah clarke” had received from the critics, i now determined upon an even bolder and more ambitious flight. it seemed to me that the days of edward iii constituted the greatest epoch in english history--an epoch when both the french and the scottish kings were prisoners in london. this result had been brought about mainly by the powers of a body of men who were renowned through europe but who had never been drawn in british literature, for though scott treated in his inimitable way the english archer, it was as an outlaw rather than as a soldier that he drew him. i had some views of my own, too, about the middle ages which i was anxious to set forth. i was familiar with froissart and chaucer and i was aware that the famous knights of old were by no means the athletic heroes of scott, but were often of a very different type. hence came my two books “the white company,” written in 1889, and “sir nigel,” written fourteen years later. of the two i consider the latter the better book, but i have no hesitation in saying that the two of them taken together did thoroughly achieve my purpose, that they made an accurate picture of that great age, and that as a single piece of work they form the most complete, satisfying and ambitious thing that i have ever done. all things find their level, but i believe that if i had never touched holmes, who has tended to obscure my higher work, my position in literature would at the present moment be a more commanding one. the work needed much research and i have still got my notebooks full of all sorts of lore. i cultivate a simple style and avoid long words so far as possible, and it may be that this surface of ease has sometimes caused the reader to underrate the amount of real research which lies in all my historical novels. it is not a matter which troubles me, however, for i have always felt that justice is done in the end, and that the real merit of any work is never permanently lost. i remember that as i wrote the last words of “the white company” i felt a wave of exultation and with a cry of “that’s done it!” i hurled my inky pen across the room, where it left a black smudge upon the duck’s-egg wall-paper. i knew in my heart that the book would live and that it would illuminate our national traditions. now that it has passed through fifty editions i suppose i may say with all modesty that my forecast has proved to be correct. this was the last book which i wrote in my days of doctoring at southsea, and marks an epoch in my life, so i can now hark back to some other phases of my last years at bush villa before i broke away into a new existence. i will only add that “the white company” was accepted by “cornhill,” in spite of james payn’s opinion of historical novels, and that i fulfilled another ambition by having a serial in that famous magazine. a new phase of medical experience came to me about this time, for i suddenly found myself a unit in the british army. the operations in the east had drained the medical service, and it had therefore been determined that local civilian doctors should be enrolled for temporary duty of some hours a day. the terms were a guinea a day, and a number of us were tempted to volunteer where there were only a few vacancies. when i was called before the board of selection a savage-looking old army doctor who presided barked out, “and you, sir--what are you prepared to do?” to which i answered, “anything.” it seems that the others had all been making bargains and reservations, so my wholehearted reply won the job. it brought me into closer contact with the savage-looking medico, who proved to be sir anthony home, v.c.--an honour which he had won in the indian mutiny. he was in supreme charge, and as he was as fierce in speech and in act as in appearance, everyone was terrified of him. on one occasion i had told the orderly to draw a man’s tooth, knowing that he was a very much more skilful dentist than i. i was on my way home when i was overtaken by an excited soldier who told me that sergeant jones was being court-martialled and would certainly lose his stripes because he had done a minor operation. i hurried back and on entering the room found sir anthony glaring at the unhappy man, while several other orderlies stood round awaiting their own turn. sir anthony’s glare was transferred to me when i said that whatever the sergeant had done was by my express order. he grunted, banged the book he was holding, and broke up the meeting. he seemed a most disagreeable old man, and yet when i was married shortly afterwards he sent me a most charming message wishing me good fortune. up to then i had never had anything from him save a scowl from his thick eyebrows, so i was most agreeably surprised. soon afterwards the pressure ceased and we civilians were all dismissed. chapter ix pulling up the anchor psychic studies--experiments in telepathy--my first séances--a curious test--general drayson--opinion on theosophy--a. p. sinnett--w. t. stead--journey to berlin--koch’s treatment--brutality of bergmann--malcolm morris--literary society--political work--arthur balfour--our departure. it was in these years after my marriage and before leaving southsea that i planted the first seeds of those psychic studies which were destined to revolutionize my views and to absorb finally all the energies of my life. i had at that time the usual contempt which the young educated man feels towards the whole subject which has been covered by the clumsy name of spiritualism. i had read of mediums being convicted of fraud, i had heard of phenomena which were opposed to every known scientific law, and i had deplored the simplicity and credulity which could deceive good, earnest people into believing that such bogus happenings were signs of intelligence outside our own existence. educated as i had been during my most plastic years in the school of medical materialism, and soaked in the negative views of all my great teachers, i had no room in my brain for theories which cut right across every fixed conclusion that i had formed. i was wrong and my great teachers were wrong, but still i hold that they wrought well and that their victorian agnosticism was in the interests of the human race, for it shook the old iron-clad unreasoning evangelical position which was so universal before their days. for all rebuilding a site must be cleared. there were two separate victorian movements towards change, the one an attempt to improve the old building and make it good enough to carry on--as shown in the oxford and high church development, the other a knocking down of ruins which could only end in some fresh erection springing up. as i have shown my own position was that of a respectful materialist who entirely admitted a great central intelligent cause, without being able to distinguish what that cause was, or why it should work in so mysterious and terrible a way in bringing its designs to fulfilment. from my point of view the mind (and so far as i could see the soul, which was the total effect of all the hereditary or personal functionings of the mind) was an emanation from the brain and entirely physical in its nature. i saw, as a medical man, how a spicule of bone or a tumour pressing on the brain would cause what seemed an alteration in the soul. i saw also how drugs or alcohol would turn on fleeting phases of virtue or vice. the physical argument seemed an overpowering one. it had never struck me that the current of events might really flow in the opposite direction, and that the higher faculties could only manifest themselves imperfectly through an imperfect instrument. the broken fiddle is silent and yet the musician is the same as ever. the first thing which steadied me and made me reconsider my position was the question of telepathy, which was already being discussed by william barrett and others, even before the appearance of myers’ monumental work on “human personality”--the first book which devoted to these psychic subjects the deep study and sustained brain power which they demand. it may, in my opinion, take a permanent place in human literature like the “novum organum” or “the descent of man” or any other great root-book which has marked a date in human thought. having read some of the evidence i began to experiment in thought transference, and i found a fellow-researcher in mr. ball, a well-known architect in the town. again and again, sitting behind him, i have drawn diagrams, and he in turn has made approximately the same figure. i showed beyond any doubt whatever that i could convey my thought without words. but if i could verify such conclusions up to six feet i could not well doubt them when they gave me the evidence that the same results could be obtained at a distance. with an appropriate subject, and some undefined sympathy between the two individuals, it was independent of space. so the evidence seemed to show. i had always sworn by science and by the need of fearless following wherever truth might lie. it was clear now that my position had been too rigid. i had compared the thought-excretion of the brain to the bile-excretion of the liver. clearly this was untenable. if thought could go a thousand miles and produce a perceptible effect then it differed entirely not only in degree but in kind from any purely physical material. that seemed certain, and it must involve some modification of my old views. about this time (1886) the family of a general whom i attended professionally became interested in table turning and asked me to come and check their results. they sat round a dining-room table which after a time, their hands being upon it, began to sway and finally got sufficient motion to tap with one leg. they then asked questions and received answers, more or less wise and more or less to the point. they were got by the tedious process of reciting the alphabet and writing down the letter which the tap indicated. it seemed to me that we were collectively pushing the table, and that our wills were concerned in bringing down the leg at the right moment. i was interested but very sceptical. some of these messages were not vague platitudes but were definite and from dead friends of the family, which naturally impressed them greatly, though it had not the same effect upon me, since i did not know them. i have the old records before me as i write. “don’t tell the girls when you see them, but they will talk about me. kiss my baby for me. i watch her always. francie.” this was the style of message, mixed up with a good many platitudes. we held twenty or more of such meetings, but i never received anything evidential to my own address, and i was very critical as to the whole proceedings. none the less there was a problem to be solved and i went on with its solution, reading the pros and the cons, and asking advice from those who had experience, especially from general drayson, a very distinguished thinker and a pioneer of psychic knowledge, who lived at that time at southsea. i had known drayson first as an astronomer, for he had worked out a revolutionary idea by which there is a fatal mistake in our present idea as to the circle which is described in the heavens by the prolonged axis of the earth. it is really a wider circle round a different centre, and this correction enables us to explain several things now inexplicable, and to make astronomy a more exact science, with certain very important reactions upon geology and the recurrent glacial epochs, the exact date of which could be fixed. his views impressed me much at the time, and several books upholding them have appeared since his death, notably “draysoniana” by admiral de horsey. if he makes good, as i think he will, drayson will make a great permanent name. his opinion therefore was not negligible upon any subject, and when he told me his views and experiences on spiritualism i could not fail to be impressed, though my own philosophy was far too solid to be easily destroyed. i was too poor to employ professional mediums, and to work on such subjects without a medium is as if one worked at astronomy without a telescope. once only an old man with some reputed psychic power came for a small fee and gave us a demonstration. he went into a loud-breathing trance to the alarm of his audience, and then gave each of us a test. mine was certainly a very remarkable one, for it was “do not read leigh hunt’s book.” i was hesitating at the time whether i should read his “comic dramatists of the restoration” or not, for on the one hand it is literature and on the other the treatment repelled me. this then was a very final and excellent test so far as telepathy went, but i would not fully grant that it was more. i was so impressed, however, that i wrote an account of it to “light,” the psychic weekly paper, and so in the year 1887 i actually put myself on public record as a student of these matters. that was thirty-seven years ago, as i write, so i am a very senior student now. from that time onwards i read and thought a great deal, though it was not until the later phase of my life that i realized whither all this was tending. this question i will treat in a final section by itself, so that those to whom it is of less interest can avoid it. i was deeply interested and attracted for a year or two by theosophy, because while spiritualism seemed at that time to be chaos so far as philosophy went, theosophy presented a very well thought-out and reasonable scheme, parts of which, notably reincarnation and karma, seemed to offer an explanation for some of the anomalies of life. i read sinnett’s “occult world” and afterwards with even greater admiration i read his fine exposition of theosophy in “esoteric buddhism,” a most notable book. i also met him, for he was an old friend of general drayson’s, and i was impressed by his conversation. shortly afterwards, however, there appeared dr. hodgson’s report upon his investigation into madame blavatsky’s proceedings at adyar, which shook my confidence very much. it is true that mrs. besant has since then published a powerful defence which tends to show that hodgson may have been deceived, but the subsequent book “a priestess of isis” which contains many of her own letters leaves an unpleasant impression, and sinnett’s posthumous work seems to show that he also had lost confidence. on the other hand colonel olcott shows that the woman undoubtedly had real psychic powers, whatever their source. as to spiritualism it seems to have only interested her in its lower phenomenal aspect. her books show extraordinary erudition and capacity for hard work, even if they represent the transfer of other people’s conclusions, as they frequently do. it would be unjust, however, to condemn the old wisdom simply because it was introduced by this extraordinary and volcanic person. we have also had in our branch of the occult many dishonest mediums, but we have hastened to unveil them where we could do so, and theosophy will be in a stronger position when it shakes off madame blavatsky altogether. in any case it could never have met my needs for i ask for severe proof, and if i have to go back to unquestioning faith i should find myself in the fold from which i wandered. my life had been a pleasant one with my steadily-increasing literary success, my practice, which was enough to keep me pleasantly occupied, and my sport, which i treat in a later chapter. suddenly, however, there came a development which shook me out of my rut, and caused an absolute change in my life and plans. one daughter, mary, had been born to us, our household was a happy one, and as i have never had personal ambitions, since the simple things of life have always been the most pleasant to me, it is possible that i should have remained in southsea permanently but for this new episode in my life. it arose when in 1890 koch announced that he had discovered a sure cure for consumption and that he would demonstrate it upon a certain date in berlin. a great urge came upon me suddenly that i should go to berlin and see him do so. i could give no clear reason for this but it was an irresistible impulse and i at once determined to go. had i been a well-known doctor or a specialist in consumption it would have been more intelligible, but i had, as a matter of fact, no great interest in the more recent developments of my own profession, and a very strong belief that much of the so-called progress was illusory. however, at a few hours’ notice i packed up a bag and started off alone upon this curious adventure. i had had an interchange of letters with mr. w. t. stead over some matter and i called upon him at the “review of reviews” office as i passed through london to ask him if he could give me an introduction to koch or to dr. bergmann, who was to give the demonstration. mr. stead was very amiable to this big unknown provincial doctor, and he gave me a letter for the british ambassador--sir edward malet, if i remember right--and for mr. lowe, “the times” correspondent. he also asked me to do a character sketch of koch for him, adding that he would have count mattei as a feature of his magazine this month and koch the next. i said, “then you will have the greatest man of science and the greatest quack in europe following each other.” stead glared at me angrily, for it seems that the mattei treatment with its blue electricity and the rest of it was at that moment his particular fad. however, we parted amiably and all through his life we kept in distant touch, though we came into sharp collision at the time of the boer war. he was a brave and honest man, and if he was impulsive at times it was only the sudden outflame of that fire which made him the great force for good that he was. in psychic knowledge he was a generation before his time, though his mode of expressing it may sometimes have been injudicious. i went on to berlin that night and found myself in the continental express with a very handsome and courteous london physician bound upon the same errand as myself. we passed most of the night talking and i learned that his name was malcolm morris and that he also had been a provincial doctor, but that he had come to london and had made a considerable hit as a skin specialist in harley street. it was the beginning of a friendship which endured. having arrived at berlin the great thing was to be present at bergmann’s demonstration, which was to be next day at twelve. i went to our ambassador, was kept long waiting, had a chilly reception and was dismissed without help or consolation. then i tried “the times” correspondent, but he could not help me either. he and his amiable wife showed me every courtesy and invited me to dinner that night. tickets were simply not to be had and neither money nor interest could procure them. i conceived the wild idea of getting one from koch himself and made my way to his house. while there i had the curious experience of seeing his mail arrive--a large sack full of letters, which was emptied out on the floor of the hall, and exhibited every sort of stamp in europe. it was a sign of all the sad broken lives and wearied hearts which were turning in hope to berlin. koch remained a veiled prophet, however, and would see neither me nor any one else. i was fairly at my wit’s ends and could not imagine how i could attain my end. next day i went down to the great building where the address was to be given and managed by bribing the porter to get into the outer hall. the huge audience was assembling in a room beyond. i tried further bribing that i might be slipped in, but the official became abusive. people streamed past me, but i was always the waiter at the gate. finally every one had gone in and then a group of men came bustling across, bergmann, bearded and formidable, in the van, with a tail of house surgeons and satellites behind him. i threw myself across his path. “i have come a thousand miles,” said i. “may i not come in?” he halted and glared at me through his spectacles. “perhaps you would like to take my place,” he roared, working himself up into that strange folly of excitement which seems so strange in the heavy german nature. “that is the only place left. yes, yes, take my place by all means. my classes are filled with englishmen already.” he fairly spat out the word “englishmen” and i learned afterwards that some recent quarrel with morel mackenzie over the illness of the emperor frederick had greatly incensed him. i am glad to say that i kept my temper and my polite manner, which is always the best shield when one is met by brutal rudeness. “not at all,” i said. “i would not intrude, if there was really no room.” he glared at me again, all beard and spectacles, and rushed on with his court all grinning at the snub which the presumptuous englishman had received. one of them lingered, however--a kindly american. “that was bad behaviour,” said he. “see here! if you meet me at four this afternoon i will show you my full notes of the lecture, and i know the cases he is about to show, so we can see them together to-morrow.” then he followed on. so it came about that i attained my end after all, but in a roundabout way. i studied the lecture and the cases, and i had the temerity to disagree with every one and to come to the conclusion that the whole thing was experimental and premature. a wave of madness had seized the world and from all parts, notably from england, poor afflicted people were rushing to berlin for a cure, some of them in such advanced stages of disease that they died in the train. i felt so sure of my ground and so strongly about it that i wrote a letter of warning to “the daily telegraph,” and i rather think that this letter was the very first which appeared upon the side of doubt and caution. i need not say that the event proved the truth of my forecast. two days later i was back in southsea, but i came back a changed man. i had spread my wings and had felt something of the powers within me. especially i had been influenced by a long talk with malcolm morris, in which he assured me that i was wasting my life in the provinces and had too small a field for my activities. he insisted that i should leave general practice and go to london. i answered that i was by no means sure of my literary success as yet, and that i could not so easily abandon the medical career which had cost my mother such sacrifices and myself so many years of study. he asked me if there was any special branch of the profession on which i could concentrate so as to get away from general practice. i said that of late years i had been interested in eye work and had amused myself by correcting refractions and ordering glasses in the portsmouth eye hospital under mr. vernon ford. “well,” said morris, “why not specialize upon the eye? go to vienna, put in six months’ work, come back and start in london. thus you will have a nice clean life with plenty of leisure for your literature.” i came home with this great suggestion buzzing in my head and as my wife was quite willing and mary, my little girl, was old enough now to be left with her grandmother, there seemed to be no obstacle in the way. there were no difficulties about disposing of the practice, for it was so small and so purely personal that it could not be sold to another and simply had to dissolve. the portsmouth literary and scientific society gave me a god-speed banquet. i have many pleasant and some comic reminiscences of this society, of which i had been secretary for several years. we kept the sacred flame burning in the old city with our weekly papers and discussions during the long winters. it was there i learned to face an audience, which proved to be of the first importance for my life’s work. i was naturally of a very nervous, backward, self-distrustful disposition in such things and i have been told that the signal that i was about to join in the discussion was that the whole long bench on which i sat, with every one on it, used to shake with my emotion. but once up i learned to speak out, to conceal my trepidations, and to choose my phrases. i gave three papers, one on the arctic seas, one on carlyle and one on gibbon. the former gave me a quite unmerited reputation as a sportsman, for i borrowed from a local taxidermist every bird and beast that he possessed which could conceivably find its way into the arctic circle. these i piled upon the lecture table, and the audience, concluding that i had shot them all, looked upon me with great respect. next morning they were back with the taxidermist once more. we had some weird people and incidents at these debates. i remember one very learned discussion on fossils and the age of the strata, which was ended by a cadaverous major-general of the evangelical persuasion who rose and said in a hollow voice that all this speculation was vain, and indeed incomprehensible, since we knew on an authority which could not possibly be questioned that the world was made exactly five thousand eight hundred and ninety years ago. this put the lid on the debate and we all crept home to bed. my political work also caused me to learn to speak. i was what was called a liberal-unionist, that is, a man whose general position was liberal, but who could not see his way to support gladstone’s irish policy. perhaps we were wrong. however, that was my view at the time. i had a dreadful first experience of platform speaking on a large scale, for at a huge meeting at the amphitheatre the candidate, sir william crossman, was delayed, and to prevent a fiasco i was pushed on at a moment’s notice to face an audience of 3,000 people. it was one of the tight corners of my life. i hardly knew myself what i said, but the irish part of me came to my aid and supplied me with a torrent of more or less incoherent words and similes which roused the audience greatly, though it read to me afterwards more like a comic stump speech than a serious political effort. but it was what they wanted and they were mostly on their feet before i finished. i was amazed when i read it next day, and especially the last crowning sentence which was: “england and ireland are wedded together with the sapphire wedding ring of the sea, and what god has placed together let no man pluck asunder.” it was not very good logic but whether it was eloquence or rodomontade i could not even now determine. i was acting secretary when mr. balfour came down to address a great meeting and, as such, when the hall was full, i waited on the curb outside to receive him. presently his carriage drove up and out he stepped, tall, thin and aristocratic. there were two notorious artisans of the other side waiting for him and i warned them not to make trouble. however, the moment balfour appeared one of them opened a huge mouth with the intention of emitting a howl of execration. but it never got out, for i clapped my hand pretty forcibly over the orifice while i held him by the neck with the other hand. his companion hit me on the head with a stick, and was promptly knocked down by one of my companions. meanwhile balfour got safely in, and we two secretaries followed, rather dishevelled after our adventure. i met lord balfour several times in after life but i never told him how i once had my hat smashed in his defence. what with the literary society and the politicians i left a gap behind me in portsmouth and so did my wife, who was universally popular for her amiable and generous character. it was a wrench to us to leave so many good friends. however, towards the end of 1890 the die was cast, and we closed the door of bush villa behind us for the last time. i had days of privation there, and days of growing success during the eight long years that i had spent in portsmouth. now it was with a sense of wonderful freedom and exhilarating adventure that we set forth upon the next phase of our lives. chapter x the great break vienna--a specialist in wimpole street--the great decision--norwood--“the refugees”--reported death of holmes. we set forth upon a bitter winter day at the close of 1890 with every chance of being snowed up on our long trek. we got through all right, however, and found ourselves in vienna, arriving on a deadly cold night, with deep snow under foot and a cutting blizzard in the air. as we looked from the station the electric lights threw out the shining silver drift of snow flakes against the absolute darkness of the sky. it was a gloomy, ominous reception, but half an hour afterwards when we were in the warm cosy crowded tobacco-laden restaurant attached to our hotel we took a more cheerful view of our surroundings. we found a modest _pension_ which was within our means, and we put in a very pleasant four months, during which i attended eye lectures at the krankenhaus, but could certainly have learned far more in london, for even if one has a fair knowledge of conversational german it is very different from following accurately a rapid lecture filled with technical terms. no doubt “has studied in vienna” sounds well in a specialist’s record, but it is usually taken for granted that he has exhausted his own country before going abroad, which was by no means the case with me. therefore, so far as eye work goes, my winter was wasted, nor can i trace any particular spiritual or intellectual advance. on the other hand i saw a little of gay viennese society. i received kind and welcome hospitality from brinsley richards, “the times” correspondent, and his wife, and i had some excellent skating. i also wrote one short book, “the doings of raffles haw,” not a very notable achievement, by which i was able to pay my current expenses without encroaching on the very few hundred pounds which were absolutely all that i had in the world. this money was invested on the advice of a friend, and as it was almost all lost--like so much more that i have earned--it is just as well that i was never driven back upon it. with the spring my work at vienna had finished, if it can be said to have ever begun, and we returned via paris, putting in a few days there with landolt, who was the most famous french oculist of his time. it was great to find ourselves back in london once more with the feeling that we were now on the real field of battle, where we must conquer or perish, for our boats were burned behind us. it is easy now to look back and think that the issue was clear, but it was by no means so at the time, for i had earned little, though my reputation was growing. it was only my own inward conviction of the permanent merits of “the white company,” still appearing month by month in “cornhill,” which sustained my confidence. i had come through so much in the early days at southsea that nothing could alarm me personally, but i had a wife and child now, and the stern simplicity of life which was possible and even pleasant in early days was now no longer to be thought of. we took rooms in montague place, and i went forth to search for some place where i could put up my plate as an oculist. i was aware that many of the big men do not find time to work out refractions, which in some cases of astigmatism take a long time to adjust when done by retinoscopy. i was capable in this work and liked it, so i hoped that some of it might drift my way. but to get it, it was clearly necessary that i should live among the big men so that the patient could be easily referred to me. i searched the doctors’ quarters and at last found suitable accommodation at 2 devonshire place, which is at the top of wimpole street and close to the classical harley street. there for £120 a year i got the use of a front room with part use of a waiting room. i was soon to find that they were both waiting rooms, and now i know that it was better so. every morning i walked from the lodgings at montague place, reached my consulting room at ten and sat there until three or four, with never a ring to disturb my serenity. could better conditions for reflection and work be found? it was ideal, and so long as i was thoroughly unsuccessful in my professional venture there was every chance of improvement in my literary prospects. therefore when i returned to the lodgings at tea-time i bore my little sheaves with me, the first fruits of a considerable harvest. a number of monthly magazines were coming out at that time, notable among which was “the strand,” then as now under the editorship of greenhough smith. considering these various journals with their disconnected stories it had struck me that a single character running through a series, if it only engaged the attention of the reader, would bind that reader to that particular magazine. on the other hand, it had long seemed to me that the ordinary serial might be an impediment rather than a help to a magazine, since, sooner or later, one missed one number and afterwards it had lost all interest. clearly the ideal compromise was a character which carried through, and yet instalments which were each complete in themselves, so that the purchaser was always sure that he could relish the whole contents of the magazine. i believe that i was the first to realize this and “the strand magazine” the first to put it into practice. looking round for my central character i felt that sherlock holmes, whom i had already handled in two little books, would easily lend himself to a succession of short stories. these i began in the long hours of waiting in my consulting room. greenhough smith liked them from the first, and encouraged me to go ahead with them. my literary affairs had been taken up by that king of agents, a. p. watt, who relieved me of all the hateful bargaining, and handled things so well that any immediate anxiety for money soon disappeared. it was as well, for not one single patient had ever crossed the threshold of my room. i was now once more at a crossroads of my life, and providence, which i recognize at every step, made me realize it in a very energetic and unpleasant way. i was starting off for my usual trudge one morning from our lodgings when icy shivers passed over me, and i only got back in time to avoid a total collapse. it was a virulent attack of influenza, at a time when influenza was in its deadly prime. only three years before my dear sister annette, after spending her whole life on the family needs, had died of it at lisbon at the very moment when my success would have enabled me to recall her from her long servitude. now it was my turn, and i very nearly followed her. i can remember no pain or extreme discomfort, and no psychic experiences, but for a week i was in great danger, and then found myself as weak as a child and as emotional, but with a mind as clear as crystal. it was then, as i surveyed my own life, that i saw how foolish i was to waste my literary earnings in keeping up an oculist’s room in wimpole street, and i determined with a wild rush of joy to cut the painter and to trust for ever to my power of writing. i remember in my delight taking the handkerchief which lay upon the coverlet in my enfeebled hand, and tossing it up to the ceiling in my exultation. i should at last be my own master. no longer would i have to conform to professional dress or try to please any one else. i would be free to live how i liked and where i liked. it was one of the great moments of exultation of my life. the date was in august, 1891. presently i was about, hobbling on a stick and reflecting that if i lived to be eighty i knew already exactly how it would feel. i haunted house-agents, got lists of suburban villas, and spent some weeks, as my strength returned, in searching for a new home. finally i found a suitable house, modest but comfortable, isolated and yet one of a row. it was 12 tennison road, south norwood. there we settled down, and there i made my first effort to live entirely by my pen. it soon became evident that i had been playing the game well within my powers and that i should have no difficulty in providing a sufficient income. it seemed as if i had settled into a life which might be continuous, and i little foresaw that an unexpected blow was about to fall upon us, and that we were not at the end, but really at the beginning, of our wanderings. i could not know this, however, and i settled down with a stout heart to do some literary work worthy of the name. the difficulty of the holmes work was that every story really needed as clear-cut and original a plot as a longish book would do. one cannot without effort spin plots at such a rate. they are apt to become thin or to break. i was determined, now that i had no longer the excuse of absolute pecuniary pressure, never again to write anything which was not as good as i could possibly make it, and therefore i would not write a holmes story without a worthy plot and without a problem which interested my own mind, for that is the first requisite before you can interest any one else. if i have been able to sustain this character for a long time and if the public find, as they will find, that the last story is as good as the first, it is entirely due to the fact that i never, or hardly ever, forced a story. some have thought there was a falling off in the stories, and the criticism was neatly expressed by a cornish boatman who said to me, “i think, sir, when holmes fell over that cliff, he may not have killed himself, but all the same he was never quite the same man afterwards.” i think, however, that if the reader began the series backwards, so that he brought a fresh mind to the last stories, he would agree with me that, though the general average may not be conspicuously high, still the last one is as good as the first. i was weary, however, of inventing plots and i set myself now to do some work which would certainly be less remunerative but would be more ambitious from a literary point of view. i had long been attracted by the epoch of louis xiv and by those huguenots who were the french equivalents of our puritans. i had a good knowledge of the memoirs of that date, and many notes already prepared, so that it did not take me long to write “the refugees.” it has stood the acid test of time very well, so i may say that it was a success. soon after its appearance it was translated into french, and my mother, herself a great french scholar, had the joy when she visited fontainebleau to hear the official guide tell the drove of tourists that if they really wanted to know about the court of the great monarch, they would find the clearest and most accurate account in an englishman’s book, “the refugees.” i expect the guide would have been considerably astonished had he then and there been kissed by an elderly english lady, but it was an experience which he must have narrowly missed. i used in this book, also, a great deal which was drawn from parkman, that great but neglected historian, who was in my opinion the greatest serious writer that america has produced. there was an amusing episode connected with “the refugees,” when it was read aloud in some strict irish convent, the innocent reverend mother having mistaken my name and imagined that i was a canon, and therefore of course a holy man. i am told that the reading was a tremendous success and that the good sisters rejoiced that the mistake was not found out until the story was completed. my first name has several times led to mistakes, as when, at a big dinner at chicago, i was asked to say grace, as being the only ecclesiastic present. i remember that at the same dinner one of the speakers remarked that it was a most sinister fact that though i was a doctor no _living_ patient of mine had ever yet been seen. during this norwood interval, i was certainly working hard, for besides “the refugees” i wrote “the great shadow,” a booklet which i should put near the front of my work for merit, and two other little books on a very inferior plane--“the parasite” and “beyond the city.” the latter was of a domestic type unusual for me. it was pirated in new york just before the new copyright act came into force, and the rascal publisher thinking that a portrait--any sort of portrait--of the author would look well upon the cover, and being quite ignorant of my identity, put a very pretty and over-dressed young woman as my presentment. i still preserve a copy of this most flattering representation. all these books had some decent success, though none of it was remarkable. it was still the sherlock holmes stories for which the public clamoured, and these from time to time i endeavoured to supply. at last, after i had done two series of them i saw that i was in danger of having my hand forced, and of being entirely identified with what i regarded as a lower stratum of literary achievement. therefore as a sign of my resolution i determined to end the life of my hero. the idea was in my mind when i went with my wife for a short holiday in switzerland, in the course of which we saw there the wonderful falls of reichenbach, a terrible place, and one that i thought would make a worthy tomb for poor sherlock, even if i buried my banking account along with him. so there i laid him, fully determined that he should stay there--as indeed for some years he did. i was amazed at the concern expressed by the public. they say that a man is never properly appreciated until he is dead, and the general protest against my summary execution of holmes taught me how many and how numerous were his friends. “you brute” was the beginning of the letter of remonstrance which one lady sent me, and i expect she spoke for others besides herself. i heard of many who wept. i fear i was utterly callous myself, and only glad to have a chance of opening out into new fields of imagination, for the temptation of high prices made it difficult to get one’s thoughts away from holmes. that sherlock holmes was anything but mythical to many is shown by the fact that i have had many letters addressed to him with requests that i forward them. watson has also had a number of letters in which he has been asked for the address or for the autograph of his more brilliant confrère. a press-cutting agency wrote to watson asking whether holmes would not wish to subscribe. when holmes retired several elderly ladies were ready to keep house for him and one sought to ingratiate herself by assuring me that she knew all about bee-keeping and could “segregate the queen.” i had considerable offers also for holmes if he would examine and solve various family mysteries. once the offer--from poland--was that i should myself go, and my reward was practically left to my own judgment. i had judgment enough, however, to avoid it altogether. i have often been asked whether i had myself the qualities which i depicted, or whether i was merely the watson that i look. of course i am well aware that it is one thing to grapple with a practical problem and quite another thing when you are allowed to solve it under your own conditions. i have no delusions about that. at the same time a man cannot spin a character out of his own inner consciousness and make it really life-like unless he has some possibilities of that character within him--which is a dangerous admission for one who has drawn so many villains as i. in my poem “the inner room,” describing our multiplex personality, i say: “there are others who are sitting, grim as doom, in the dim ill-boding shadow of my room. darkling figures, stern or quaint, now a savage, now a saint, showing fitfully and faint in the gloom.” among those figures there may perhaps be an astute detective also, but i find that in real life in order to find him i have to inhibit all the others and get into a mood when there is no one in the room but he. then i get results and have several times solved problems by holmes’ methods after the police have been baffled. yet i must admit that in ordinary life i am by no means observant and that i have to throw myself into an artificial frame of mind before i can weigh evidence and anticipate the sequence of events. chapter xi sidelights on sherlock holmes “the speckled band”--barrie’s parody on holmes--holmes on the films--methods of construction--problems--curious letters--some personal cases--strange happenings. i may as well interrupt my narrative here in order to say what may interest my readers about my most notorious character. the impression that holmes was a real person of flesh and blood may have been intensified by his frequent appearance upon the stage. after the withdrawal of my dramatization of “rodney stone” from a theatre upon which i held a six months’ lease, i determined to play a bold and energetic game, for an empty theatre spells ruin. when i saw the course that things were taking i shut myself up and devoted my whole mind to making a sensational sherlock holmes drama. i wrote it in a week and called it “the speckled band” after the short story of that name. i do not think that i exaggerate if i say that within a fortnight of the one play shutting down i had a company working upon the rehearsals of a second one, which had been written in the interval. it was a considerable success. lyn harding, as the half epileptic and wholly formidable doctor grimesby rylott, was most masterful, while saintsbury as sherlock holmes was also very good. before the end of the run i had cleared off all that i had lost upon the other play, and i had created a permanent property of some value. it became a stock piece and is even now touring the country. we had a fine rock boa to play the title-rôle, a snake which was the pride of my heart, so one can imagine my disgust when i saw that one critic ended his disparaging review by the words “the crisis of the play was produced by the appearance of a palpably artificial serpent.” i was inclined to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake to go to bed with it. we had several snakes at different times, but they were none of them born actors and they were all inclined either to hang down from the hole in the wall like inanimate bell-pulls, or else to turn back through the hole and get even with the stage carpenter who pinched their tails in order to make them more lively. finally we used artificial snakes, and every one, including the stage carpenter, agreed that it was more satisfactory. this was the second sherlock holmes play. i should have spoken about the first, which was produced very much earlier, in fact at the time of the african war. it was written and most wonderfully acted by william gillette, the famous american. since he used my characters and to some extent my plots, he naturally gave me a share in the undertaking, which proved to be very successful. “may i marry holmes?” was one cable which i received from him when in the throes of composition. “you may marry or murder or do what you like with him,” was my heartless reply. i was charmed both with the play, the acting and the pecuniary result. i think that every man with a drop of artistic blood in his veins would agree that the latter consideration, though very welcome when it does arrive, is still the last of which he thinks. sir james barrie paid his respects to sherlock holmes in a rollicking parody. it was really a gay gesture of resignation over the failure which we had encountered with a comic opera for which he undertook to write the libretto. i collaborated with him on this, but in spite of our joint efforts, the piece fell flat. whereupon barrie sent me a parody on holmes, written on the fly leaves of one of his books. it ran thus:-- the adventure of the two collaborators in bringing to a close the adventures of my friend sherlock holmes i am perforce reminded that he never, save on the occasion which, as you will now hear, brought his singular career to an end, consented to act in any mystery which was concerned with persons who made a livelihood by their pen. “i am not particular about the people i mix among for business purposes,” he would say, “but at literary characters i draw the line.” we were in our rooms in baker street one evening. i was (i remember) by the centre table writing out “the adventure of the man without a cork leg” (which had so puzzled the royal society and all the other scientific bodies of europe), and holmes was amusing himself with a little revolver practice. it was his custom of a summer evening to fire round my head, just shaving my face, until he had made a photograph of me on the opposite wall, and it is a slight proof of his skill that many of these portraits in pistol shots are considered admirable likenesses. i happened to look out of the window, and perceiving two gentlemen advancing rapidly along baker street asked him who they were. he immediately lit his pipe, and, twisting himself on a chair into the figure 8, replied: “they are two collaborators in comic opera, and their play has not been a triumph.” i sprang from my chair to the ceiling in amazement, and he then explained: “my dear watson, they are obviously men who follow some low calling. that much even you should be able to read in their faces. those little pieces of blue paper which they fling angrily from them are durrant’s press notices. of these they have obviously hundreds about their person (see how their pockets bulge). they would not dance on them if they were pleasant reading.” i again sprang to the ceiling (which is much dented), and shouted: “amazing! but they may be mere authors.” “no,” said holmes, “for mere authors only get one press notice a week. only criminals, dramatists and actors get them by the hundred.” “then they may be actors.” “no, actors would come in a carriage.” “can you tell me anything else about them?” “a great deal. from the mud on the boots of the tall one i perceive that he comes from south norwood. the other is as obviously a scotch author.” “how can you tell that?” “he is carrying in his pocket a book called (i clearly see) ‘auld licht something.’ would any one but the author be likely to carry about a book with such a title?” i had to confess that this was improbable. it was now evident that the two men (if such they can be called) were seeking our lodgings. i have said (often) that my friend holmes seldom gave way to emotion of any kind, but he now turned livid with passion. presently this gave place to a strange look of triumph. “watson,” he said, “that big fellow has for years taken the credit for my most remarkable doings, but at last i have him--at last!” up i went to the ceiling, and when i returned the strangers were in the room. “i perceive, gentlemen,” said mr. sherlock holmes, “that you are at present afflicted by an extraordinary novelty.” the handsomer of our visitors asked in amazement how he knew this, but the big one only scowled. “you forget that you wear a ring on your fourth finger,” replied mr. holmes calmly. i was about to jump to the ceiling when the big brute interposed. “that tommy-rot is all very well for the public, holmes,” said he, “but you can drop it before me. and, watson, if you go up to the ceiling again i shall make you stay there.” here i observed a curious phenomenon. my friend sherlock holmes _shrank_. he became small before my eyes. i looked longingly at the ceiling, but dared not. “let us cut the first four pages,” said the big man, “and proceed to business. i want to know why----” “allow me,” said mr. holmes, with some of his old courage. “you want to know why the public does not go to your opera.” “exactly,” said the other ironically, “as you perceive by my shirt stud.” he added more gravely, “and as you can only find out in one way i must insist on your witnessing an entire performance of the piece.” it was an anxious moment for me. i shuddered, for i knew that if holmes went i should have to go with him. but my friend had a heart of gold. “never,” he cried fiercely, “i will do anything for you save that.” “your continued existence depends on it,” said the big man menacingly. “i would rather melt into air,” replied holmes, proudly taking another chair. “but i can tell you why the public don’t go to your piece without sitting the thing out myself.” “why?” “because,” replied holmes calmly, “they prefer to stay away.” a dead silence followed that extraordinary remark. for a moment the two intruders gazed with awe upon the man who had unravelled their mystery so wonderfully. then drawing their knives---- holmes grew less and less, until nothing was left save a ring of smoke which slowly circled to the ceiling. the last words of great men are often noteworthy. these were the last words of sherlock holmes: “fool, fool! i have kept you in luxury for years. by my help you have ridden extensively in cabs, where no author was ever seen before. _henceforth you will ride in buses!_” the brute sunk into a chair aghast. the other author did not turn a hair. _to a. conan doyle, from his friend j. m. barrie._ this parody, the best of all the numerous parodies, may be taken as an example not only of the author’s wit but of his debonnaire courage, for it was written immediately after our joint failure which at the moment was a bitter thought for both of us. there is indeed nothing more miserable than a theatrical failure, for you feel how many others who have backed you have been affected by it. it was, i am glad to say, my only experience of it, and i have no doubt that barrie could say the same. before i leave the subject of the many impersonations of holmes i may say that all of them, and all the drawings, are very unlike my own original idea of the man. i saw him as very tall--“over 6 feet, but so excessively lean that he seemed considerably taller,” said “a study in scarlet.” he had, as i imagined him, a thin razor-like face, with a great hawks-bill of a nose, and two small eyes, set close together on either side of it. such was my conception. it chanced, however, that poor sidney paget who, before his premature death, drew all the original pictures, had a younger brother whose name, i think, was walter, who served him as a model. the handsome walter took the place of the more powerful but uglier sherlock, and perhaps from the point of view of my lady readers it was as well. the stage has followed the type set up by the pictures. films of course were unknown when the stories appeared, and when these rights were finally discussed and a small sum offered for them by a french company it seemed treasure trove and i was very glad to accept. afterwards i had to buy them back again at exactly ten times what i had received, so the deal was a disastrous one. but now they have been done by the stoll company with eille norwood as holmes, and it was worth all the expense to get so fine a production. norwood has since played the part on the stage and won the approbation of the london public. he has that rare quality which can only be described as glamour, which compels you to watch an actor eagerly even when he is doing nothing. he has the brooding eye which excites expectation and he has also a quite unrivalled power of disguise. my only criticism of the films is that they introduce telephones, motor cars and other luxuries of which the victorian holmes never dreamed. people have often asked me whether i knew the end of a holmes story before i started it. of course i do. one could not possibly steer a course if one did not know one’s destination. the first thing is to get your idea. having got that key idea one’s next task is to conceal it and lay emphasis upon everything which can make for a different explanation. holmes, however, can see all the fallacies of the alternatives, and arrives more or less dramatically at the true solution by steps which he can describe and justify. he shows his powers by what the south americans now call “sherlockholmitos,” which means clever little deductions which often have nothing to do with the matter in hand, but impress the reader with a general sense of power. the same effect is gained by his offhand allusion to other cases. heaven knows how many titles i have thrown about in a casual way, and how many readers have begged me to satisfy their curiosity as to “rigoletto and his abominable wife,” “the adventure of the tired captain,” or “the curious experience of the patterson family in the island of uffa.” once or twice, as in “the adventure of the second stain,” which in my judgment is one of the neatest of the stories, i did actually use the title years before i wrote a story to correspond. there are some questions concerned with particular stories which turn up periodically from every quarter of the globe. in “the adventure of the priory school” holmes remarks in his offhand way that by looking at a bicycle track on a damp moor one can say which way it was heading. i had so many remonstrances upon this point, varying from pity to anger, that i took out my bicycle and tried. i had imagined that the observations of the way in which the track of the hind wheel overlaid the track of the front one when the machine was not running dead straight would show the direction. i found that my correspondents were right and i was wrong, for this would be the same whichever way the cycle was moving. on the other hand the real solution was much simpler, for on an undulating moor the wheels make a much deeper impression uphill and a more shallow one downhill, so holmes was justified of his wisdom after all. sometimes i have got upon dangerous ground where i have taken risks through my own want of knowledge of the correct atmosphere. i have, for example, never been a racing man, and yet i ventured to write “silver blaze,” in which the mystery depends upon the laws of training and racing. the story is all right, and holmes may have been at the top of his form, but my ignorance cries aloud to heaven. i read an excellent and very damaging criticism of the story in some sporting paper, written clearly by a man who _did_ know, in which he explained the exact penalties which would have come upon every one concerned if they had acted as i described. half would have been in jail and the other half warned off the turf for ever. however, i have never been nervous about details, and one must be masterful sometimes. when an alarmed editor wrote to me once: “there is no second line of rails at that point,” i answered, “i make one.” on the other hand, there are cases where accuracy is essential. i do not wish to be ungrateful to holmes, who has been a good friend to me in many ways. if i have sometimes been inclined to weary of him it is because his character admits of no light or shade. he is a calculating machine, and anything you add to that simply weakens the effect. thus the variety of the stories must depend upon the romance and compact handling of the plots. i would say a word for watson also, who in the course of seven volumes never shows one gleam of humour or makes one single joke. to make a real character one must sacrifice everything to consistency and remember goldsmith’s criticism of johnson that “he would make the little fishes talk like whales.” i do not think that i ever realized what a living actual personality holmes had become to the more guileless readers, until i heard of the very pleasing story of the char-à-bancs of french schoolboys who, when asked what they wanted to see first in london, replied unanimously that they wanted to see mr. holmes’ lodgings in baker street. many have asked me which house it is, but that is a point which for excellent reasons i will not decide. there are certain sherlock holmes stories, apocryphal i need not say, which go round and round the press and turn up at fixed intervals with the regularity of a comet. one is the story of the cabman who is supposed to have taken me to an hotel in paris. “dr. doyle,” he cried, gazing at me fixedly, “i perceive from your appearance that you have been recently at constantinople. i have reason to think also that you have been at buda, and i perceive some indication that you were not far from milan.” “wonderful. five francs for the secret of how you did it?” “i looked at the labels pasted on your trunk,” said the astute cabby. another perennial is of the woman who is said to have consulted sherlock. “i am greatly puzzled, sir. in one week i have lost a motor horn, a brush, a box of golf balls, a dictionary and a bootjack. can you explain it?” “nothing simpler, madame,” said sherlock. “it is clear that your neighbour keeps a goat.” there was a third about how sherlock entered heaven, and by virtue of his power of observation at once greeted adam but the point is perhaps too anatomical for further discussion. i suppose that every author receives a good many curious letters. certainly i have done so. quite a number of these have been from russia. when they have been in the vernacular i have been compelled to take them as read, but when they have been in english they have been among the most curious in my collection. there was one young lady who began all her epistles with the words “good lord.” another had a large amount of guile underlying her simplicity. writing from warsaw, she stated that she had been bedridden for two years, and that my novels had been her only, etc., etc. so touched was i by this flattering statement that i at once prepared an autographed parcel of them to complete the fair invalid’s collection. by good luck, however, i met a brother author on the same day to whom i recounted the touching incident. with a cynical smile, he drew an identical letter from his pocket. his novels had also been for two years her only, etc., etc. i do not know how many more the lady had written to; but if, as i imagine, her correspondence had extended to several countries, she must have amassed a rather interesting library. the young russian’s habit of addressing me as “good lord” had an even stranger parallel at home which links it up with the subject of this article. shortly after i received a knighthood, i had a bill from a tradesman which was quite correct and businesslike in every detail save that it was made out to sir sherlock holmes. i hope that i can stand a joke as well as my neighbours, but this particular piece of humour seemed rather misapplied and i wrote sharply upon the subject. in response to my letter there arrived at my hotel a very repentant clerk, who expressed his sorrow at the incident, but kept on repeating the phrase, “i assure you, sir, that it was bonâ fide.” “what do you mean by bonâ fide?” i asked. “well, sir,” he replied, “my mates in the shop told me that you had been knighted, and that when a man was knighted he changed his name, and that you had taken that one.” i need not say that my annoyance vanished, and that i laughed as heartily as his pals were probably doing round the corner. a few of the problems which have come my way have been very similar to some which i had invented for the exhibition of the reasoning of mr. holmes. i might perhaps quote one in which that gentleman’s method of thought was copied with complete success. the case was as follows: a gentleman had disappeared. he had drawn a bank balance of £40 which was known to be on him. it was feared that he had been murdered for the sake of the money. he had last been heard of stopping at a large hotel in london, having come from the country that day. in the evening he went to a music-hall performance, came out of it about ten o’clock, returned to his hotel, changed his evening clothes, which were found in his room next day, and disappeared utterly. no one saw him leave the hotel, but a man occupying a neighbouring room declared that he had heard him moving during the night. a week had elapsed at the time that i was consulted, but the police had discovered nothing. where was the man? these were the whole of the facts as communicated to me by his relatives in the country. endeavouring to see the matter through the eyes of mr. holmes, i answered by return mail that he was evidently either in glasgow or in edinburgh. it proved later that he had, as a fact, gone to edinburgh, though in the week that had passed he had moved to another part of scotland. there i should leave the matter, for, as dr. watson has often shown, a solution explained is a mystery spoiled. at this stage the reader can lay down the book and show how simple it all is by working out the problem for himself. he has all the data which were ever given to me. for the sake of those, however, who have no turn for such conundrums, i will try to indicate the links which make the chain. the one advantage which i possessed was that i was familiar with the routine of london hotels--though i fancy it differs little from that of hotels elsewhere. the first thing was to look at the facts and separate what was certain from what was conjecture. it was _all_ certain except the statement of the person who heard the missing man in the night. how could he tell such a sound from any other sound in a large hotel? that point could be disregarded, if it traversed the general conclusions. the first clear deduction was that the man had meant to disappear. why else should he draw all his money? he had got out of the hotel during the night. but there is a night porter in all hotels, and it is impossible to get out without his knowledge when the door is once shut. the door is shut after the theatre-goers return--say at twelve o’clock. therefore, the man left the hotel before twelve o’clock. he had come from the music-hall at ten, had changed his clothes, and had departed with his bag. no one had seen him do so. the inference is that he had done it at the moment when the hall was full of the returning guests, which is from eleven to eleven-thirty. after that hour, even if the door were still open, there are few people coming and going so that he with his bag would certainly have been seen. having got so far upon firm ground, we now ask ourselves why a man who desires to hide himself should go out at such an hour. if he intended to conceal himself in london he need never have gone to the hotel at all. clearly then he was going to catch a train which would carry him away. but a man who is deposited by a train in any provincial station during the night is likely to be noticed, and he might be sure that when the alarm was raised and his description given, some guard or porter would remember him. therefore, his destination would be some large town which he would reach as a terminus where all his fellow passengers would disembark and where he would lose himself in the crowd. when one turns up the time-table and sees that the great scotch expresses bound for edinburgh and glasgow start about midnight, the goal is reached. as for his dress-suit, the fact that he abandoned it proved that he intended to adopt a line of life where there were no social amenities. this deduction also proved to be correct. i quote such a case in order to show that the general lines of reasoning advocated by holmes have a real practical application to life. in another case, where a girl had become engaged to a young foreigner who suddenly disappeared, i was able, by a similar process of deduction, to show her very clearly both whither he had gone and how unworthy he was of her affections. on the other hand, these semi-scientific methods are occasionally laboured and slow as compared with the results of the rough-and-ready, practical man. lest i should seem to have been throwing bouquets either to myself or to mr. holmes, let me state that on the occasion of a burglary of the village inn, within a stone-throw of my house, the village constable, with no theories at all, had seized the culprit while i had got no further than that he was a left-handed man with nails in his boots. the unusual or dramatic effects which lead to the invocation of mr. holmes in fiction are, of course, great aids to him in reaching a conclusion. it is the case where there is nothing to get hold of which is the deadly one. i heard of such a one in america which would certainly have presented a formidable problem. a gentleman of blameless life starting off for a sunday evening walk with his family, suddenly observed that he had forgotten something. he went back into the house, the door of which was still open, and he left his people waiting for him outside. he never reappeared, and from that day to this there has been no clue as to what befell him. this was certainly one of the strangest cases of which i have ever heard in real life. another very singular case came within my own observation. it was sent to me by an eminent london publisher. this gentleman had in his employment a head of department whose name we shall take as musgrave. he was a hardworking person, with no special feature in his character. mr. musgrave died, and several years after his death a letter was received addressed to him, in the care of his employers. it bore the postmark of a tourist resort in the west of canada, and had the note “conflfilms” upon the outside of the envelope, with the words “report sy” in one corner. the publishers naturally opened the envelope as they had no note of the dead man’s relatives. inside were two blank sheets of paper. the letter, i may add, was registered. the publisher, being unable to make anything of this, sent it on to me, and i submitted the blank sheets to every possible chemical and heat test, with no result whatever. beyond the fact that the writing appeared to be that of a woman there is nothing to add to this account. the matter was, and remains, an insoluble mystery. how the correspondent could have something so secret to say to mr. musgrave and yet not be aware that this person had been dead for several years is very hard to understand--or why blank sheets should be so carefully registered through the mail. i may add that i did not trust the sheets to my own chemical tests, but had the best expert advice without getting any result. considered as a case it was a failure--and a very tantalizing one. mr. sherlock holmes has always been a fair mark for practical jokers, and i have had numerous bogus cases of various degrees of ingenuity, marked cards, mysterious warnings, cypher messages, and other curious communications. it is astonishing the amount of trouble which some people will take with no object save a mystification. upon one occasion, as i was entering the hall to take part in an amateur billiard competition, i was handed by the attendant a small packet which had been left for me. upon opening it i found a piece of ordinary green chalk such as is used in billiards. i was amused by the incident, and i put the chalk into my waistcoat pocket and used it during the game. afterward, i continued to use it until one day, some months later, as i rubbed the tip of my cue the face of the chalk crumbled in, and i found it was hollow. from the recess thus exposed i drew out a small slip of paper with the words “from arsene lupin to sherlock holmes.” imagine the state of mind of the joker who took such trouble to accomplish such a result. one of the mysteries submitted to mr. holmes was rather upon the psychic plane and therefore beyond his powers. the facts as alleged are most remarkable, though i have no proof of their truth save that the lady wrote earnestly and gave both her name and address. the person, whom we will call mrs. seagrave, had been given a curious secondhand ring, snake-shaped, and dull gold. this she took from her finger at night. one night she slept with it on and had a fearsome dream in which she seemed to be pushing off some furious creature which fastened its teeth into her arm. on awakening, the pain in the arm continued, and next day the imprint of a double set of teeth appeared upon the arm, with one tooth of the lower jaw missing. the marks were in the shape of blue-black bruises which had not broken the skin. [illustration] “i do not know,” says my correspondent, “what made me think the ring had anything to do with the matter, but i took a dislike to the thing and did not wear it for some months, when, being on a visit, i took to wearing it again.” to make a long story short, the same thing happened, and the lady settled the matter for ever by dropping her ring into the hottest corner of the kitchen range. this curious story, which i believe to be genuine, may not be as supernatural as it seems. it is well known that in some subjects a strong mental impression does produce a physical effect. thus a very vivid nightmare dream with the impression of a bite might conceivably produce the mark of a bite. such cases are well attested in medical annals. the second incident would, of course, arise by unconscious suggestion from the first. none the less, it is a very interesting little problem, whether psychic or material. buried treasures are naturally among the problems which have come to mr. holmes. one genuine case was accompanied by a diagram here reproduced. it refers to an indiaman which was wrecked upon the south african coast in the year 1782. if i were a younger man, i should be seriously inclined to go personally and look into the matter. the ship contained a remarkable treasure, including, i believe, the old crown regalia of delhi. it is surmised that they buried these near the coast, and that this chart is a note of the spot. each indiaman in those days had its own semaphore code, and it is conjectured that the three marks upon the left are signals from a three-armed semaphore. some record of their meaning might perhaps even now be found in the old papers of the india office. the circle upon the right gives the compass bearings. the larger semi-circle may be the curved edge of a reef or of a rock. the figures above are the indications how to reach the x which marks the treasure. possibly they may give the bearings as 186 feet from the 4 upon the semi-circle. the scene of the wreck is a lonely part of the country, but i shall be surprised if sooner or later, some one does not seriously set to work to solve the mystery--indeed at the present moment there is a small company working to that end. i must now apologise for this digressive chapter and return to the orderly sequence of my career. chapter xii norwood and switzerland psychic research society--psychic leanings--literary circles in london--young writers--henry irving--a great blow--davos--“brigadier gerard”--major pond--american lecturing in 1894--first lecture--anti-british wave--answer to prayer. the chief event of our norwood life was the birth of my son kingsley, who lived to play a man’s part in the great war, and who died shortly after its conclusion. my own life was so busy that i had little time for religious development, but my thoughts still ran much upon psychic matters, and it was at this time that i joined the psychical research society, of which i am now one of the senior members. i had few psychic experiences myself, and my material philosophy, as expressed in the “stark munro letters,” which were written just at the end of the norwood period, was so strong that it did not easily crumble. yet as year by year i read the wonderful literature of psychic science and experience, i became more and more impressed by the strength of the spiritualist position and by the levity and want of all dignity and accurate knowledge which characterized the attitude of their opponents. the religious side of the matter had not yet struck me, but i felt more and more that the case for the phenomena vouched for by such men as sir william crookes, barrett, russel wallace, victor hugo and zöllner was so strong that i could see no answer to their exact record of observations. “it is incredible but it is true,” said crookes, and the aphorism seemed to exactly express my dawning convictions. i had a weekly impulse from the psychic paper, “light,” which has, i maintain, during its long career and up to the present day, presented as much brain to the square inch as any journal published in great britain. my pleasant recollection of those days from 1880 to 1893 lay in my first introduction, as a more or less rising author, to the literary life of london. it is extraordinary to remember that at that time there was a general jeremiad in the london press about the extinction of english literature, and the assumed fact that there were no rising authors to take the place of those who were gone. the real fact is that there was a most amazing crop, all coming up simultaneously, presenting perhaps no dickens or thackeray, but none the less so numerous and many sided and with so high an average of achievement that i think they would match for varied excellence any similar harvest in our literary history. it was during the years roughly from 1888 to 1893 that rudyard kipling, james stephen phillips, watson, grant allen, wells, barrie, bernard shaw, h. a. jones, pinero, marie corelli, stanley weyman, anthony hope, hall caine, and a whole list of others were winning their spurs. many of these i met in the full flush of their youth and their powers. of some of them i will speak more fully later. as to the old school they were certainly somewhat of a declension, and the newcomers found no very serious opposition in gaining a hearing. wilkie collins, trollope, george eliot and charles reade had passed. i have always been a very great admirer of the last, who was really a great innovator as well as a most dramatic writer, for it was he who first introduced realism and founded his stories upon carefully arranged documents. he was the literary father of zola. george eliot has never appealed to me much, for i like my effects in a less leisurely fashion; but trollope also i consider to be a very original writer, though i fancy he traces his ancestry through jane austen. no writer is ever absolutely original. he always joins at some point onto that old tree of which he is a branch. of the literary men whom i met at that time my most vivid recollections are of the group who centred round the new magazine, “the idler,” which had been started by jerome k. jerome, who had deservedly shot into fame with his splendidly humorous “three men in a boat.” it has all the exuberance and joy of life which youth brings with it, and even now if i have ever time to be at all sad, which is seldom enough, i can laugh away the shadows when i open that book. jerome is a man who, like most humorists, has a very serious side to his character, as all who have seen “the third floor back” will acknowledge, but he was inclined to be hotheaded and intolerant in political matters, from pure earnestness of purpose, which alienated some of his friends. he was associated in the editorship of “the idler” with robert barr, a volcanic anglo- or rather scot-american, with a violent manner, a wealth of strong adjectives, and one of the kindest of natures underneath it all. he was one of the best raconteurs i have ever known, and as a writer i have always felt that he did not quite come into his own. george burgin, like some quaint gentle character from dickens, was the sub-editor, and barrie, zangwill, and many other rising men were among the contributors who met periodically at dinner. i was not unfaithful to “the strand,” but there were some contributions which they did not need, and with these i established my connection with “the idler.” it was at this time and in this way that i met james barrie, of whom i shall have more to say when i come to that chapter which treats of some eminent and interesting men whom i have known. two isolated facts stand out in my memory during that time at norwood. one was that there seemed to be an imminent danger of war with france and that i applied for the mediterranean war-correspondentship of the “central news,” guessing that the chief centre of activity and interest would be in that quarter. i got the appointment and was all ready to start, but fortunately the crisis passed. the second was my first venture in the drama. i had written a short story called “a straggler of ’15,” which had seemed to me to be a moving picture of an old soldier and his ways. my own eyes were moist as i wrote it and that is the surest way to moisten those of others. i now turned this into a one-act play, and, greatly daring, i sent it to henry irving, of whose genius i had been a fervent admirer ever since those edinburgh days when i had paid my sixpence for the gallery night after night to see him in “hamlet” and “the lyons mail.” to my great delight i had a pleasing note from bram stoker, the great man’s secretary, offering me £100 for the copyright. it was a good bargain for him, for it is not too much to say that corporal gregory brewster became one of his stock parts and it had the enormous advantage that the older he got the more naturally he played it. the house laughed and sobbed, exactly as i had done when i wrote it. several critics went out of their way to explain that the merit lay entirely with the great actor and had nothing to do with the indifferent play, but as a matter of fact the last time i saw it acted it was by a real corporal from a military camp in the humble setting of a village hall and it had exactly the same effect upon the audience which irving produced at the lyceum. so perhaps there was something in writing after all, and certainly every stage effect was indicated in the manuscript. i would add that with his characteristic largeness in money matters irving always sent me a guinea for each performance in spite of his purchase of the copyright. henry irving the son carried on the part and played it, in my opinion, better than the father. i can well remember the flush of pleasure on his face when i uttered the word “better” and how he seized my hand. i have no doubt it was trying for his great powers to be continually belittled by their measurement with those of his giant father, to whom he bore so remarkable a physical resemblance. his premature death was a great loss to the stage, as was that of his brother lawrence, drowned with his wife in the great canadian river of the same name as himself. i now come to the great misfortune which darkened and deflected our lives. i have said that my wife and i had taken a tour in switzerland. i do not know whether she had over-taxed herself in this excursion, or whether we encountered microbes in some inn bedroom, but the fact remains that within a few weeks of our return she complained of pain in her side and cough. i had no suspicion of anything serious, but sent for the nearest good physician. to my surprise and alarm he told me when he descended from the bedroom that the lungs were very gravely affected, that there was every sign of rapid consumption and that he thought the case a most serious one with little hope, considering her record and family history, of a permanent cure. with two children, aged four and one, and a wife who was in such deadly danger, the situation was a difficult one. i confirmed the diagnosis by having sir douglas powell down to see her, and i then set all my energy to work to save the situation. the home was abandoned, the newly bought furniture was sold, and we made for davos in the high alps where there seemed the best chance of killing this accursed microbe which was rapidly eating out her vitals. and we succeeded. when i think that the attack was one of what is called “galloping consumption,” and that the doctors did not give more than a few months, and yet that we postponed the fatal issue from 1893 to 1906, i think it is proof that the successive measures were wise. the invalid’s life was happy too, for it was necessarily spent in glorious scenery. it was seldom marred by pain, and it was sustained by that optimism which is peculiar to the disease, and which came naturally to her quietly contented nature. as there were no particular social distractions at davos, and as our life was bounded by the snow and fir which girt us in, i was able to devote myself to doing a good deal of work and also to taking up with some energy the winter sports for which the place is famous. whilst there i began the brigadier gerard series of stories, founded largely upon that great book, “the memoirs of general marbot.” this entailed a great deal of research into napoleonic days, and my military detail was, i think, very accurate--so much so that i had a warm letter of appreciation from archibald forbes, the famous war correspondent, who was himself a great napoleonic and military student. before the end of the winter we were assured that the ravages of the disease had been checked. i dared not return to england, however, for fear of a relapse, so with the summer we moved on to maloja, another health resort at the end of the engadine valley, and there we endeavoured to hold all we had won--which, with occasional relapses, we succeeded in doing. my sister lottie, free at last from the work which she had so bravely done, had now joined us. connie, the younger sister, had come back from portugal earlier, and had joined us at norwood, where she had met and eventually married e. w. hornung the novelist. of hornung i will speak later. in the meantime lottie’s presence and the improvement of the invalid, which was so marked that no sudden crisis was thought at all possible, gave me renewed liberty of action. before the catastrophe occurred i had given some lectures on literature at home, and the work with its movement and bustle was not distasteful to me. now i was strongly pressed to go to america on the same errand, and in the late autumn of 1894 i set out on this new adventure. my brother innes, he who had shared my first days in southsea, had since passed through richmond public school, and afterwards the woolwich academy, so that he was now just emerging as a subaltern. as i needed some companion, and as i thought that the change would do him good, i asked him to come with me to the states. we crossed on the ill-fated german liner _elbe_, which a very short time afterwards was sunk in collision with a collier in the north sea. already i observed evidence of that irrational hatred of the british which in the course of twenty years was to lead to so terrific a result involving the destruction of the german empire. i remember that on some fête day on board, the saloon was thickly decorated with german and american flags without one single british one, though a fair proportion of the passengers were british. innes and i then and there drew a union jack and stuck it up aloft, where its isolation drew attention to our grievance. major pond was my impresario in america, and a quaint character he was. he seemed the very personification of his country, huge, loose limbed, straggling, with a goat’s beard and a nasal voice. he had fought in the civil war and been mixed up with every historical american event of his lifetime. he was a good, kind fellow and we formed a friendship which was never broken. he met us in the docks, and carried us off to a little hotel beside the aldine club, a small literary club, in which we had our meals. i have treated america and my impression of that amazing and perplexing country in later pages of these memoirs, when i visited it under more detached conditions. at present it was all hard work with little time for general observations. pond had fixed me up a pretty hard schedule, but on the other hand i had bargained to get back to davos in time to spend christmas with my wife, so that there was a limit to my servitude. my first reading was given in a fashionable baptist church, which was the usual launching slip for pond’s new lecturers. we had walked from the retiring room and were just coming in sight of the audience when i felt something tickle my ear. i put up my hand and found that my collar was undone, my tie had fallen off, and my stud, the first cause of all the trouble, had disappeared. standing there, on the edge of the platform, pond dragged out his own stud. i replaced everything, and sailed on quite as i should be, while pond retired to refit. it is strange, and possibly more than coincidence, how often one is prevented at the last moment from making some foolish appearance in public. the readings went very well and the audience was generous in applause. i have my own theory of reading, which is that it should be entirely disassociated from acting and should be made as natural and also as audible as possible. such a presentment is, i am sure, the less tiring for an audience. indeed i read to them exactly as in my boyhood i used to read to my mother. i gave extracts from recent british authors, including some work of my own, and as i mixed up the grave and the gay i was able to keep them mildly entertained for an hour. some papers maintained that i could not read at all, but i think that what they really meant was that i did not act at all. others seemed to endorse my method. anyhow i had an excellent first reception and pond told me that he lay smiling all night after it. he had no difficulty afterwards in booking as many engagements as he could fit into the time. i visited every town of any size between boston in the north and washington in the south, while chicago and milwaukee marked my western limit. sometimes i found that it took me all my time to fit in the engagements, however fast i might travel. once, for example, i lectured at daly’s theatre in new york at a matinée, at princeton college the same evening, some 50 miles away, and at philadelphia next afternoon. it was no wonder that i got very tired--the more so as the exuberant hospitality in those pre-prohibition days was enough in itself to take the energies out of the visitor. it was all done in kindness, but it was dangerous for a man who had his work to do. i had one little break when i paid a pleasant visit to rudyard kipling, of which i shall speak later. bar those few days i was going hard all the time, and it is no wonder that i was so tired out that i kept to my bunk most of the way from new york to liverpool. my memories are the confused ones of a weary man. i recall one amusing incident when as i bustled on to the stage at daly’s theatre i tripped over the wooden sill of the stage door, with the result that i came cantering down the sloping stage towards the audience, shedding books and papers on my way. there was much laughter and a general desire for an encore. our visit was marred by one of those waves of anti-british feeling which sweep occasionally over the states, and which emanate from their own early history, every grievance being exaggerated and inflamed by the constant hostility of irish pressmen and politicians. it all seems very absurd and contemptible to the travelling briton, because he is aware how entirely one-sided it is, and how welcome, for example, is the american flag in every british public display. this was not known by the home-staying american, and probably he imagined that his own country was treated as rudely by us as ours by his. the dunraven yacht race had given additional acerbity to this chronic ill-feeling, and it was very active at the time of our visit. i remember that a banquet was given to us at a club at detroit at which the wine flowed freely, and which ended by a speech by one of our hosts in which he bitterly attacked the british empire. my brother and i, with one or two canadians who were present, were naturally much affronted, but we made every allowance for the lateness of the evening. i asked leave, however, to reply to the speech, and some of those who were present have assured me that they have never forgotten what i said. in the course of my remarks i said: “you americans have lived up to now within your own palings, and know nothing of the real world outside. but now your land is filled up, and you will be compelled to mix more with the other nations. when you do so you will find that there is only one which can at all understand your ways and your aspirations, or will have the least sympathy. that is the mother country which you are now so fond of insulting. she is an empire, and you will soon be an empire also, and only then will you understand each other, and you will realize that you have only one real friend in the world.” it was only two or three years later that there came the cuban war, the episode of manila bay where the british commander joined up with the americans against the germans, and several other incidents which proved the truth of my remarks. a writer of average income is bound to lose pecuniarily upon a lecture tour, even in america, unless he prolongs it very much and works very hard indeed. by losing i do not mean that he is actually out of pocket, but that he could have earned far more if he had never gone outside his own study. in my own case i found after our joint expenses were paid that there was about £1,000 over. the disposal of this money furnished a curious example of the power of prayer, which, as mr. s. s. mcclure has already narrated it, i have no delicacy in telling. he tells how he was endeavouring to run his magazine, how he was down to his last farthing, how he dropped on his knees on the office floor to pray for help, and how on the same day an englishman who was a mere acquaintance walked into the office, and said: “mcclure, i believe in you and in the future of your magazine,” and put down £1,000 on the table. a critic might perhaps observe that under such circumstances to sell 1,000 shares at face value was rather hard upon the ignorant and trusting buyer. for a long time i could clearly see the workings of providence as directed towards sam mcclure, but could not quite get their perspective as regards myself, but i am bound to admit that in the long run, after many vicissitudes, the deal was justified both ways, and i was finally able to sell my holding twenty years later at a reasonable advance. the immediate result, however, was that i returned to davos with all my american earnings locked up, and with no actual visible result of my venture. the davos season was in full blast when i returned, and my wife was holding her own well. it was at this time, in the early months of 1895, that i developed ski-running in switzerland as described in my chapter on sport. we lingered late at davos, so late that i was able to lay out a golf course, which was hampered in its start by the curious trick the cows had of chewing up the red flags. from davos we finally moved to caux, over the lake of geneva, where for some months i worked steadily at my writing. with the autumn i visited england, leaving the ladies at caux, and it was then that events occurred which turned our road of life to a new angle. chapter xiii egypt in 1896 life in egypt--accident--the men who made egypt--up the nile--the salt lakes--adventure in the desert--the coptic monastery--colonel lewis--a surprise. the wretched microbe which had so completely disorganized our lives, and which had produced all the sufferings so patiently borne, now seemed to be latent, and it was hoped that if we spent a winter in egypt the cure might be complete. during this short visit to england, whither i had to rush every now and again in order to adjust my affairs, i met grant allen at luncheon, and he told me that he had also suffered from consumption and that he had found his salvation in the soil and air of hindhead in surrey. it was quite a new idea to me that we might actually live with impunity in england once more, and it was a pleasant thought after resigning oneself to a life which was unnatural to both of us at foreign health resorts. i acted very promptly, for i rushed down to hindhead, bought an admirable plot of ground, put the architectural work into the hands of my old friend and fellow psychic researcher, mr. ball of southsea, and saw the builder chosen and everything in train before leaving england in the autumn of 1895. if egypt was a success, we should have a roof of our own to which to return. the thought of it brought renewed hope to the sufferer. i then set forth, picked up my wife and my sister lottie at caux and took them on by easy stages through italy, stopping a few days at rome, and so to brindisi, where we picked up a boat for egypt. once at cairo we took up our quarters at the mena hotel, in the very shadow of the pyramids, and there we settled down for the winter. i was still doing the brigadier gerard stories at the time, which required a good deal of historical research, but i had brought my materials with me, and all i lacked was the energy, which i found it most difficult to find in that enervating land. on the whole it was a pleasant winter and led up to a most unforeseen climax. i ascended the great pyramid once, and was certainly never tempted to do so again, and was content to watch the struggles of the endless drove of tourists who attempted that uncomfortable and useless feat. there was golf of sorts and there was riding. i was still an immature horseman, but i felt that only practice would help me, so i set forth upon weird steeds provided by the livery stables opposite. as a rule they erred on the side of dulness, but i have a very vivid recollection of one which restored the average. if my right eyelid droops somewhat over my eye it is not the result of philosophic brooding, but it is the doing of a black devil of a horse with a varminty head, slab-sided ribs and restless ears. i disliked the look of the beast, and the moment i threw my leg over him he dashed off as if it were a race. away we went across the desert, i with one foot in the stirrup, holding on as best i might. it is possible i could have kept on until he was weary, but he came suddenly on cultivated land and his forelegs sank in a moment over his fetlocks. the sudden stop threw me over his head, but i held on to the bridle, and he, pawing about with his front hoofs, struck me over the eye, and made a deep star-shaped wound which covered me with blood. i led him back and a pretty sight i presented as i appeared before the crowded verandah! five stitches were needed, but i was thankful, for very easily i might have lost my sight. my wife was well enough now to join in society, while my sister was just at an age to enjoy it, so that we saw a little of the very jovial life of cairo, though the fact that mena is some seven miles out, on the most monotonous road in the world, saved us from any excess. it was always a task to get in and out, so that only a great temptation would draw us. i joined in male society, however, a good deal and learned to know many of those great men who were shaping the new destinies of egypt. i sketched some of them at the time in two paragraphs which may be quoted. “there is a broad and comfortable sofa in the hall of the turf club, and if you sit there about luncheon time you will see a fair sprinkling of anglo-egyptians, men who have helped to make, and are still helping to make, the history of our times. you have a view of the street from where you are, and perhaps in the brilliant sunshine a carriage flies past with two running syces before it and an english coachman upon the box. within, one catches a glimpse of a strong florid face with a close-cropped soldierly grey moustache, the expression good-humoured and inscrutable. this is lord cromer, whom egypt has changed from a major of gunners to a peer of the realm, while he in turn has changed it from a province of the east to one of the west. one has but to look at him to read the secret of his success as a diplomatist. his clear head, his brave heart, his physical health, and his nerves of iron are all impressed upon you even in that momentary glance at his carriage. and that lounging ennuyé attitude is characteristic also--most characteristic at this moment, when few men in the world can have more pressing responsibility upon their shoulders. it is what one could expect from the man who at the most critical moment of recent egyptian history is commonly reported to have brought diplomatic interviews to an abrupt conclusion with the explanation that the time had come for his daily lawn-tennis engagement. it is no wonder that so strong a representative should win the confidence of his own countrymen, but he has made as deep an impression upon the native mind, which finds it difficult under this veiled protectorate of ours to estimate the comparative strength of individuals. ‘suppose khedive tell lord cromer go, lord cromer go?’ asked my donkey-boy, and so put his chocolate finger upon the central point of the whole situation. “but this is a digression from the turf club, where you are seated upon a settee in the hall and watching the englishmen who have done so much to regenerate egypt. of all the singular experiences of this most venerable land, surely this rebuilding at the hands of a little group of bustling, clear-headed anglo-saxons is the most extraordinary. there are garstin and wilcocks, the great water captains who have coaxed the nile to right and to left, until the time seems to be coming when none of its waters will ever reach the mediterranean at all. there is kitchener, tall and straight, a grim silent soldier, with a weal of a dervish bullet upon his face. there you may see rogers, who stamped out the cholera, scott, who reformed the law, palmer, who relieved the over-taxed fellaheen, hooker, who exterminated the locusts, wingate, who knows more than any european of the currents of feeling in the soudan--the same wingate who reached his arm out a thousand miles and plucked slatin out of khartoum. and beside him the small man with the yellow-brown moustache and the cheery, ruddy face is slatin himself, whose one wish in the world now is to have the khalifa at his sword-point--that khalifa at whose heels he had to run for so many weary years.” shortly after the opening of the new year of 1896 we went in one of cook’s boats up the river, getting as far as the outposts of civilization at wady halfa. the banks in the upper reaches were not too safe, as raiders on camels came down at times, but on the water one was secure from all the chances of fate. at the same time i thought that the managers of these tours took undue risks, and when i found myself on one occasion on the rock of abousir with a drove of helpless tourists, male and female, nothing whatever between us and the tribesmen, and a river between us and the nearest troops, i could not but think what an appalling situation would arise if a little troop of these far-riding camel men were to appear. we had four negro soldiers as an escort, who would be helpless before any normal raiding party. it was the strong impression which i there received which gave me the idea of taking a group of people of different types and working out what the effect of so horrible an experience would be upon each. this became “the tragedy of the korosko,” published in america as “a desert drama” and afterwards dramatized with variations as “the fires of fate.” all went well as a matter of fact, but i thought then, and experienced british officers agreed with me, that it was unjustifiable. as the whole frontier force was longing for an excuse to advance, i am not sure that they would not have welcomed it if the dervishes had risen to the ground bait which every week in the same place was laid in front of them. i do not know how many temples we explored during that tour, but they seemed to me endless, some dating back to the mists of antiquity and some as recent as cleopatra and the roman period. the majestic continuity of egyptian history seems to be its most remarkable feature. you examine the tombs of the first dynasty at abydos and there you see carved deep in the stone the sacred hawk, the goose, the plover, the signs of horus and osiris, of upper and lower egypt. these were carved long before the pyramids were built and can hardly be less ancient than 4000 b.c. then you inspect a temple built by the ptolemies, after the date of alexander the great, and there you see the same old symbols cut in the same old way. there is nothing like this in the world. the roman and the british empires are mushrooms in comparison. judged by egyptian standards the days of alfred the great would be next door to our own, and our customs, symbols and way of thinking the same. the race seems to have petrified, and how they could do so without being destroyed by some more virile nation is hard to understand. their arts seem to have been high but their reasoning power in many ways contemptible. the recent discovery of the king’s tomb near thebes--i write in 1924--shows how wonderful were their decorations and the amenities of their lives. but consider the tomb itself. what a degraded intelligence does it not show! the idea that the body, the old outworn greatcoat which was once wrapped round the soul, should at any cost be preserved is the last word in materialism. and the hundred baskets of provisions to feed the soul upon its journey! i can never believe that a people with such ideas could be other than emasculated in their minds--the fate of every nation which comes under the rule of a priesthood. it had been suggested that i should go out to the salt lakes in the desert some 50 miles from cairo, and see the old coptic monastery there. those ancient monasteries, the abode alternately of saints and perverts--we saw specimens of each--have always aroused my keen interest, dating as they do to very early days of christianity. indeed, their date is often unknown, but everything betokens great age and the spirit which founded them seems to have been that of the hermits who in the third and fourth centuries swarmed in these wildernesses. leaving my wife at mena, i went with colonel lewis of the egyptian army, an excellent companion and guide. on arriving at a wayside station, we found a most amazing vehicle awaiting us, a sort of circus coach, all gilding and frippery. it proved to be the coach of state which had been prepared for napoleon iii on the chance that he would come to open the suez canal. it was surely a good bit of work, for here it was still strong and fit, but absurdly out of place in the majestic simplicity of the libyan desert. into this we got and set forth, the only guide being wheel-marks across the sand which in some of the harder places were almost invisible. the great sand waste rolled in yellow billows all around us, and far behind us the line of green trees marked the course of the nile. once a black dot appeared which, as it grew nearer, proved to be some sort of oriental on foot. as he came up to us he opened a blackened mouth, pointed to it, and cried, “moya! moya!” which means water. we had none and could only point encouragingly to the green belt behind us, on which with a curse he staggered upon his way. a surprising adventure befell us, for the heavens suddenly clouded over and rain began to fall, an almost unknown thing in those parts. we lumbered on, however, with our two horses, while colonel lewis, who was keen on getting fit, ran behind. i remember saying to him that in my wildest dreams i never thought that i should drive across the libyan desert in an emperor’s coach with a full colonel as carriage dog. presently in the fading light the horses slowed down, the nubian driver descended, and began alternately scanning the ground and making gestures of despair. we realized then that he had lost the tracks and therefore that we had no notion where we were, though we had strong reasons to believe that we were to the south of the route. the difficulty was to know which was north and which south. it was an awkward business since we had no food or water and could see no end to our troubles. the further we moved the deeper we should be involved. night had closed in, and i was looking up at the drifting scud above us when in the chink of two clouds i saw for an instant a cluster of stars, and made sure that they were the four wheels of charles’s wain. i am no astronomer, but i reasoned that this constellation would lie to the north of us, and so it proved, for when we headed that way, examining the ground every hundred yards or so with matches, we came across the track once more. our adventures, however, were not over, and it was all like a queer dream. we had great difficulty in keeping the track in the darkness, and the absurd coach lumbered and creaked while we walked with lanterns ahead of it. suddenly to our joy we saw a bright light in the gloom. we quickened our pace, and came presently to a tent with a florid-bearded man seated outside it beside a little table where he was drawing by the light of a lamp. the rain had cleared now, but the sky was still overcast. in answer to our hail this man rather gruffly told us that he was a german surveyor at work in the desert. he motioned with his hand when we told him whither we were bound, and said it was close by. after leaving him we wandered on, and losing the tracks we were again very badly bushed. it seemed an hour or two before to our joy we saw a light ahead and prepared for a night’s rest at the halfway house, which was our immediate destination. but when we reached the light what we saw was a florid bearded man sitting outside a small tent with a lamp upon a table. we had moved in a circle. fresh explanations--and this time we really did keep to the track and reached a big deserted wooden hut, where we put up the horses, ate some cold food, and tumbled, very tired, into two of the bunks which lined it. the morrow made amends for all. it broke cold and clear and i have seldom felt a greater sense of exhilaration than when i awoke and walking out before dressing saw the whole endless desert stretching away on every side of me, yellow sand and black rock, to the blue shimmering horizon. we harnessed up and within a few hours came on the natron lake, a great salt lake, with a few scattered houses at one end where the workers dry out and prepare the salt. a couple of miles off was the lonely monastery which we had come to see--less lonely now, but before the salt works were established one of the most inaccessible places one could imagine. it consisted of a huge outer wall, which seemed to be made of hardened clay. it had no doors or windows save one little opening which could be easily defended against the prowling arabs, but i fear the garrison would not be very stout-hearted, for it was said to be the fear of military service which caused many of the monks to discover that they had a vocation. on being admitted i was conscious that we were not too welcome, though the military title of my companion commanded respect. we were shown round the inner courtyard, where there were palm trees and a garden, and then round the scattered houses within the wall. near the latter there was, i remember, a barrel full of some substance which seemed to me, both by look and feel, to be rounded pieces of some light stone, and i asked if it were to hurl down at the arabs if they attacked the door. it proved to be the store of bread for the monastery. we were treated to wine, which was sweet tent wine, which is still used, i believe, in the holy communion, showing how straight our customs come from the east. the abbot seemed to me to be a decent man, but he complained of illness and was gratified when i overhauled him thoroughly, percussed his chest, and promised to send him out some medicine from cairo. i did so, but whether it ever reached my remote patient i never learned. some of the brothers, however, looked debauched, and there was a general air of nothing-to-do, which may have been deceptive but which certainly impressed me that day. as i looked from the walls and saw the desert on all sides, unbroken save for one blue corner of the salt lake, it was strange to consider that this was all which these men would ever see of the world, and to contrast their fate with my own busy and varied existence. there was a library, but the books were scattered on the floor, all of them old and some no doubt rare. since the discovery of the “codex sinaiticus” i presume that all these old coptic libraries have been examined by scholars, but it certainly seemed to me that there might be some valuable stuff in that untidy heap. next evening colonel lewis and i were back in cairo. we heard no news upon the way, and we had reached the turf club and were in the cloak room washing our hands before dinner when some man came in and said: “why, lewis, how is it you are not with your brigade?” “my brigade!” “have you been away?” “yes, at the natron lakes.” “good heavens! have you heard nothing?” “no.” “why, man, war is declared. we are advancing on dongola. the whole army is concentrating on the frontier, and you are in command of an advanced brigade.” “good god!” lewis’s soap splashed into the water, and i wonder he did not fall plump on the floor. thus it was that we learned of the next adventure which was opening up before both us and the british empire. chapter xiv on the edge of a storm the storm centre--to the frontier--assouan--excited officers--with the press men--a long camel ride--night marches--halfa--gwynne of the “morning post”--anley--a sudden voyage--apricots and rousseau. it is impossible to be near great historical events and not to desire to take part in them, or at the least to observe them. egypt had suddenly become the storm centre of the world, and chance had placed me there at that moment. clearly i could not remain in cairo, but must get up by hook or by crook to the frontier. it was march and the weather would soon be too warm for my wife, but she was good enough to say that she would wait with my sister until april if i would promise to return by then. at that time the general idea was that some great event would at once occur, though looking back one can see that that was hardly possible. anyhow i had a great urge to go south. there was only one way to do it. the big morning papers had their men already upon the spot. but it was less likely that the evening papers were provided. i cabled to the “westminster gazette” asking to be made their honorary correspondent _pro tem._ i had a cable back assenting. armed with this i approached the proper authority, and so within a day or two i was duly appointed and everything was in order. i had to make my own way up and i had to get together some sort of kit. the latter was done hurriedly and was of fearsome quality. i bought a huge revolver of italian make with a hundred cartridges, an ugly unreliable weapon. i bought also a water bottle, which was made of new resinous wood and gave a most horrible flavour of turpentine to everything put into it. it was like drinking varnish, but before i got back there were times when i was ready to drink varnish or anything else that was damp. with a light khaki coat, riding breeches, a small valise, and the usual christmas tree hung round me, i started off from cairo by train to assiout, where a small river boat was waiting. it was filled with officers going to the front, and we had a pleasant few days journeying to assouan together. there were, i remember, several junior officers who have since made names in the world, maxwell (now general sir john maxwell) and hickman, who also rose to the top. there was a young cavalry lieutenant also, one smythe, who seemed to me to be too gentle and quiet for such rough work as lay ahead. the next time i heard of him was when he was gazetted for the victoria cross. in soldiering there is nothing more deceptive than appearances. your fierce, truculent man may always have a yellow streak where the gentle student has a core of steel. there lay one of the many mistakes which the germans made later in judging those “unwarlike islanders” the british. the great question at the opening of the campaign was whether the native fellah troops would stand. the five negro battalions were as good as could be, but the record of the eight or nine egyptian ones was not reassuring. the arab of the soudan is a desperate fanatic who rushes to death with the frenzy of a madman, and longs for close quarters where he can bury his spear in the body of his foeman, even though he carries several bullets in him before he reaches him. would the egyptians stand such onslaughts as these? it was thought improbable that they would, and so british battalions, the connaughts, the staffords and others, were brought up to stiffen their battle line. one great advantage the native soldiers had--and without it their case would have been hopeless--and that was that their officers were among the picked men of the british army. kitchener would have none but the unmarried, for it was to be a wholehearted and if need be a desperate service, and, as the pay and life were good, he could accept or reject as he chose, so that his leaders were splendid. it was curious to see their fair faces and flaxen moustaches under the red tarbooshes, as they marched at the side of their men. the relations between these officers and their men were paternal. if an officer of black troops came to cairo he would go back with a pillow case stuffed with candies for his men. the egyptians were more inscrutable, less sporting and less lovable, but none the less their officers were very loyal to them, and bitterly resented the distrust shown by the rest of the army. one british officer at some early battle seized the enemy’s flag and cried: “well, the english shall not have this anyhow.” it is this spirit, whether in egypt or in india, which makes the british officer an ideal leader of native troops. even at the great indian mutiny they would not hear a word against their men until they were murdered by them. at assouan we were held up for a week, and no one was allowed to go further. we were already well within the radius of the arab raiders, for in the last year they had struck even further north. the desert is like the sea, for if you have the camels, which correspond to the ships, your blow may fall anywhere and your attack is not suspected until the moment that you appear. the crowd of british officers who were waiting seemed little worried by any such possibility and were as unconcerned as if it was a cook’s tour and not a particularly dangerous expedition--so dangerous that of the last army which went south, that of hicks pasha, hardly one single man was ever seen again. only once did i see them really excited. i had returned to the hotel which was the general head-quarters, and as i entered the hall i saw a crowd of them all clustering round the notice board to read a telegram which had just been suspended. they were on the toes of their spurred boots, with their necks outstretched and every sign of quivering and eager interest. “ah,” thought i, “at last we have got through the hide of these impenetrable men. i suppose the khalifa is coming down, horse, foot, and artillery, and that we are on the eve of battle.” i pushed my way in, and thrust my head among all the bobbing sun-helmets. it was the account of the oxford and cambridge boat-race. i was struck by the splendid zeal of every one. it was an inspiration. hickman had been full of combative plans all the way on the boat. when we arrived there was a message for him to go down to keneh and buy camels. here was a drop down for a man all on fire for action. “it is quite right,” said he, when i condoled with him. “the force must have camels. i am the man to buy them. we all work for one end.” self-abnegation of this sort is general. the british officer at his best is really a splendid fellow, a large edition of the public schoolboy, with his cheery slang overlying a serious purpose which he would usually die rather than admit. i heard of three of them at rail-end, all doing essential work and all with a degree of fever on them which might well have excused them from work altogether. every evening each of them dropped a dollar into a hat, they then all took their temperatures and the highest got the pool. assouan is at the foot of the cataract, which extends for some 30 miles, and everything has to be transhipped and taken on a narrow toy railway to be reloaded on fresh steamers at shellal. it was a huge task and i remember sympathizing with captain morgan, who with fatigue parties of egyptians and chain gangs of convicts was pushing the stuff through. morgan had sold me a horse once and was shy of me in consequence, but he soon saw that i bore no grudge. _caveat emptor!_ i already saw in him those qualities of organization which made him a real factor both in the boer and in the european war. he has just died a general and full of honours. i remember seeing the 7th egyptians after a long gruelling desert march working at those stores until they were so played out that it took four of them to raise a sixty-pound biscuit box. the big pressmen had now arrived--“where the carcass is there shall the eagles, etc.”--and i had luckily made friends with them, so it was determined that we should all go on together. there were five of us who started out, led by knight of the “falcon,” representing “the times,” and looking not unlike a falcon himself. he was a great man, tall and muscular, a famous yachtsman and treasure-seeker, traveller, fighter and scholar. he had just left the french in madagascar. next came scudamore of the “daily news,” small, celtic, mercurial, full of wit and go. he was a great purchaser of camels, which were of course all paid for by the paper, so that when robinson, the editor of the “daily news,” heard of the boer war his first comment was, “well, thank god, there are no camels in south africa.” it was a study in eastern ways to see scudamore buying camels, and i learned from him how it is done. an arab leads up the absurd-looking creature. you look deprecatingly at the beast--and you cannot take a better model than the creature’s own expression as it looks at you. you ask how much is wanted for it. the owner says £16. you then give a shriek of derision, sweep your arm across as if to wave him and his camel out of your sight for ever, and turning with a whisk you set off rapidly in the other direction. how far you go depends upon the price asked. if it is really very high, you may not get back for your dinner. but as a rule a hundred yards or so meet the case, and you shape your course so as to reach the camel and its owner. you stop in front of them and look at them with a disinterested and surprised look to intimate that you wonder that they should still be loitering there. the arab asks how much you will give. you answer £8. then it is his turn to scream, whisk round, and do his hundred yards, his absurd chattel with its horn-pipey legs trotting along behind him. but he returns to say that he will take fourteen, and off you go again with a howl and a wave. so the bargaining goes on, the circles continually shortening, until you have settled upon the middle price. but it is only when you have bought your camel that the troubles begin. it is the strangest and most deceptive animal in the world. its appearance is so staid and respectable that you cannot give it credit for the black villany that lurks within. it approaches you with a mildly interested and superior expression, like a patrician lady in a sunday school. you feel that a pair of glasses at the end of a fan is the one thing lacking. then it puts its lips gently forward, with a far-away look in its eyes, and you have just time to say, “the pretty dear is going to kiss me,” when two rows of frightful green teeth clash in front of you, and you give such a backward jump as you could never have hoped at your age to accomplish. when once the veil is dropped, anything more demoniacal than the face of a camel cannot be conceived. no kindness and no length of ownership seem to make them friendly. and yet you must make allowances for a creature which can carry 600 lb. for 20 miles a day, and ask for no water and little food at the end of it. this, however, is digression. the other pressmen were beaman of the “standard,” fresh from constantinople, and almost an eastern in his ways, and julian corbett, representing the “pall mall,” a gentle and amiable man who was destined later to be the naval historian of the great war. like myself he was an amateur among professionals, and had to return within a given date to cairo. as it was clear that nothing important could take place instantly, we determined to do part of the journey by road. a force of cavalry was going up, and we were ordered to join them and use them as an escort, but we thought we would be happier on our own, and so we managed to lose the egyptians. there was some risk in our lonely journey along the right bank of the river with our left flank quite unprotected, but on the other hand the dust of a great body of horsemen would be insufferable. therefore we set forth one evening, mounted upon our camels, with baggage camels in attendance, and quite a retinue of servants. in four or five days we reached korosko, where we got boats which took us to the frontier at wady halfa, while the camels and servants came on by land. i shall never forget those days, or rather those nights, for we rose at two in the morning and our longest march was before or during the dawn. i am still haunted by that purple velvet sky, by those enormous and innumerable stars, by the half-moon which moved slowly above us, while our camels with their noiseless tread seemed to bear us without effort through a wonderful dream world. scudamore had a beautiful rolling baritone voice, and i can still hear it in my memory as it rose and fell in the still desert air. it was a wonderful vision, an intermezzo in real life, broken only once by my performing the unusual feat of falling off a camel. i have taken many tosses off horses, but this was a new experience. you have no proper saddle, but are seated upon a curved leather tray, so that when my brute suddenly threw himself down on his fore-knees--he had seen some green stuff on the path--i shot head foremost down his neck. it was like coming down a hose pipe in some acrobatic performance, and i reached the ground rather surprised but otherwise none the worse. one or two pictures rise in mind. one was of some strange aquatic lizard--not a crocodile--lying on a sand bank. i cracked off my italian revolver, which was more likely to hurt me than the lizard, and i saw the strange beast writhe into the stream. once again, as i settled my couch at night, i saw a slug-like creature, with horned projections, the length about 18 inches, which moved away and disappeared. it was a death adder--the sort perhaps which took cleopatra to her fathers. then again we went into a ruined hut to see if we could sleep there. in the dim light of our candle we saw a creature which i thought was a mouse rush round and round the floor, close to the wall. then suddenly to my amazement it ran right up the wall and down again on to the floor. it was a huge spider, which now stood waving its fore-legs at us. to my horror scudamore sprang into the air, and came down upon it, squashing it into a square foot of filth. this was the real tarantula, a dangerous creature, and common enough in such places. yet another picture comes very clearly back to me. for some reason we had not started in the night, and the early dawn found us still resting in our small camp in a grove of palm trees near the path which led along the bank of the nile. i awoke, and, lying in my blankets, i saw an amazing man riding along this path. he was a negroid nubian, a huge, fierce, hollow-cheeked creature, with many silver ornaments upon him. a long rifle projected over his back and a sword hung from his side. a more sinister barbaric figure one could not imagine, and he was exactly the type of those mahdi raiders against whom we had been warned. i never like to be an alarmist, especially among men who had seen much of war or danger, so i said nothing, but i managed to stir one of my companions, who sighted the newcomer with a muttered “my god!” the man rode past us and on northwards, never glancing at our grove. i have no doubt that he was really one of our own native tribesmen, for we had some in our pay; but had he been the other thing our fate would have been sealed. i wrote a short story, “the three correspondents,” which was suggested by the incident. a strange wooden-faced turkish soldier, yussuf bey, in the egyptian service, commanding the troops at korosko, had us up in audience, gave us long pink glasses of raspberry vinegar, and finally saw us on board the boat which in a day or two deposited us on the busy river-bank of wady halfa, where the same military bustle prevailed as we had left behind us at assouan. halfa lies also at the base of a cataract, and again all the stuff had to be transhipped and sent on thirty miles by a little track to sarras. i walked the first day to the small station where the track began and i saw a tall officer in a white jacket and red tarboosh, who with a single orderly was superintending the work and watching the stores pass into the trucks. he turned a fierce red face upon me and i saw that it was kitchener himself, the commander of the whole army. it was characteristic of the man that he did not leave such vital things to chance, or to the assurance of some subordinate, but that he made sure so far as he could with his own eyes that he really had the tools for the job that lay before him. learning who i was--we had met once before on the racecourse at cairo--he asked me to dinner in his tent that night, when he discussed the coming campaign with great frankness. i remember that his chief-of-staff--drage, i think, was the name--sat beside me and was so completely played out that he fell asleep between every course. i remember also the amused smile with which kitchener regarded him. you had to go all out when you served such a master. one new acquaintance whom i made in those days was herbert gwynne, a newly-fledged war correspondent, acting, if i remember right, for the “chronicle.” i saw that he had much in him. when i heard of him next he was reuter’s man in the boer war, and not very long afterwards he had become editor of the “morning post,” where he now is. those days in halfa were the beginning of a friendship of thirty years, none the less real because we are both too busy to meet. one of the joys of the hereafter is, i think, that we have time to cultivate our friends. i was friendly also with a very small but gallant officer, one anley, who had just joined the egyptian army. his career was beginning and i foresaw that he would rise, but should have been very surprised had i known how we should meet again. i was standing in the ranks by the roadside as a private of volunteers in the great war when a red-tabbed, brass-hatted general passed. he looked along our ranks, his gaze fastened on me, and lo, it was anley. surprised out of all military etiquette, he smiled and nodded. what is a private in the ranks to do when a general smiles and nods? he can’t formally stand to attention or salute. i fear that what i did was to close and then open my left eye. that was how i learned that my egyptian captain was now a war brigadier. we pushed on to sarras and had a glimpse of the actual outpost of civilization, all sandbags and barbed wire, for there was a mahdi post at no distance up the river. it was wonderful to look south and to see distant peaks said to be in dongola, with nothing but savagery and murder lying between. there was a whiff of real war in the little fortress but no sign of any actual advance. indeed, i had the assurance of kitchener himself that there was no use my waiting and that nothing could possibly happen until the camels were collected--many thousands of them. i contributed my own beast to the army’s need since i had no further use for it, and corbett and i prepared to take our leave. we were warned that our only course was to be on the look out and take a flying jump on to any empty cargo boat which was going down stream. this we did one morning, carrying our scanty belongings. once on board we learned that there was no food and that the boat did not stop for several days. the rope had not been cast off, so i rushed to the only shop available, a greek store of a type which springs up like mushrooms on the track of an army. they were sold out save for tinned apricots, of which i bought several tins. i rushed back and scrambled on board as the boat cast off. we managed to get some arab bread from the boatmen, and that with the apricots served us all the way. i never wish to see a tinned apricot so long as i live. i associate their cloying sweetness with rousseau’s “confessions,” a french edition of which came somehow into my hands and was my only reading till i saw assouan once more. rousseau also i never wish to read again. so that was the end of our frontier adventure. we had been on the edge of war but not in it. it was disappointing, but it was late in april before i reached cairo and the heat was already becoming too much for an invalid. a week later we were in london, and i remember that, as i sat as a guest at the royal academy banquet on may 1 of that year, i saw upon my wrists the ragged little ulcers where the poisonous jiggers which had burrowed into my skin while i lay upon the banks of the nile were hatching out their eggs under the august roof of burlington house. chapter xv an interlude of peace hindhead--“a duet”--a haunted house--a curious society--preternatural powers--the little doctor--the shadow of africa. when we returned to england i found that the house in which we hoped that the cure would be completed was not yet ready. it was a considerable mansion planned upon a large scale, so that it was not surprising that it had taken some time to build. we were compelled to take a furnished house at haslemere until the early months of 1897, when we moved up to moorlands, a boarding house on hindhead close to the site of my building. there we spent some happy and busy months until the house was ready in the summer. i had taken up riding, and though i was never a great horseman i was able from that time onwards to get a good deal of health and pleasure out of it, for in that woody, healthy country there are beautiful rides in every direction, and the hunting, in which i joined, was at least picturesque. about june we moved into the new house, which i called undershaw--a new word, i think, and yet one which described it exactly in good anglo-saxon, since it stood under a hanging grove of trees. i have said little, during these years spent in the quest of health, concerning my literary production. the chief book which i had written since “the refugees” was a study of the regency with its bucks and prizefighters. i had always a weakness for the old fighting men and for the lore of the prize-ring, and i indulged it in this novel. at the time boxing had not gained the popular vogue which i have been told that this very book first initiated, and i can never forget the surprise of sir george newnes when he found out what the new serial was about. “why that subject of all subjects upon earth?” he cried. however, i think that the readers of “the strand” found that i had not chosen badly, and the book is one which has held a permanent place as a picture of those wild old days. i wrote a considerable number of short tales during those years, and finally in 1898 a domestic study, “a duet,” which was an attempt at quite a different form of literature--a picture in still life, as it were. it was partly imaginative and partly founded upon early experiences of my own and of friends. it led, i remember, to a public bickering with a man who has done good work as a critic, dr. robertson nicoll. he took exception to some passage in the book, which he had every right to do. but he wrote at that time for six or seven papers, under different names, so that it appeared as if a number of critics were all condemning me when it was really only one. i thought i had a grievance, and said so with such vehemence that he stated that he did not know whether to answer me in print or in the law courts. however, it all blew over and we became very good friends. another book of those days was “uncle bernac,” which i never felt to be satisfactory, though i venture to claim that the two chapters which portray napoleon give a clearer picture of him than many a long book has done, which is natural enough, since they are themselves the quintessence of a score of books. so much for my work. i had everything in those few years to make a man contented, save only the constant illness of my partner. and yet my soul was often troubled within me. i felt that i was born for something else, and yet i was not clear what that something might be. my mind felt out continually into the various religions of the world. i could no more get into the old ones, as commonly received, than a man could get into his boy’s suit. i still argued on materialist lines. i subscribed to the rationalist association and read all their literature carefully, but it was entirely destructive and one cannot permanently live on that alone. besides, i was sure enough of psychic phenomena to be aware that there was a range of experience there which was entirely beyond any rational explanation, and that therefore a system which ignored a great body of facts, and was incompatible with them, was necessarily an imperfect system. on the other hand, convinced as i was of these abnormal happenings, and that intelligence, high or low, lay behind them, i by no means understood their bearing. i still confused the knocking at the door with the friend outside, or the ringing of the bell with the telephone message. sometimes i had the peace of despair, when one felt that one could never possibly arrive at any conclusions save negative ones, and then again some fresh impulse of the soul would start one upon a new quest. in every direction, i reached out, but never yet with any absolute satisfaction. i should have been relieved from all my troubles could i have given heartfelt adhesion to any form of orthodoxy--but my reason always barred the way. during all the egyptian and other periods of our exile i had never ceased to take the psychic subject very seriously, to read eagerly all that i could get, and from time to time to organize séances which gave indifferent but not entirely negative results, though we had no particular medium to help us. the philosophy of the subject began slowly to unfold, and it was gradually made more feasible, not only that life carried on, enclosed in some more tenuous envelope, but that the conditions which it encountered in the beyond were not unlike those which it had known here. so far i had got along the road, but the overwhelming and vital importance of it all had not yet been borne in upon me. now and then i had a psychic experience somewhat outside the general run of such events. one of these occurred when i was at norwood in 1892 or 1893. i was asked by the society of psychic research whether i would join a small committee to sit in and report upon a haunted house at charmouth in dorchester. i went down accordingly together with a dr. scott and mr. podmore, a man whose name was associated with such investigations. i remember that it took us the whole railway journey from paddington to read up the evidence as to the senseless noises which had made life unendurable for the occupants, who were tied by a lease and could not get away. we sat up there two nights. on the first nothing occurred. on the second dr. scott left us and i sat up with mr. podmore. we had, of course, taken every precaution to checkmate fraud, putting worsted threads across the stairs, and so on. in the middle of the night a fearsome uproar broke out. it was like some one belabouring a resounding table with a heavy cudgel. it was not an accidental creaking of wood, or anything of that sort, but a deafening row. we had all doors open, so we rushed at once into the kitchen, from which the sound had surely come. there was nothing there--doors were all locked, windows barred, and threads unbroken. podmore took away the light and pretended that we had both returned to our sitting-room, going off with the young master of the house, while i waited in the dark in the hope of a return of the disturbance. none came--or ever did come. what occasioned it we never knew. it was of the same character as all the other disturbances we had read about, but shorter in time. but there was a sequel to the story. some years later the house was burned down, which may or may not have a bearing upon the sprite which seemed to haunt it, but a more suggestive thing is that the skeleton of a child about ten years old was dug up in the garden. this i give on the authority of a relation of the family who were so plagued. the suggestion was that the child had been done to death there long ago, and that the subsequent phenomena of which we had one small sample were in some way a sequence to this tragedy. there is a theory that a young life cut short in sudden and unnatural fashion may leave, as it were, a store of unused vitality which may be put to strange uses. the unknown and the marvellous press upon us from all sides. they loom above us and around us in undefined and fluctuating shapes, some dark, some shimmering, but all warning us of the limitations of what we call matter, and of the need for spirituality if we are to keep in touch with the true inner facts of life. i was never asked for a report of this case, but podmore sent one in, attributing the noises to the young man, though as a fact he was actually sitting with us in the parlour when the tumult broke out. a confederate was possible, though we had taken every step to bar it, but the explanation given was absolutely impossible. i learned from this, what i have often confirmed since, that while we should be most critical of all psychic assertions, if we are to get at the truth, we should be equally critical of all negatives and especially of so-called “exposures” in this subject. again and again i have probed them and found them to depend upon prejudice or upon an imperfect acquaintance with psychic law. this brings me to another curious experience which occurred about this time, probably in 1898. there was a small doctor dwelling near me, small in stature, and also, i fear, in practice, whom i will call brown. he was a student of the occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learning that he had one room in his house which no one entered except himself, as it was reserved for mystic and philosophic purposes. finding that i was interested in such subjects, dr. brown suggested one day that i should join a secret society of esoteric students. the invitation had been led up to by a good deal of preparatory inquiry. the dialogue between us ran somewhat thus: “what shall i get from it?” “in time, you will get powers.” “what sort of powers?” “they are powers which people would call supernatural. they are perfectly natural, but they are got by knowledge of deeper forces of nature.” “if they are good, why should not every one know them?” “they would be capable of great abuse in the wrong hands.” “how can you prevent their getting into wrong hands?” “by carefully examining our initiates.” “should i be examined?” “certainly.” “by whom?” “the people would be in london.” “should i have to present myself?” “no, no, they would do it without your knowledge.” “and after that?” “you would then have to study.” “study what?” “you would have to learn by heart a considerable mass of material. that would be the first thing.” “if this material is in print, why does it not become public property?” “it is not in print. it is in manuscript. each manuscript is carefully numbered and trusted to the honour of a passed initiate. we have never had a case of one going wrong.” “well,” said i, “it is very interesting and you can go ahead with the next step, whatever it may be.” some little time later--it may have been a week--i awoke in the very early morning with a most extraordinary sensation. it was not a nightmare or any prank of a dream. it was quite different from that, for it persisted after i was wide awake. i can only describe it by saying that i was tingling all over. it was not painful, but it was queer and disagreeable, as a mild electric shock would be. i thought at once of the little doctor. in a few days i had a visit from him. “you have been examined and you have passed,” said he with a smile. “now you must say definitely whether you will go on with it. you can’t take it up and drop it. it is serious, and you must leave it alone or go forward with a whole heart.” it began to dawn upon me that it really was serious, so serious that there seemed no possible space for it in my very crowded and pre-occupied life. i said as much, and he took it in very good part. “very well,” said he, “we won’t talk of it any more unless you change your mind.” there was a sequel to the story. a month or two later, on a pouring wet day, the little doctor called, bringing with him another medical man whose name was familiar to me in connection with exploration and tropical service. they sat together beside my study fire and talked. one could not but observe that the famous and much-travelled man was very deferential to the little country surgeon, who was the younger of the two. “he is one of my initiates,” said the latter to me. “you know,” he continued, turning to his companion, “doyle nearly joined us once.” the other looked at me with great interest and then at once plunged into a conversation with his mentor as to the wonders he had seen and, as i understood, actually done. i listened amazed. it sounded like the talk of two lunatics. one phrase stuck in my memory. “when first you took me up with you,” said he, “and we were hovering over the town i used to live in, in central africa, i was able for the first time to see the islands out in the lake. i always knew they were there, but they were too far off to be seen from the shore. was it not extraordinary that i should first see them when i was living in england?” “yes,” said brown, smoking his pipe and staring into the fire. “we had some fun in those days. do you remember how you laughed when we made the little steamboat and it ran along the upper edge of the clouds?” there were other remarks as wild. “a conspiracy to impress a simpleton,” says the sceptic. well, we can leave it at that if the sceptic so wills, but i remain under the impression that i brushed against something strange, and something which i am not sorry that i avoided. it was not spiritualism and it was not theosophy, but rather the acquisition of powers latent in the human organization, after the alleged fashion of the old gnostics or of some modern fakirs in india, though some doubtless would spell fakirs with an “e.” one thing i am very sure of, and that is that morals and ethics have to keep pace with knowledge, or all is lost. the maori cannibals had psychic knowledge and power, but were man-eaters none the less. christian _ethics_ can never lose its place whatever expansion our psychic faculties may enjoy. but christian theology can and will. to return to the little doctor, i came across him again, as psychic as ever, in portland, oregon, in 1923. from what i learned i should judge that the powers of the society to which he belonged included that of loosening their own etheric bodies, in summoning the etheric bodies of others (mine, for example) and in making thought images (the steamboat) in the way that we are assured is possible by will-power. but their line of philosophy or development is beyond me. i believe they represent a branch of the rosicrucians. all seemed placid at this time. my wife was holding her own in winter as well as in summer. the two children, mary and kingsley, were passing through the various sweet phases of human development, and brought great happiness into our lives. the country was lovely. my life was filled with alternate work and sport. as with me so with the nation. they were years of prosperity and success. but the shadow of south africa was falling upon england, and before it passed my personal fortunes, as well as so many more, were destined to be involved in it. i had a deep respect for the boers and some fear of their skill at arms, their inaccessible situation, and their sturdy teutonic tenacity. i foresaw that they would be a most dangerous enemy, and i watched with horror the drift of events which from the time of the ill-judged jameson raid never ceased to lead to open war. it was almost a relief when at last it came and we could clearly see the magnitude of our task. and yet few people understood it at the time. on the very eve of war i took the chair at a dinner to lord wolseley at the authors’ club and he declared that we could send two divisions to africa. the papers next day were all much exercised as to whether such a force was either possible to collect or necessary to send. what would they have thought had they been told that a quarter of a million men, a large proportion of them cavalry, would be needed before victory could be won. the early boer victories surprised no one who knew something of south african history, and they made it clear to every man in england that it was not a wine glass but a rifle which one must grasp if the health of the empire was to be honoured. chapter xvi the start for south africa the black week--volunteering--the langman hospital--the voyage-- bloemfontein--sir claude de crespigny--the epidemic--advance to the water works. from december 10 to 17, 1899, was the black week for england. in that week general gatacre lost a battle at stormberg, lord methuen lost one at magersfontein and general buller lost one at colenso. the three together would not have made more than a minor action in the great war to come, but at the time it seemed portentous. there were ominous stirrings on the continent also and rumours of a coalition. it was lucky for us that the german fleet was not yet in being and that our own was able to keep the ring, or we should soon have had some lafayette in south africa with perhaps a yorktown to follow. however, it was bad enough as it was, but the nation as usual rose splendidly to the occasion, and every one hastened to do what they could. hence it was that i found myself early one morning at hounslow--if i remember right--standing in a long queue of men who were waiting to enlist in the middlesex yeomanry. i had one or two friends in the regiment and hence my choice. the colonel, a grizzled soldier, sat behind a deal table in an orderly room and dealt swiftly with the applicants. he had no idea who i was, but seeing a man of forty before him he intimated that i surely did not intend to go into the ranks. i said that i was prepared to take a commission. he asked if i could ride and shoot. i said that i could do both in moderation. he asked if i had had military experience. i said that i had led an adventurous life and seen a little of military operations in the soudan, which was stretching it about as far as it would go. two white lies are permitted to a gentleman, to screen a woman, or to get into a fight when the fight is a rightful one. so i trust i may be forgiven. however the colonel would only put me on his waiting list, took my name, still without recognizing me, and passed on to the next case. i departed somewhat crestfallen and unsettled, not knowing whether i had heard the last of the matter or not. almost immediately afterwards, however, i received an offer which took me out in a capacity which was less sporting but probably in my case and at my age a good deal more useful. this came from my friend john langman, whose son archie i had known well in davos days. langman was sending out a hospital of fifty beds at his own expense to africa, and had already chosen his staff of surgeons but not his personnel. archie langman was to go with the hospital as general manager. langman’s idea was that i should help him to choose the personnel, that i should be a supplementary medico, and that i should exercise a general supervision over the whole in an unofficial capacity. to all this i agreed and spent a week at his house at stanhope terrace choosing from many candidates those who seemed the most likely. on the whole they proved to be a worthy choice. there were many things to be done, and in the middle of them i received a note reopening the question of the yeomanry, but by this time i was entirely committed to the langman hospital. when we were complete we were quite a good little unit, but our weakness was unfortunately at the head. dr. o’callaghan had been a personal friend of langman’s and had thus got the senior billet, but he was in truth an excellent gynæcologist, which is a branch of the profession for which there seemed to be no immediate demand. he was a man too who had led a sedentary life and was not adapted, with all the will in the world, for the trying experience which lay before us. he realized this himself and returned to england after a short experience of south african conditions. we were compelled to have one military chief, as a bond with the war office, and this proved to be one major drury, a most amusing irishman who might have come right out of lever. to leave the service and to “marry a rich widow with a cough” was, he said, the height of his ambition. he was a very pleasant companion in civil life, but when it came to duties which needed tact and routine he was rather too celtic in his methods, and this led to friction and occasional rows in which i had to sustain the point of view of mr. langman. i have no doubt he thought me an insubordinate dog, and i thought him--well, he has passed away now, and i remember him best as a very amusing companion. under o’callaghan and drury were two really splendid younger surgeons, charles gibbs and scharlieb, the latter the son of the well-known lady doctor. they were as good as they could be. then we had our ward-masters, cooks, stewards, storekeepers, and finally some fifteen to twenty orderlies. altogether we numbered just fifty men, and were splendidly fitted out by the generosity of mr. langman. a month or two passed before we could get away, and i remember one amusing incident which occurred during that time. i had spent a good deal of thought over the problem how best to attack men who lay concealed behind cover. my conclusions were that it was useless to fire at them direct, since, if they knew their business, very little of them would be vulnerable. on the other hand, if one could turn a rifle into a portable howitzer and drop a bullet with any sort of rough general accuracy within a given area, then it seemed to me that life would hardly be possible within that area. if, for example, the position was 20,000 square yards in size, and 20,000 rifles were dropping bullets upon it, each square yard would sooner or later be searched and your mark would be a whole prostrate or crouching body. what i was really evolving, though i could not know it, was the machine gun barrage of dropping or vertical fire as practised in the great war. my principles were absolutely right and have not even yet received their full application. i wrote an article to “the times” explaining my views, but so far as i know it had no results. meanwhile i was practising how to turn a rifle into a howitzer. i fastened a large needle at the end of a thread to the back sight. when the gun pointed straight up in the air the needle swung down across the stock and i marked the spot. then the idea was to tilt the gun slowly forward, marking advances of 200, 400 and so on in the range, so that you had a dial marked on the stock and could always by letting the needle fall across the correct mark on the dial drop the bullet within a certain distance. but the crux was to discover the exact ranges. to do this i went down to frensham pond and, standing among the reeds and tilting the gun very slightly forward, i pulled the trigger. the bullet very nearly fell upon my own head. i could not locate it, but i heard quite a loud thud. but what amazed me, and still amazes me, was the time it took. i counted fifty seconds on my watch between the discharge and the fall. i don’t wonder if the reader is incredulous. i feel incredulous also, but such is the fact as i recorded it. my idea was to mark the bullet splashes on the calm water of the lake, but though i fired and fired at various angles not a splash could i see. finally a little man who may have been an artist broke in upon my solitude. “do you want to know where those bullets are going?” “yes, sir, i do.” “then i can tell you, sir, for they have been dropping all round _me_.” i felt that unless my howitzer was to claim its first victim on the spot i had better stop. it was clear that the light bullet with so heavy a charge went so high into the atmosphere that one lost all command over it. twice the weight and half the charge would have served my purpose better. then came other calls and i could never work it out, but i am very sure that with a little care in detail i could have got a converging fire which would have cleared any kopje in south africa. as i was convinced that the idea was both practical and much needed i communicated full particulars to the war office. here is the letter i had in reply. war office, _feb. 16, 1900_. sir,-- with reference to your letter concerning an appliance for adapting rifles to high angle fire i am directed by the secretary of state for war to inform you that he will not trouble you in the matter. i am, sir, your obedient servant, (signature illegible), director general of ordnance. thus, whether my invention was nonsense or whether it was, as i believe, radical and epoch-making, i was given no chance to explain or to illustrate it. as i remarked in “the times:” “no wonder that we find the latest inventions in the hands of our enemies rather than ourselves if those who try to improve our weapons meet with such encouragement as i have done.” our traditions were carried on in the great war, for pomeroy, the inventor of the inflammable bullet which brought down the zeppelins, was about to return to new zealand in despair, and it was, as i am assured, private and not official bullets which first showed how valuable was his discovery and forced a belated acceptance by the war office. at last our time drew near. my wife had gone to naples, where it was hoped that the warmer climate would complete her cure. my affairs were all settled up. i was to go as an unpaid man, and i contributed my butler cleeve, a good intelligent man for the general use, paying him myself. in this way i retained my independence and could return when i felt that the time had come--which, as events turned out, proved to be very valuable to me. we were reviewed by the old duke of cambridge in some drill-hall in london. there befell me on this occasion one of those quaint happenings which seem to me to have been more common in my life than in that of most other men. we were drawn up in our new khaki uniforms, and wearing our tropical helmets, for the royal duke’s inspection. if we had been asked to form fours we should have broken down completely, but luckily we were placed in double line and so we remained. i was standing in front on the right flank. with my eyes fixed rigidly before me i was still able out of the corner of them to be aware that the old duke, with his suite, was coming across to begin at my end. presently he halted in front of me, and stood motionless. i remained quite rigid, looking past him. he continued to stand, so near me that i could hear and almost feel his puffy breath. “what on earth!” i wondered, but i gave no sign. at last he spoke. “what is this?” he asked. then louder, “what is this?” and finally, in a sort of ecstasy, “what _is_ it?” i never moved an eyelash, but one of a group of journalists upon my right went into hysterical but subdued laughter. there was whispering among the suite, something was explained, and the funny old man passed on. but did ever lever in his maddest moment represent that his hero on the first day of wearing uniform should have such an experience with the ex-commander-in-chief of the british army and the uncle of the queen? it seems that what was worrying the dear old gentleman--he was about eighty at the time--was that my tunic buttons had no mark upon them, a thing which he had never seen in her majesty’s army. even a crown or a star would do, but no mark at all completely upset him, for he was a great stickler for correct military clothing. so, of course, was king edward. a friend of mine at a ball in india (royalty being present) was swooped down upon by a very agitated aide-de-camp who began: “his royal highness desires me to say ...” and went on to point out some defect in his dress kit. my friend answered: “i will mention the matter to my tailor,” which was, i think, an admirable way of quietly putting the matter into its true perspective. on this occasion we officers all filed up to be presented and the old duke made amends by blurting out some very kindly things, for it seems that he greatly approved of my wooden soldier attitude, in spite of my reprehensible buttons. he had a day of agitations, for on the top of the buttons one of the curtains of the hotel took fire during our luncheon at claridge’s, and there was great excitement for a few moments. he made, i remember, an extremely indiscreet speech in which he said: “they turned me off because they said i was too old, but old as i am i wouldn’t have been such a fool as to----” and then he strung off a number of things which lord wolseley, his successor, was supposed to have done. the press was merciful and did not report. we sailed on february 28, 1900, from tilbury, in the chartered transport _oriental_, carrying with us a mixed lot of drafts, and picking up the royal scots militia at queenstown, where a noisy irishwoman threw a white towel on board, crying, “you may be afther finding it useful.” the scots were a rather rough crowd with a number of territorial magnates, lord henry scott, lord tewkesbury, lord newport, lord brackley and others among their officers. colonel garstin of the middlesex was in general command of the whole of us. the monotony of the three weeks’ voyage was broken only by a cricket match at the cape de verdes, by a lecture on the war which i delivered on deck under a tropical moon to all hands, and to an enteric inoculation, which was voluntary but should have been compulsory, for even as it was it saved many lives, and i am not sure that my own was not among them. the great war has shown for ever how effective this treatment is. we lost more from enteric than from the bullet in south africa, and it is sad to think that nearly all could have been saved had almroth wright’s discovery been properly appreciated. his brother was on board, i remember--an officer of sappers--and took the virus particularly badly, though all of us were quite bad enough, for the right dose had not yet been accurately determined. on the evening of march 21 we reached capetown and found the bay full of shipping. there were fifty large steamers at anchor--mostly empty. some of us had a run ashore, but we had some trouble getting on board again, for there was a big swell and the little tug dare not come quite alongside. we had to jump therefore from the paddle-box as the roll favoured us, landing on a hanging ladder, where a quartermaster seized us. to some people such a feat is easy, while others evidently regarded it with horror, and i wondered that we escaped from having some tragedy. the only real mishap was a strange one. a row of soldier faces was looking down on us over the bulwarks, when i saw the grin upon one of them change to a look of horrible agony and he gave a wild scream. he still remained standing, but several men ran towards him, and then he disappeared. only afterwards did i learn that a huge iron bar had in some way fallen upon his foot, pinning him to the place. he fainted as they disengaged him, and was carried below with his bones crushed. i spent next day ashore, with the mount nelson hotel as my head-quarters. it was full of a strange medley of wounded officers, adventuresses and cosmopolitans. kitchener came down and cleared it out shortly afterwards, for the syrens were interfering with his fighting men. the general war news was very good. paardeburg had been fought, lord roberts had made his way to bloemfontein and kimberley had been relieved by french, whose immediate return to head off cronje was one of the inspired incidents of the war. it was a consolation to find that boers really could be captured in large numbers, for their long run of successes while the conditions were in their favour was getting badly upon the public nerves and a legendary sort of atmosphere was beginning to build up around them. some money had been given me for charitable purposes when i was in london, so i went down to the camp of the boer prisoners to see if i could spend some of it. it was a racecourse, pent in with barbed wire, and they were certainly a shaggy, dirty, unkempt crowd but with the bearing of free men. there were a few cruel or brutal faces, some of them half caste, but most were good honest fellows and the general effect was formidable. there were some who were maned like lions. i afterwards went into the tents of the sick boers. several were sitting sullenly round and one was raving in delirium, saying something in his frenzy which set all the others laughing in a mirthless way. one man sat in a corner with a proud dark face and brooding eagle eyes. he bowed with grave courtesy when i put down some money for cigarettes. a huguenot, or i am mistaken. we had been waiting for orders and now we suddenly left capetown on march 26, reaching east london on the 28th. there we disembarked, and i was surprised to find leo trevor, of amateur theatrical fame, acting as transport officer. in spite of his efforts (i hope it was not through them) our hospital stuff was divided between two trains, and when we reached bloemfontein after days of travel we found that the other half had wandered off and was engulfed in the general chaos. there were nights of that journey which i shall never forget--the great train roaring through the darkness, the fires beside the line, the dark groups silhouetted against the flames, the shouts of “who are you?” and the crash of voices as our mates cried back, “the camerons,” for this famous regiment was our companion. wonderful is the atmosphere of war. when the millennium comes the world will gain much, but it will lose its greatest thrill. it is a strange wild place, the veldt, with its vast green plains and peculiar flat-topped hills, relics of some extraordinary geological episode. it is poor pasture--a sheep to two acres--so it must always be sparsely inhabited. little white farms, each with its eucalyptus grove and its dam, were scattered over it. when we crossed the free state border by a makeshift bridge, beside the ruins of the old one, we noticed that many of these little houses were flying the white flag. every one seemed very good-humoured, burghers and soldiers alike, but the guerilla war afterwards altered all that. it was april 2, and 5 a.m. when we at last reached the capital of the free state, and were dumped down outside the town in a great green expanse covered with all sorts of encampments and animals. there was said to be a large force of boers close to the town, and they had cut up one of our columns a few days before at sanna’s post. some troops were moving out, so i, with gwynne whom i had known in egypt, and that great sportsman, claude de crespigny, set forth to see what we could, an artilleryman lending me his led horse. there was nothing doing, however, for it was brother boer’s way never to come when you wanted him and always when you didn’t. save for good company, i got nothing out of a long hot day. good company is always one of the solaces of a campaign. i ran across many old friends, some soldiers, some medicos, some journalists. knight of the “falcon” had, alas, been hit in an early battle and was in hospital. julian ralph, a veteran american correspondent, bennett burleigh the rugged old war horse, queer little melton prior who looked like the prim headmaster of a conventional school, dark-eyed donohue of the “chronicle,” paterson the australian, of snowy river fame, they were a wonderful set of men. i had little time to enjoy their society, however, for among the miles of loaded trucks which lay at the endless sidings i had to my great joy discovered the missing half of our equipment and guided a fatigue party down to it. all day we laboured and before evening our beds were up and our hospital ready for duty. two days later wagons of sick and wounded began to disgorge at our doors and the real work had begun. [illustration: staff of the langman hospital, south africa, 1900.] we had been given the cricket field as our camp and the fine pavilion as our chief ward. others were soon erected, for we had plenty of tents--one each for our own use and a marquee for the mess. we were ready for any moderate strain, but that which was put upon us was altogether beyond our strength and for a month we had a rather awful time. the first intimation of trouble came to me in a simple and dramatic way. we had a bath in the pavilion and i had gone up to it and turned the tap, but not a drop of water appeared, though it had been running freely the night before. this small incident was the first intimation that the boers had cut the water supply of the town, which caused us to fall back upon the old wells, which in turn gave rise to an outbreak of enteric which cost us 5,000 lives. the one great blot in lord roberts’ otherwise splendid handling of the campaign was, in my opinion, that he did not buzz out at once with every man he could raise, and relieve the water works, which were only 20 miles away. instead of this he waited for his army to recuperate, and so exposed them to the epidemic. however, it is always easy to be wise after the event. the outbreak was a terrible one. it was softened down for public consumption and the press messages were heavily censored, but we lived in the midst of death--and death in its vilest, filthiest form. our accommodation was for fifty patients, but 120 were precipitated upon us, and the floor was littered between the beds with sick and often dying men. our linen and utensils were never calculated for such a number, and as the nature of the disease causes constant pollution, and this pollution of the most dangerous character and with the vilest effluvia, one can imagine how dreadful was the situation. the worst surgical ward after a battle would be a clean place compared to that pavilion. at one end was a stage with the scene set for “h.m.s. pinafore.” this was turned into latrines for those who could stagger so far. the rest did the best they could, and we did the best we could in turn. but a verestschagin would have found a subject in that awful ward, with the rows of emaciated men, and the silly childish stage looking down upon it all. in the very worst of it two nursing sisters appeared among us, and never shall i forget what angels of light they appeared, or how they nursed those poor boys, swaddling them like babies and meeting every want with gentle courage. thank god, they both came through safe. four weeks may seem a short time in comfort, but it is a very long one under conditions such as those, amid horrible sights and sounds and smells, while a haze of flies spread over everything, covering your food and trying to force themselves into your mouth--every one of them a focus of disease. it was bad enough when we had a full staff, but soon the men began to wilt under the strain. they were nearly all from the lancashire cotton mills, little, ill-nourished fellows but with a great spirit. of the fifteen twelve contracted the disease and added to the labours of the survivors. three died. fortunately we of the staff were able to keep going, and we were reinforced by a dr. schwartz of capetown. the pressure was great, but we were helped by the thought that the greater the work the more we proved the necessity of our presence in africa. above all, our labours were lightened by the splendid stuff that we had for patients. it was really glorious to see the steady patience with which they bore their sufferings. the british soldier may grouse in days of peace, but i never heard a murmur when he was faced with this loathsome death. our hospital was no worse off than the others, and as there were many of them the general condition of the town was very bad. coffins were out of the question, and the men were lowered in their brown blankets into shallow graves at the average rate of sixty a day. a sickening smell came from the stricken town. once when i had ridden out to get an hour or two of change, and was at least six miles from the town the wind changed and the smell was all around me. you could smell bloemfontein long before you could see it. even now if i felt that low deathly smell, compounded of disease and disinfectants, my heart would sink within me. at last there came the turn. the army had moved on. hospitals up the line absorbed some of the cases. above all the water works had been retaken, and with hardly any resistance. i went out with the force which was to retake it, and slept for the night in a thin coat under a wagon, an experience which left me colder than i can ever remember being in my life--a cold which was not only on the surface, but like some solid thing within you. next morning there was every prospect of a battle, for we had been shelled the night before and it looked as if the position would be held, so ian hamilton, who commanded, made a careful advance. however, there was no resistance, and save for some figures watching us from distant hills there was no sign of the enemy. he had slipped away in the night. in the advance we passed over the drift at sanna’s post where the disaster had occurred some weeks before. the poor artillery horses were still lying in heaps where they had been shot down, and the place was covered with every kind of litter--putties, cholera belts, haversacks, and broken helmets. there were great numbers of boer cartridge papers which were all marked “split bullets. manufactured for the use of the british government, london.” what the meaning of this was, or where they came from, i cannot imagine, for certainly our fellows had always the solid lee-metford bullet, as i can swear after inspecting many a belt. it sounded like some ingenious trick to excuse atrocities, and yet on the whole the boer was a fair and good-humoured fighter until near the close of the war. the move of hamilton’s was really the beginning of the great advance, and having cleared the water works he turned north and became the right wing of the army. on his left was tucker’s 7th division, then kelly kenny’s 6th division, pole-carew’s 1st division, including the guards, and finally a great horde of mounted infantry, including the yeomanry, the colonial and the irregular corps. this was the great line which set forth early in may to sweep up from bloemfontein to pretoria. things had become more quiet at the hospital and presently archie langman and i found a chance to get away and to join the army at the first stage of its advance. i wrote our experience out while it was still fresh in my mind, and the reader will forgive me if i reproduce some of this, as it is likely to be more vivid and more detailed than the blurred impression now left in my memory after more than twenty years. chapter xvii days with the army pole-carew--tucker--snipers--the looted farm--taking of brandfort--artillery engagement--advance of the guards-- the wounded scout--the dead australian--return. stand in the pass at karee, and look north in the clear fresh morning air! before you lies a great plain, dull green, with white farmhouses scattered here and there. one great donga slashes it across. distant hills bound it on all sides, and at the base of those in front, dimly seen, are a line of houses and a steeple. this is brandfort, ten miles off, and we are advancing to attack it. the troops are moving forward, line after line of red faces and khaki, with rumbling columns of guns. two men sit their horses beside us on a knoll, and stare with their glasses at the distant houses. gallant figures both of them; the one spruce, debonnaire, well-groomed, with laughing eyes and upward-curved moustache, a suggestion of schoolboy mischief about his handsome face; the other, grim, fierce, all nose and eyebrow, white scales of sun-dried skin hanging from his brick-red face. the first is pole-carew, general of division; the second is brigadier stephenson. we are finding our men, and these are among them. here is another man worth noting. you could not help noting him if you tried. a burly, broad-shouldered man, with full, square, black beard over his chest, his arm in a sling, his bearing a medieval knight-errant. it is crabbe, of the grenadier guards. he reins his horse for an instant while his guardsmen stream past him. “i’ve had my share--four bullets already. hope i won’t get another to-day.” “you should be in hospital.” “ah, there i must venture to disagree with you.” he rides on with his men. look at the young officers of the guards, the dandies of mayfair. no carpet soldiers, these, but men who have spent six months upon the veldt, and fought from belmont to bloemfontein. their walk is dainty, their putties are well rolled--there is still the suggestion of the west end. if you look with your glasses on the left you may see movement on the farthest skyline. that is hutton’s mounted infantry, some thousands of them, to turn the flank of any resistance. as far as you can see to the right is tucker’s division. beyond that again are ian hamilton’s mounted infantry and french’s cavalry. the whole front is a good thirty miles, and 35,000 men go to the making of it. now we advance over the great plain, the infantry in extended order, a single company covering half a mile. look at the scouts and the flankers--we should not have advanced like that six months ago. it is not our additional numbers so much as our new warcraft which makes us formidable. the big donga is only 2,000 yards off now, so we halt and have a good look at it. guns are unlimbered--just as well to be ready. pole-carew rides up like a schoolboy on a holiday. “who’s seen old tucker?” i hear him say, with his glasses to his eyes. he had sent a message to the scouts. “there now, look at that aide of mine. he has galloped along the donga to see if any boers are in it. what right had he to do that? when i ask him he will say that he thought i was there.... halloa, you, sir, why don’t you come back straight?” “i did, sir.” “you didn’t. you rode along that donga.” “i thought you were there, sir.” “don’t add lying to your other vices.” the aide came grinning back. “i was fired at, but i dare not tell the old man.” rap! rap! rap! rifles in front. every one pricks up his ears. is it the transient sniper or the first shot of a battle? the shots come from the farmhouse yonder. the 83rd field battery begin to fidget about their guns. the officer walks up and down and stares at the farmhouse. from either side two men pull out lines of string and give long, monotonous cries. they are the range-finders. a gunner on the limber is deep in a sixpenny magazine, absorbed, his chin on his hand. “our scouts are past the house,” says an officer. “that’s all right,” says the major. the battery limbers up and the whole force advances to the farmhouse. off-saddle and a halt for luncheon. halloa! here are new and sinister developments. a tommy drives a smart buggy and pair out of the yard, looted for the use of the army. the farm is prize of war, for have they not fired at our troops? they could not help the firing, poor souls, but still this sniping must be discouraged. we are taking off our gloves at last over this war. but the details are not pretty. a frightened girl runs out. “is it right that they kill fowls?” alas! the question is hardly worth debating, for the fowls are dead. erect and indignant, the girl drives in her three young turkeys. men stare at her curiously, but she and her birds are not molested. here is something worse. a fat white pig all smothered in blood runs past. a soldier meets it, his bayonet at the charge. he lunges and lunges again, and the pig screams horribly. i had rather see a man killed. some are up in the loft throwing down the forage. others root up the vegetables. one drinks milk out of a strange vessel, amid the laughter of his comrades. it is a grotesque and medieval scene. the general rides up, but he has no consolation for the women. “the farm has brought it upon itself.” he rides away again. a parson rides up. “i can’t imagine why they don’t burn it,” says he. a little dutch boy stares with large, wondering grey eyes. he will tell all this to his grandchildren when we are in our graves. “war is a terrible thing,” says the mother, in dutch. the tommies, with curious eyes, cluster round the doors and windows, staring in at the family. there is no individual rudeness. one kaffir enters the room. “a kaffir!” cries the girl, with blazing eyes. “yes, a kaffir,” says he defiantly--but he left. “they won’t burn the house, will they?” cries the mother. “no, no,” we answer; “they will not burn the house.” we advance again after lunch, the houses and steeple much nearer. boom! boom! boom! cannon at last! but it is far away, over at tucker’s side. there are little white puffs on the distant green hills. those are shells bursting. if you look through your glasses you will see--eight miles off--a british battery in action. sometimes a cloud of dust rises over it. that is a boer shell which has knocked up the dust. no boers can be seen from here. boom! boom! boom! it becomes monotonous. “old tucker is getting it hot!” bother old tucker, let us push on to brandfort. on again over the great plain, the firing dying away on the right. we have had a gun knocked off its wheels and twelve men hit over there. but now hutton’s turning movement is complete, and they close in on the left of brandfort. a pom-pom quacks like some horrid bird among the hills. our horse artillery are banging away. white spurts of shrapnel rise along the ridge. the leading infantry bend their backs and quicken their pace. we gallop to the front, but the resistance has collapsed. the mounted men are riding forward and the guns are silent. long, sunlit hills stretch peacefully before us. i ride through the infantry again. “the bloody blister on my toe has bust.” “this blasted water-bottle!” every second man has a pipe between his parched lips. the town is to the right, and two miles of plain intervene. on the plain a horseman is rounding up some mares and foals. i recognize him as i pass--burdett-coutts--a well-known figure in society. mr. maxwell of the “morning post” suggests that we ride to the town and chance it. “our men are sure to be there.” no sign of them across the plain, but we will try. he outrides me, but courteously waits, and we enter the town together. yes, it’s all right; there’s a rimington scout in the main street--a group of them, in fact. a young boer, new caught, stands among the horsemen. he is discomposed--not much. a strong, rather coarse face; well-dressed; might appear, as he stands, in an english hunting-field as a young yeoman farmer. “comes of being fond of the ladies,” said the australian sergeant. “wanted to get her out of the town,” said the boer. another was brought up. “i’d have got off in a minute,” says he. “you’d have got off as it was if you had the pluck of a louse,” says his captor. the conversation languished after that. in came the staff, galloping grandly. the town is ours. a red-headed irish-american is taken on the kopje. “what the hell is that to you?” he says to every question. he is haled away to gaol--a foul-mouthed blackguard. we find the landlady of our small hotel in tears--her husband in gaol, because a rifle has been found. we try to get him out, and succeed. he charges us 4_s._ for half a bottle of beer, and we wonder whether we cannot get him back into gaol again. “the house is not my own. i find great burly men everywhere,” he cries, with tears in his eyes. his bar is fitted with pornographic pictures to amuse our simple farmer friends--not the first or the second sign which i have seen that pastoral life and a puritan creed do not mean a high public morality. we sit on the stoep and smoke in the moonlight. there comes a drunken inhabitant down the main street. a dingy tommy stands on guard in front. “halt! who goes there?” “a friend.” “give the countersign!” “i’m a free-born englishman!” “give the countersign!” “i’m a freeborn----” with a rattle the sentry’s rifle came to his shoulder and the moon glinted on his bayonet. “hi, stop!” cries a senior correspondent. “you juggins, you’ll be shot! don’t fire, sentry!” tommy raised his rifle reluctantly and advanced to the man. “what shall i do with him, sir?” he asked the correspondent. “oh, what you like!” he vanished out of history. i talk politics with free staters. the best opening is to begin, in an inquiring tone, “why did you people declare war upon us?” they have got into such an injured-innocence state that it comes quite as a shock to them when they are reminded that they were the attackers. by this socratic method one attains some interesting results. it is evident that they all thought they could win easily, and that they are very bitter now against the transvaal. they are mortally sick of the war; but, for that matter, so are most of the british officers. it has seemed to me sometimes that it would be more judicious, and even more honourable, if some of the latter were less open about the extent to which they are “fed-up.” it cannot be inspiriting for their men. at the same time there would be a mutiny in the army if any conditions short of absolute surrender were accepted--and in spite of their talk, if a free pass were given to-day, i am convinced that very few officers would return until the job was done. our railway engineers are great. the train was in brandfort next day, in spite of broken bridges, smashed culverts, twisted metals, every sort of wrecking. so now we are ready for another twenty miles pretoriawards. the vet river is our goal this time, and off we go with the early morning. another great green plain, with dotted farms and the huge khaki column slowly spreading across it. the day was hot, and ten miles out the guards had about enough. stragglers lay thick among the grass, but the companies kept their double line formation, and plodded steadily along. ten miles sounds very little, but try it in the dust of a column on a hot day, with a rifle over your shoulder, a 100 rounds of ammunition, a blanket, a canteen, an empty water-bottle, and a dry tongue. a grey-bearded padre limped bravely beside his men. “no, no,” says he, when offered my horse. “i must not spoil my record.” the men are silent on the march; no band, no singing. grim and sullen, the column flows across the veldt. officers and men are short in their tempers. “why don’t you,” etc., etc., bleats a subaltern. “because i never can hear what you say,” says the corporal. they halt for a midday rest, and it seems to me, as i move among them, that there is too much nagging on the part of the officers. we have paid too much attention to the german military methods. our true model should have been the american, for it is what was evolved by the anglo-celtic race in the greatest experience of war which the anglo-celtic race has ever had. on we go again over that great plain. is there anything waiting for us down yonder where the low kopjes lie? the boers have always held rivers. they held the modder. they held the tugela. will they hold the vet? halloa, what’s this? a startled man in a night-cap on a dapple-grey horse. he gesticulates. “fifty of them--hot corner--lost my helmet.” we catch bits of his talk. but what’s that on the dapple-grey’s side? the horse is shot through the body. he grazes quietly with black streaks running down the reeking hair. “a west australian, sir. they shot turble bad, for we were within fifty yards before they loosed off.” “which kopje?” “that one over yonder.” we ride forward, and pass through the open ranks of the guards’ skirmishers. behind us the two huge naval guns are coming majestically up, drawn by their thirty oxen, like great hock-bottles on wheels. in front a battery has unlimbered. we ride up to the side of it. away in front lies a small, slate-roofed farm beside the kopje. the mounted infantry have coalesced into one body and are moving towards us. “here’s the circus. there is going to be a battle,” was an infantry phrase in the american war. our circus was coming in, and perhaps the other would follow. the battery (84th r.f.a.) settles down to its work. bang! i saw the shell burst on a hillside far away. “3,500,” says somebody. bang! “3,250,” says the voice. bang! “3,300.” a puff shoots up from the distant grey roof as if their chimney were on fire. “got him that time!” the game seems to us rather one-sided, but who is that shooting in the distance? “wheeeeee”--what a hungry whine, and then a dull muffled “ooof!” up goes half a cartload of earth about one hundred yards ahead of the battery. the gunners take as much notice as if it were a potato. “wheeeeeee--ooof!” fifty yards in front this time. “bang! bang!” go the crisp english guns. “wheeeeee--ooof!” fifty yards behind the battery. they’ll get it next time as sure as fate. gunners go on unconcernedly. “wheeeeee--ooof!” right between the guns, by george! two guns invisible for the dust. good heavens, how many of our gunners are left? dust settles, and they are all bending and straining and pulling the same as ever. another shell and another, and then a variety, for there comes a shell which breaks high up in the air--wheeeeee--tang--with a musical, resonant note, like the snapping of a huge banjo-string, and a quarter of an acre of ground spurted into little dust-clouds under the shrapnel. the gunners take no interest in it. percussion or shrapnel, fire what you will, you must knock the gun off its wheels or the man off his pins before you settle the r.f.a. but every shell is bursting true, and it is mere luck that half the battery are not down. once only did i see a man throw back his head a few inches as a shell burst before him. the others might have been parts of an automatic machine. but the officer decided to shift the guns--and they are shifted. they trot away for half a mile to the right and come into action again. the lonely hero is the man to be admired. it is easy to be collectively brave. a man with any sense of proportion feels himself to be such a mite in the presence of the making of history that his own individual welfare seems for the moment too insignificant to think of. the unit is lost in the mass. but now we find ourselves alone on the plain with the battery away to the right. the nerves of the novice are strung up by the sound of the shells, but there is something of exhilaration in the feeling also. there is a fence about 200 yards off, and to this we tether our horses, and we walk up and down trying with our glasses to spot where the boer guns are. we have suspicions, but nothing more. our gunners may know, but we do not feel confident about it. surely the stealthy lurking gun is worth six guns which stand bravely forth in the open. these farmers have taught our riflemen their business, and they bid fair to alter the artillery systems of the world as well. our guns and theirs are like a fight between a blind man and one who can see. an artillery colonel is wandering loose, and we talk. he has no job of his own, so he comes, like the coachman on a holiday, to watch some other man’s guns at work. a shell falls some distance short of us. “the next one,” says the colonel, “will go over our heads. come and stand over here.” i do so, with many mental reservations. wheeeeeeee---- “here it comes!” says the colonel. “here i go!” think i. it burst on our level, but 40 yards to the right. i secure a piece as a souvenir. “shall we wait for another?” i began to be sorry that i met the colonel. but a new sensation breaks upon us. looking back we see that two monster naval guns are coming into action not fifty yards from our tethered horses, which stand in a dead line before their huge muzzles. we only just got them clear in time. bang! the father of all the bangs this time, and a pillar of white smoke with a black heart to it on the farther hill. i can see some riders like ants, going across it--boers on the trek. our men take the huge brass cartridge-case out of the gun. “can i have that?” “certainly,” says the lieutenant. i tie it on to my saddle, and feel apologetic towards my long-suffering horse. the great gun roars and roars and the malignant spouts of smoke rise on the farthest hill. a line of infantry in very open order comes past the great guns, and i advance a little way with them. they are scots guards. the first line goes forward, the second is halted and lying down. “that’s right! show where you are!” cries the second line, derisively. i seem to have missed the point, but the young officer in the first line is very angry. “hold your tongues!” he shouts, with his red face looking over his shoulder. “too many orders. no one gives orders but me.” his men lie down. the sun is sinking low, and it is evident that the contemplated infantry assault will not come off. one of the great naval shells passes high over our heads. it is the sound of a distant train in a tunnel. a man canters past with a stretcher over his shoulder. his bay horse lollops along, but the stretcher makes him look very top-heavy. he passes the guns and the infantry, and rides on along the edge of a maize field. he is half a mile out now, heading for the kopje. every instant i expect to see him drop from his horse. then he vanishes in a dip of the ground. after a time the stretcher appears again. this time two men are carrying it, and the horseman rides beside. i have bandages in my pocket, so i ride forward also. “has a surgeon seen him?” “no, sir.” they lay the man down. there is a handkerchief over his face. “where is it?” “his stomach and his arm.” i pull up his shirt, and there is the mauser bullet lying obvious under the skin. it has gone round instead of penetrating. a slit with a pen-knife would extract it, but that had better be left for chloroform and the field hospital. nice clean wound in the arm. “you will do very well. what is your name?” “private smith, sir. new zealander.” i mention my name and the langman hospital at bloemfontein. “i’ve read your books,” says he, and is carried onwards. there has been a lull in the firing and the sun is very low. then after a long interval comes a last boer shell. it is an obvious insult, aimed at nothing, a derisive good-night and good-bye. the two naval guns put up their long necks and both roared together. it was the last word of the empire--the mighty angry voice calling over the veldt. the red rim had sunk and all was purple and crimson, with the white moon high in the west. what had happened? who had won? were other columns engaged? no one knew anything or seemed to care. but late at night as i lay under the stars i saw on the left front signal flashes from over the river, and i knew that hutton was there. so it proved, for in the morning it was over the camp in an instant that the enemy had gone. but the troops were early afoot. long before dawn came the weird, muffled tapping of the drums and the crackling of sticks as the camp-kettles were heated for breakfast. then with the first light we saw a strange sight. a monstrous blister was rising slowly from the veldt. it was the balloon being inflated--our answer to the lurking guns. we would throw away no chances now, but play every card in our hand--another lesson which the war has driven into our proud hearts. the army moved on, with the absurd windbag flapping over the heads of the column. we climbed the kopjes where the enemy had crouched, and saw the litter of empty mauser cases and the sangars so cunningly built. among the stones lay a packet of the venomous-looking green cartridges still unfired. they talk of poison, but i doubt it. verdigris would be an antiseptic rather than a poison in a wound. it is more likely that it is some decomposition of the wax in which the bullets are dipped. brother boer is not a bushman after all. he is a tough, stubborn fighter, who plays a close game, but does not cheat. we say good-bye to the army, for our duty lies behind us and theirs in front. for them the bullets, for us the microbes, and both for the honour of the flag. scattered trails of wagons, ambulance carts, private buggies, impedimenta of all kinds, radiate out from the army. it is a bad drift, and it will be nightfall before they are all over. we pass the last of them, and it seems strange to emerge from that great concourse and see the twenty miles of broad, lonely plain which lies between us and brandfort. we shall look rather foolish if any boer horsemen are hanging about the skirts of the army. we passed the battlefield of last night, and stopped to examine the holes made by the shells. three had fallen within ten yards, but the ant-heaps round had not been struck, showing how harmless the most severe shell fire must be to prostrate infantry. from the marks in the clay the shells were large ones--forty-pounders, in all probability. in a little heap lay the complete kit of a guardsman--his canteen, water-bottle, cup, even his putties. he had stripped for action with a vengeance. poor devil, how uncomfortable he must be to-day! a kaffir on horseback is rounding up horses on the plain. he gallops towards us--a picturesque, black figure on his shaggy basuto mount. he waves his hand excitedly towards the east. “englishman there--on veldt--hurt--dutchman shoot him.” he delivers his message clearly enough. “is he alive?” he nods. “when did you see him?” he points to the sun and then farther east. about two hours ago apparently. “can you take us there?” we buy him for 2_s._, and all canter off together. our road is through maize fields and then out on to the veldt. by jove, what’s that? there _is_ a single black motionless figure in the middle of that clearing. we gallop up and spring from our horses. a short muscular, dark man is lying there with a yellow, waxen face, and a blood-clot over his mouth. a handsome man, black-haired, black moustached, his expression serene--no. 410 new south wales mounted infantry--shot, overlooked and abandoned. there are evident signs that he was not alive when the kaffir saw him. rifle and horse are gone. his watch lies in front of him, dial upwards, run down at one in the morning. poor chap, he had counted the hours until he could see them no longer. we examine him for injuries. obviously he had bled to death. there is a horrible wound in his stomach. his arm is shot through. beside him lies his water-bottle--a little water still in it, so he was not tortured by thirst. and there is a singular point. on the water-bottle is balanced a red chess pawn. has he died playing with it? it looks like it. where are the other chessmen? we find them in a haversack out of his reach. a singular trooper this, who carries chessmen on a campaign. or is it loot from a farmhouse? i shrewdly suspect it. we collect the poor little effects of no. 410--a bandolier, a stylographic pen, a silk handkerchief, a clasp-knife, a waterbury watch, £2 6_s._ 6_d._ in a frayed purse. then we lift him, our hands sticky with his blood, and get him over my saddle--horrible to see how the flies swarm instantly on to the saddle-flaps. his head hangs down on one side and his heels on the other. we lead the horse, and when from time to time he gives a horrid dive we clutch at his ankles. thank heaven, he never fell. it is two miles to the road, and there we lay our burden under a telegraph post. a convoy is coming up, and we can ask them to give him a decent burial. no. 410 holds one rigid arm and clenched fist in the air. we lower it, but up it springs menacing, aggressive. i put his mantle over him; but still, as we look back, we see the projection of that raised arm. so he met his end--somebody’s boy. fair fight, open air, and a great cause--i know no better death. a long, long ride on tired horses over an endless plain. here and there mounted kaffirs circle and swoop. i have an idea that a few mounted police might be well employed in our rear. how do we know what these kaffirs may do among lonely farms held by women and children? very certain i am that it is not their own horses which they are rounding up so eagerly. ten miles have passed, and we leave the track to water our horses at the dam. a black mare hard-by is rolling and kicking. curious that she should be so playful. we look again, and she lies very quiet. one more has gone to poison the air of the veldt. we sit by the dam and smoke. down the track there comes a colonial corps of cavalry--a famous corps, as we see when our glasses show us the colour of the cockades. good heavens, will we never have sense beaten into us? how many disasters and humiliations must we endure before we learn how to soldier? the regiment passes without a vanguard, without scouts, without flankers, in an enemy’s country intersected by dongas. oh, for a napoleon who might meet such a regiment, tear the epaulettes of the colonel from his shoulders, stellenbosch him instantly without appeal or argument. only such a man with such powers can ever thoroughly reorganize our army. another six miles over the great plain. here is a small convoy, with an escort of militia, only a mile or two out from brandfort. they are heading wrong, so we set them right. the captain in charge is excited. “there are boers on that hill!” the hill is only half a mile or so away on our left; so we find the subject interesting. “kaffirs!” we suggest. “no, no, mounted men with bandoliers and rifles. why, there they are now.” we see moving figures, but again suggest kaffirs. it ends by our both departing unconvinced. we thought the young officer jumpy over his first convoy, but we owe him an apology, for next morning we learned that the mounted infantry had been out all night chasing the very men whom we had seen. it is likely that the accidental presence of the convoy saved us from a somewhat longer journey than we had intended. a day at brandfort, a night in an open truck, and we were back at the café enterique, boulevard des microbes, which is our town address. chapter xviii final experiences in south africa military jealousies--football--cracked ribs--a mutiny--de wet--a historian under difficulties--pretoria--lord roberts--with the boers--memorable operation--altercation. military men are more full of jealousies and more prone to divide into cliques than any set of men whom i have met. south africa was rent with their quarrels, and one heard on every side of how general this was daggers drawn with general that. but the greatest cleavage of all was between the roberts men and the buller men. the former were certainly very bitter against the reliever of ladysmith, and the comments about the difference between his evening telegrams and those of next morning were painful to hear. i had, however, less sympathy, as buller was a coarse-fibred man, though a brave soldier. several authentic anecdotes pointed to this want of perception. when, for example, he entered ladysmith the defenders saved up a few cakes and other luxuries for the day of their release. these they laid before buller at the welcoming lunch. “i thought you were a starving city,” said he, looking round at them. this story i heard from several men who claimed to speak with knowledge as well as bitterness. it would have been sad had buller’s long meritorious, hard-fighting career gone down in clouds, but it cannot be denied that in the french, or i think in any other service, he could not have survived colenso. the strange speech which he made at a london luncheon after the war proved, i think, that his mind had lost something of its grip of realities. roberts, as usual, played the noblest possible part in this unhappy controversy. “i shall handle buller with all possible tenderness,” he said to one of his staff, and he lived up to his words. i found the hospital on my return to be in a very improved condition. i fell ill myself, however, though it was not serious enough to incapacitate me. i still think that if i had not been inoculated i should at that time have had enteric, and there was surely something insidious in my system, for it was a good ten years before my digestion had recovered its tone. my condition was not improved by a severe bruising of the ribs caused by a foul in one of the inter-hospital football matches which we had organized in order to take the minds of the men from their incessant work. charles gibbs strapped me up with plaster, as in a corset, but i was getting too old for rough handling which i could have smiled at in my youth. one quaint memory of those days rises before me. there was a sharp quarrel between drury, our military c.o. representing routine discipline, and our cooks and servants representing civilian ideas of liberty. it was mishandled and had reached such a point when i returned from the army that the men were on absolute strike, the work was disorganized and the patients were suffering. drury was breathing fire and fury, which only made the men more obdurate. it really looked as if there might be a considerable scandal, and i felt that it was just such a case as mr. langman would have wished me to handle. i asked leave of major drury, therefore, that i might take the matter up, and he was, i fancy, very glad that i should, for he was at the end of his resources, and a public exposure of a disorganized unit means also a discredited commander. i therefore sat behind the long mess table, and had the six ringleaders before me, all standing in a line with sullen mutiny in their faces. i talked to them gently and quietly, saying that i was in some sense responsible for them, since several of them had been enlisted by me. i sympathized with them in all they had gone through, and said that all our nerves had been a little overstrained, but that duty and discipline must rise above our bodily weakness. no doubt their superiors also had been strained and some allowance must be made on both sides. i then took a graver tone. “this matter is just going forward for court martial and i have intervened at the last instant. you clearly understand your own position. you have disobeyed orders on active service in the presence of the enemy. there is only one punishment possible for such an offence. it is death.” six pairs of eyes stared wildly in front of me. having produced my effect i went into their grievances, promised that they should be considered, and demanded an apology to major drury as the condition for doing anything further. they were six chastened men who filed out of the marquee, the apology was forthcoming, and there were no more troubles in the camp. an anxiety came to us about this time from a very unexpected cause, for archie langman, who had been my good comrade in my visit to the army, went off again, trekking up country with the imperial yeomanry and ran right into the arms of de wet, who had just raided the line and won a small victory at a place called roodeval. the famous guerilla leader was stern but just, and he treated the hospital men with consideration, so that archie returned none the worse for his adventure. but there was a bad day or two for me between our learning of his capture and of his release. the army had got forward with little fighting, and pretoria was in our hands. it seemed to all of us that the campaign was over and that only cleaning-up remained to be done. i began to consider my own return to europe, and there were two potent influences which drew me, apart from the fact that the medical pressure no longer existed. the first was that i had during all this time continued to write the history of the war, drawing my material very often from the eye-witnesses to these events. but there was a good deal which could only be got at the centre, and therefore if my book was to be ready before that of my rivals it was necessary for me to be on the spot. the second was that a political crisis and a general election were coming on, and it was on the cards that i might be a candidate. i could not, however, leave africa until i had seen pretoria, so, with some difficulty, i obtained leave and was off on the much-broken and precarious railway on june 22. that journey was certainly the strangest railway journey of my life. from minute to minute one never knew what would happen. i was in the good company of major hanbury williams, lord milner’s secretary, who allowed me to share his special carriage, and we had with us a little alert man named amery, then unknown to fame, but now deservedly in the seats of the mighty. there were others but i have forgotten them. when the train stopped in the middle of the veldt, which it continually did, one never knew whether it was for five minutes or for five hours, as did actually occur, and as it went on again without warning one had to sit tight. we met a down train with its windows shattered and heard that twenty folk had been injured in a boer ambuscade. every hour we expected to be attacked. once during one of our long halts we saw a horseman come cantering over the great green expanse. we got out to see and interview him. he was a tall, slab-sided fellow, unarmed, but with a rakish debonnaire look to him. he said he was a loyal british farmer, but i had no doubt in my own mind that he was a boer scout who wanted to see what our train was carrying. he sat easy in his saddle for some little time, chatting with us, and then suddenly wheeled his grey horse round and galloped away. some way further down the line we saw a farm burning, and a fringe of our irregulars riding round it. i was told that it was one of de wet’s farms and that it was a punishment for cutting the line. the whole scene might have been in the middle ages--say a company of moss troopers on a raid over the english border. when we came to the place of the roodeval disaster, where our derbyshire militia had been sadly cut up by de wet, the train had to stop, for the line was under repair, and we were able to go over the ground. the place was littered with shells for the heavy guns taken from some looted train. then there were acres covered with charred or partly charred letters, blowing about in the wind, for de wet had burned the mail bags--one of his less sportsmanlike actions. napoleon went one better, however, on a certain occasion when he published an intercepted british mail, which led to a british reprisal of the same sort, not at all conducive to the peace of families. i picked up one letter which fluttered up to me, and i read in rough handwriting, “i hope you have killed all them boers by now,” with many x (kisses) underneath. among other things were some of the band instruments, across which de wet had driven his heavy wagons. it gave me a strange thrill when i looked out early one morning at a deserted platform and saw the word pretoria printed upon a board. here we were at last at the very centre of all things. the transvaal hotel was open and for several days it was my head-quarters while i examined men and things. one of my first tasks was to see lord roberts, who desired to interview me on account of some sensational articles by burdett-coutts which had appeared in the london press upon the state of the hospitals. of course that state had in many cases, possibly in all, been awful, but the reason lay in the terrible and sudden emergency. every one had done his best to meet it and had met it to a surprising degree, but cases of hardship were numerous all the same. this i explained to lord roberts--and also to the royal commission in london. as an unpaid independent volunteer my words may have had more weight than those of some far greater authority who was personally involved. i can see roberts now as he sat behind a small desk in his room. his face looked red and engorged, but that was due no doubt to his life in the sun. he was urbane and alert, reminding me at once of our former meeting in london. his light blue eyes were full of intelligence and kindness, but they had the watery look of age. indeed, i can hardly remember in all military history a case where a man over seventy had been called out from retirement to conduct so arduous a campaign, and it was his conception of the fine flank march to paardeburg which had actually beaten the boers, however long they might keep up appearances of resistance. we had a short vivid talk and i never saw him again until he came to my own house at hindhead to inspect my rifle range in 1902. of lord kitchener i saw nothing at pretoria, but on one occasion a big man on a huge bay horse went past me at a hard gallop on the veldt and as he passed he waved his hand, and i knew it was the famous soldier. he had been under a cloud since paardeburg, and indeed it is hard to see how his tactics can be justified, since he attacked the boers and lost some 2,000 men, when they were headed off and were bound to surrender in any case. there may be reasons unknown to a civilian, but i have heard soldiers speak warmly about it, for some of the attackers were mounted troops who had to gallop to the edge of the donga, and could do nothing when they got there. colonel hannay actually registered some protest before obeying the orders in which he and many of his men met their death. however, it was to kitchener that all men turned now when the organization of the lines of communication was the vital point, and that rather than actual battle was his forte. i have been told by some who have been in action with him that he became nervously restless and impatient in a fight, while roberts, on the other hand, became cooler and more quiet the greater the danger grew. in organization, however, kitchener was inhuman in his cool accuracy. “regret to report great dynamite explosion. forty kaffirs killed,” was the report of one officer. “do you need more dynamite?” was the answering telegram from lord kitchener. there was a bench outside my hotel on which a group of old bearded burghers used to smoke their pipes every day. i went down and sat among them with my boer pipe filled with the best magaliesburg. i said nothing, so soon they began to make advances, speaking excellent english in rough guttural fashion. botha was not far from the town, and it was notorious that spies took him out the news every night. these old fellows were clearly a collecting station, so i thought it would be useful to give them something to ponder. after conversational remarks one of them said: “tell us, mister, when are we to have peace?” they were under the impression that the whole british nation was longing for peace, and it was this which encouraged the resistance. “oh,” said i, “i hope not for a long time yet.” they all looked at each other, and then the spokesman said: “why do you say that, mister?” “well, it’s this way,” said i. “this country, you see, is going to be a british colony. it would be very awkward for us to have a colony which was full of dangerous men. we couldn’t kill them then, could we? they would be fellow-citizens and under the law’s protection, the same as we. our only chance is to kill them now, and that’s what we will do if we have the time.” the old fellows all grunted and puffed furiously at their pipes, but they could find no answer. possibly some version of the matter may have reached the point i was aiming at. our longest excursion from pretoria was to waterval, whither bennett burleigh took me in his cape cart. once we got quite close to a boer patrol, about a dozen horsemen. burleigh could not believe that they were actually the enemy until i pointed out that several of the horses were white, which was hardly ever known in our service. he then examined them with his glass, and found i was right. they were clearly on some quest of their own, for they took no notice of us, though they could easily have cut us off. our drive took us to the great prison camp where so many british and colonial soldiers had a humiliating experience. the prisoners had only got free a week or two before, and the whole place, many acres in size, was covered with every sort of souvenir. i contented myself with a boer carbine which had been broken by a british prisoner, a band triangle, a half-knitted sock, the knitting needles being made from the barbed wire, and a set of leg fetters from the camp gaol. a tunnel had been bored just before the general delivery by some captive hussars. it was a wonderful work, considering that it was done chiefly with spoons, and it had just been finished when relief came. i descended into it, and was photographed by burleigh as i emerged. i daresay many of my friends have copies of it still, with my inscription: “getting out of a hole, like the british empire.” i spent a day in johannesburg, walking its deserted streets and seeing its great mines now dead or at least in suspended animation. i descended one of the deep mines, the robinson, but as the hoisting machinery was out of order, and we had to walk in darkness down hundreds (it seemed thousands) of slippery wooden steps, with buckets, which did the draining, clanking past one’s ear, it was certainly an over-rated amusement. we got the usual tips as to which mines were going to boom--on all of which i acted, and all of which proved to be wrong. on july 4, after an uneventful journey, which proved in itself that our grip was tightening upon the country, i found myself back in the langman hospital again. times were quiet there, though another of our poor orderlies had just died of erysipelas, which had broken out in the wards--not traumatic erysipelas, but a variety which came without apparent cause. i mention the fact because enteric had been so universal that there really seemed no other disease, and this was the only appearance of any other ailment. if the army had all been inoculated, this would, i think, have been absolutely the healthiest war on record. of surgical cases we had few, but i remember one operation which is perhaps rather technical for discussion and yet stands out very clearly in my memory. it was performed upon the dutch military attaché with the boers, who was picked up wounded and paralyzed after some engagement. a shrapnel bullet had broken one of his cervical vertebræ, the bone pressed on the nerves, and they had ceased to function. watson cheyne of london was the operator. he had cut down on the bone with a free incision and was endeavouring with a strong forceps to raise the broken arch of bone, when an amazing thing happened. out of the great crimson cleft there rose a column of clear water 2 feet high, feathering at the top like a little palm tree, which gradually dwindled until it was only a few inches long, and finally disappeared. i had, i confess, no idea what it was, and i think many of the assembled surgeons were as taken aback as i was. the mystery was explained by charles gibbs, my mentor in such matters, who said that the cerebro-spinal fluid, which is usually a mere moistening round the cord, had been greatly stimulated and increased by the pressure of the broken bone. it had finally distended the whole sheath. the forceps had punctured a small hole in the sheath and then the fluid had been pressed through and shot into the air as i had seen it. perhaps the release was too sudden, for the patient died shortly after he was removed from the table. charles gibbs is still in practice, and senior surgeon of charing cross hospital, but he will forgive me if i remind him that his pupil did once score over him. one of my enteric patients was obviously dying and kept murmuring that he would like some solid food. of course the first law in treating enteric is, or was, that diet must be fluid, as the intestine is ulcerated and puncture of it means death by peritonitis. i said to gibbs: “do you consider that this man is sure to die?” “he is certainly as bad as he can be,” said gibbs. “well then,” said i, “i propose to give him a solid meal.” gibbs shook his head and was shocked. “it is a great responsibility you take.” “what’s the odds,” i asked, “if he has to die anyhow?” “well, it’s just the difference whether you kill him or the disease does.” “well, i’ll take the chance,” said i--and i did so. a year or so later i was attending a public meeting at edinburgh when the following letter, which i copy from my book of curiosities, was handed up to me. 128, royal road, kennington park, london, s.e. _october 1, 1900._ sir,-- as one who was under your care at bloemfontein in “langman’s hospital” i hope you will forgive me in taking the liberty of wishing you success at edinburgh. i am actuated in this not only by political principles but by the fact that i (and others) owe my life to your kindness and care. you may not remember me, sir, but i can assure you the remembrance of you is written in my mind and can never be removed. again wishing you success and hoping you will pardon this liberty, i remain, sir, yours obediently, (pte.) m. hanlon, c.i.v. m. hanlon was my enteric patient and he had never looked back from the day he had that square meal. but i don’t say it was an example for the family practitioner to copy. on july 11 i went on board the _briton_ at capetown and we sailed for england once more. i called upon sir alfred milner before i left, and found him a very much older man than when only a few years before i had met him on the eve of his african experience. his hair was grizzled and his shoulders bowed, but his brave heart was as steadfast as ever, nor did it ever fail until his hard and thankless task was done. he made one error, i think, when he desired to keep south africa under martial law when the war was over, but who could have done better, or as well, under the intolerable conditions which he had to face? it was a remarkable passenger list on the _briton_, and a very joyous voyage. the duke of norfolk and his brother lord edward talbot were two of the most cheery people on the ship. it was a weird sight to see the senior baron of england and a lumpy hollander sitting face to face on a spar, and slashing each other with bladders to see which could knock off the other. blood told, if i remember right. then there was sir john willoughby, of jameson raid fame, lady sarah wilson from mafeking, the duke of marlborough, lady arthur grosvenor, the hon. ivor guest and many famous soldiers. especially was i fortunate in my friendship with fletcher robinson and with nevinson, which was cemented by this closer association. only one cloud marred the serenity of that golden voyage. there was a foreign officer on board, whose name i will not mention, who had been with the boers and who talked with great indiscretion as to his experiences and opinions. he stated in my presence that the british had habitually used dum-dum bullets, on which i lost my temper and told him he was a liar. i must say that he behaved very well, for after thinking it over he saw that he was in the wrong and he sent down my friend robinson to my cabin with a query as to whether i would accept an apology. i answered that i would not, since it was the army, and not me, which had been insulted. in an hour robinson reappeared with the following letter, which ended what might have been a serious incident. dear sir,-- allow me to tell you that i regret lively what i said about expanding bullets--which i said but after hear saying evidence i request you to let everybody know that i strongly wish on the contrary that i desire to be on best terms with every englishman and beg you for that to be my interpreter. yours very truly. the first days of august saw me in london once more, and soon all that strange episode--the green expanse of the veldt, the flat-topped hills, the enteric wards--had become the vision of a dream. chapter xix an appeal to the world’s opinion misrepresentation--a sudden resolve--reginald smith--a week’s hard work--“the cause and conduct of the war”--translations--german letter--complete success--surplus. one of the most pleasing and complete episodes in my life was connected with the pamphlet which i wrote upon the methods and objects of our soldiers in south africa. it was an attempt to stem the extraordinary outbreak of defamation which had broken out in every country--or nearly every country, in europe, and which had attained such a height that it really seemed that on this absolutely fictitious basis might be built up a powerful political combination which would involve us in a serious war. i can well remember the inception of my enterprise! the date was january 7, 1902. the day was a tuesday. sir henry thompson was holding that evening one of those charming “octave” dinners at which it was my occasional privilege to attend, and i was going up to town from hindhead to keep the engagement. sitting alone in a carriage i read the foreign correspondence of “the times.” in a single column there were accounts of meetings in all parts of europe--notably one of some hundreds of rhineland clergymen--protesting against our brutalities to our enemies. there followed a whole column of extracts from foreign papers, with grotesque descriptions of our barbarities. to any one who knew the easygoing british soldier or the character of his leaders the thing was unspeakably absurd; and yet, as i laid down the paper and thought the matter over, i could not but admit that these continental people were acting under a generous and unselfish motive which was much to their credit. how could they help believing those things, and, believing them was it not their duty by meeting, by article, by any means, to denounce them? could we accuse them of being credulous? would we not be equally so if all our accounts of any transaction came from one side, and were supported by such journalists and, above all, such artists as lent their pens and pencils, whether venally or not, to the boer cause? of course we would. and whose fault was it that our side of the question was not equally laid before the jury of the civilized world? perhaps we were too proud, perhaps we were too negligent--but the fact was obvious that judgment was being given against us by default. how _could_ they know our case? where could they find it? if i were asked what document they could consult, what could i answer? blue-books and state papers are not for the multitude. there were books like fitz-patrick’s “transvaal from within” or e. t. cook’s “rights and wrongs”; but these were expensive volumes, and not readily translated. nowhere could be found a statement which covered the whole ground in a simple fashion. why didn’t some briton draw it up? and then like a bullet through my head, came the thought, “why don’t you draw it up yourself?” the next instant i was on fire with the idea. seldom in my life have i been so conscious of a direct imperative call which drove every other thought from the mind. if i were a humble advocate, it was all the better, since i could have no axe to grind. i was fairly well posted in the facts already, as i had written an interim history of the war. i had seen something of the campaign, and possessed many documents which bore upon the matter. my plans widened every instant. i would raise money from the public and by the sale of the book at home. with this i would translate it into every language. these translations should be given away wholesale. every professor, every clergyman, every journalist, every politician, should have one put under his nose in his own language. in future, if they traduced us, they could no longer plead ignorance that there was another side to the question. before i reached london all my programme was sketched out in my head. there was no item of it, i may add, which was not eventually carried through. fortune was my friend. i have said that i was dining that night with sir henry thompson. my neighbour at dinner was a gentleman whose name i had not caught. my mind being full of the one idea, my talk soon came round to it, and instead of my neighbour being bored, my remarks were received with a courteous and sympathetic attention which caused me to make even greater demands upon his patience. having listened from the soup to the savoury (often has my conscience rebuked me since), he ended by asking me mildly how i proposed to raise the money for these wide-reaching schemes. i answered that i would appeal to the public. he asked me how much would suffice. i answered that i could make a start with £1,000. he remarked that it would take much more than that. “however,” he added, “if £1,000 would go any way towards it, i have no doubt that sum could be got for you.” “from whom?” i asked. he gave me his name and address and said: “i have no doubt that if you carry out the scheme on the lines you suggest, i could get the money. when you have done your work, come to me, and we will see how it is best to proceed.” i promised to do so, and thanked him for his encouragement. sir eric barrington of the foreign office was the name of this fairy godfather. this was my first stroke of good luck. a second came next morning. i had occasion to call upon the publishing house of smith, elder & co., over some other business, and during the interview i told mr. reginald smith the plan that i had formed. without a moment’s hesitation he placed the whole machinery of his world-wide business at my disposal, without payment of any kind. from that moment he became my partner in the enterprise, and i found his counsel at every stage of as great help to me as the publishing services which he so generously rendered. not only did he save heavy costs to the fund, but he arranged easily and successfully those complex foreign transactions which the scheme entailed. that morning i called at the war office and was referred by them to the intelligence department, where every information which they possessed was freely put at my disposal. i then wrote to “the times” explaining what i was trying to do, and asking those who sympathized with my object to lend me their aid. never was an appeal more generously or rapidly answered. my morning post on the day after brought me 127 letters, nearly all of which contained sums drawn from every class of the community, varying from the £50 of lord rosebery to the half-crown of the widow of a private soldier. most of the remittances were accompanied by letters which showed that, however they might pretend in public to disregard it, the attitude of the foreign critics had really left a deep and bitter feeling in the hearts of our people. it was on january 9 that i was able to begin my task. on the 17th i had finished it. when the amount of matter is considered, and the number of researches and verifications which it entailed, i need not say that i had been absorbed in the work, and devoted, i dare say, sixteen hours a day to its accomplishment. so far as possible i kept my individual opinions in the background, and made a more effective case by marshalling the statements of eye-witnesses, many of them boers, on the various questions of farm-burnings, outrages, concentration camps, and other contentious subjects. i made the comments as simple and as short as i could, while as to the accuracy of my facts, i may say that, save as to the exact number of farmhouses burned, i have never heard of one which has been seriously questioned. it was a glad day for me when i was able to lay down my pen with the feeling that my statement was as full and as effective as it was in me to make it. meanwhile the subscriptions had still come steadily in, until nearly £1,000 more had been banked by the time that the booklet was finished. the greater number of contributions were in small sums from people who could ill afford it. one notable feature was the number of governesses and others residing abroad whose lives had been embittered by their inability to answer the slanders which were daily uttered in their presence. many of these sent their small donations. a second pleasing feature was the number of foreigners resident in england who supported my scheme, in the hope that it would aid their own people to form a juster view. from norwegians alone i received nearly £50 with this object. if britain’s own children too often betrayed her at a crisis of her fate, she found at least warm friends among the strangers within her gates. another point worth noting was that a disproportionate sum was from clergymen, which was explained by several of them as due to the fact that since the war began they had been pestered by anti-national literature, and took this means of protesting against it. the proofs having been printed, i sent them to my foreign office friend as i had promised, and presently received an invitation to see him. he expressed his approval of the work, and handed me a banknote for £500, at the same time explaining that the money did not come from him. i asked if i might acknowledge it as from an anonymous donor--“the donor would not object,” said my friend. so i was able to head my list with “a loyal briton,” who contributed £500. i daresay the secret service knew best whence the money came. by this time the banking account had risen to some two thousand pounds, and we were in a position to put our foreign translations in hand. the british edition had in the meantime been published, the distribution being placed in the hands of messrs. newnes, who gave the enterprise whole-hearted aid. the book was retailed at sixpence, but as it was our desire that the sale should be pushed it was sold to the trade at about threepence. the result was to leave the main profit of the enterprise in the hands of the retailer. the sale of the pamphlet was very large--in fact, i should imagine that it approached a record in the time. some 250,000 copies were sold in great britain very quickly, and about 300,000 within a couple of months. this great sale enabled us to add considerably to the fund by the accumulation of the small rebate which had been reserved upon each copy. our financial position was very strong, therefore, in dealing with the foreign translations. the french edition was prepared by professor sumichrast of harvard university, who was a french-canadian by birth. this gentleman patriotically refused to take any payment for his work, which was admirably done. it was published without difficulty by galignani, and several thousands were given away where they would do most good, in france, belgium, and switzerland. twenty thousand copies of this edition were printed. the german edition was a more difficult matter. no german publisher would undertake it, and the only courtesy which we met with in that country was from baron von tauchnitz, who included the volume in his well-known english library. our advances were met with coldness, and occasionally with insult. here, for example, is a copy of an extreme specimen of the kind of letter received. _january, 1902._ messrs. smith, elder & co.,-- gent,--doyle’s book makes the impression as if it was ordered or influenced by the english jingo party. now, you know, this english war party (as well as the english officers and soldiers in transvaal) are contempted by the whole civilised world as coward scoundrels and vile brutes who murder women and children. it would be for me, as an importer of english literature to germany, austria and russia, in the highest degree imprudent to do anything that could awake the suspicion i was in connection with so despised a party. i have shown your letter to several persons. nobody was inclined to take up the matter. there is a mixture of venom and smugness about this epistle which gives it a high place in my collection. in spite of rebuffs, however, i found an anglo-german publishing house in berlin to undertake the work, and with the assistance of herr curt von musgrave, who gave me an excellent translation, i was able to work off more than one very large edition, which had a perceptible effect in modifying the tone of that portion of the german press which was open to reason. altogether 20,000 copies were distributed in the fatherland and german-speaking austria. i remember one whimsical incident at this time. somewhat tired, after the book was in the press, i went down to seaford for a rest. while there, a message reached me that a pan-german officer of landwehr had come over to london, and desired to see me. i wired that i could not come up, but that i should be happy to see him if he came down. down he came accordingly, a fine, upstanding, soldierly man, speaking excellent english. the german proofs had passed through his hands, and he was much distressed by the way in which i had spoken of the hostility which his countrymen had shown us, and its effect upon our feelings towards them. we sat all day and argued the question out. his great point, as a pan-german, was that some day both germany and britain would have to fight russia--britain for india, and germany perhaps for the baltic provinces. therefore they should keep in close touch with each other. i assured him that at the time the feeling in this country was much more bitter against germany than against russia. he doubted it. i suggested as a test that he should try the question upon any ’bus driver in london as a fair index of popular opinion. he was very anxious that i should modify certain paragraphs, and i was equally determined not to do so, as i was convinced they were true. finally, when he left me on his return to london he said, “well, i have come 800 miles to see you, and i ask you now as a final request that in the translation you will allow the one word ‘leider’ (‘alas’) to be put at the opening of that paragraph.” i was perfectly ready to agree to this. so he got one word in exchange for 1,600 miles of travel, and i think it was a very sporting venture. one charming incident connected with this german translation was that a small group of swiss (and in no country had we such warm-hearted friends as among the minority in switzerland) were so keen upon the cause that they had a translation and an edition of their own, with large print and maps. it was published independently at zurich, dr. angst, the british consul in that town, helping to organize it. amongst other good friends who worked hard for the truth, and exposed themselves to much obloquy in doing so, were professor naville, the eminent egyptologist of geneva, and monsieur talichet, the well-known editor of the “bibliothèque universelle” of lausanne, who sacrificed the circulation of his old-established magazine in upholding our cause. so much for the french and german editions. the american and canadian had arranged themselves. there remained the spanish, portuguese, italian, hungarian, and russian, all of which were rapidly prepared and circulated without a hitch, save that in the case of the russian, which was published at odessa, the censor suppressed it at the last instant. we were successful, however, in getting his veto removed. in each of these countries several thousands of the booklet were given away. in every case we found a larger sale for these foreign editions than we expected, arising no doubt from the eagerness of english residents abroad to make their neighbours understand our position. the dutch edition was a stumbling-block. this gallant little nation felt a most natural sympathy for their kinsfolk in arms against us, and honestly believed that they had been very badly used. we should certainly have felt the same. the result was that we were entirely unable to find either publisher or distributor. the greater the opposition the more obvious was the need for the book, so mr. reginald smith arranged that a large edition should be printed here, and sent direct to all leaders of dutch opinion. i believe that out of some 5,000 copies not more than twenty were sent back to us. the norwegian edition also presented some difficulties which were overcome by the assistance of mr. thomassen of the “verdensgang.” this gentleman’s paper was entirely opposed to us, but in the interests of fair play he helped me to get my book before the public. i hope that some relaxation in his attitude towards us in his paper may have been due to a fuller comprehension of our case, and a realization of the fact that a nation does not make great sacrifices extending over years for an ignoble cause. one other incident in connection with the norwegian edition is pleasant for me to recall. i had prefaced each continental version with a special foreword, designed to arrest the attention of the particular people whom i was addressing. in this case, when the book was going to press in christiania, the preface had not arrived from the translator (the accomplished madame brockmann), and as she lived a hundred miles off, with all the passes blocked by a phenomenal snow-storm, it looked as if it must be omitted. finally, however, my short address to the scandinavian people was heliographed across from snow-peak to snow-peak, and so found its way to the book. there was one other language into which the book needed to be translated, and that was the welsh, for the vernacular press of the principality was almost entirely pro-boer, and the welsh people had the most distorted information as to the cause for which their fellow-countrymen fought so bravely in the field. the translation was done by mr. w. evans, and some 10,000 copies were printed for distribution through the agency of the cardiff “western mail.” this finished our labours. our total output was 300,000 of the british edition, about 50,000 in canada and the united states, 20,000 in germany, 20,000 in france, 5,000 in holland, 10,000 in wales, 8,000 in hungary, 5,000 in norway and sweden, 3,500 in portugal, 10,000 in spain, 5,000 in italy, and 5,000 in russia. there were editions in tamil and kanarese, the numbers of which i do not know. in all, i have seen twenty different presentments of my little book. the total sum at our disposal amounted to about £5,000, of which, speaking roughly, half came from subscriptions and the other half was earned by the book itself. it was not long before we had the most gratifying evidence of the success of these efforts. there was a rapid and marked change in the tone of the whole continental press, which may have been a coincidence, but was certainly a pleasing one. in the case of many important organs of public opinion there could, however, be no question of coincidence, as the arguments advanced in the booklet and the facts quoted were cited in their leading articles as having modified their former anti-british views. this was the case with the “tagblatt,” of vienna, whose london representative, dr. maurice ernst, helped me in every way to approach the austrian public. so it was also with the “national zeitung” in berlin, the “independance belge” in brussels, and many others. in the greater number of cases, however, it was unreasonable to suppose that a journal would publicly eat its own words, and the best result for which we could hope was that which we often attained, an altered and less acrimonious tone. mr. reginald smith and i now found ourselves in the very pleasant position of having accomplished our work so far as we could do it, and yet of having in hand a considerable sum of money. what were we to do with it? to return it to subscribers was impossible, and indeed at least half of it would have to be returned to ourselves since it had been earned by the sale of the book. i felt that the subscribers had given me a free hand with the money, to use it to the best of my judgment for national aims. our first expense was in immediate connection with the object in view, for we endeavoured to supplement the effect of the booklet by circulating a large number of an excellent austrian work, “recht und unrecht im burenkrieg,” by dr. ferdinand hirz. six hundred of these were distributed where they might do most good. our next move was to purchase half a dozen very handsome gold cigarette cases. on the back of each was engraved, “from friends in england to a friend of england.” these were distributed to a few of those who had stood most staunchly by us. one went to the eminent french publicist, monsieur yves guyot, a second to monsieur talichet of lausanne, a third to mr. sumichrast, and a fourth to professor naville. by a happy coincidence the latter gentleman happened to be in this country at the time, and i had the pleasure of slipping the small souvenir into his hand as he put on his overcoat in the hall of the athenæum club. i have seldom seen anyone look more surprised. there remained a considerable sum, and mr. reginald smith shared my opinion that we should find some permanent use for it, and that this use should bring benefit to natives of south africa. we therefore forwarded £1,000 to edinburgh university, to be so invested as to give a return of £40 a year, which should be devoted to the south african student who acquitted himself with most distinction. there are many afrikander students at edinburgh, and we imagined that we had hit upon a pleasing common interest for boer and for briton; but i confess that i was rather amazed when at the end of the first year i received a letter from a student expressing his confidence that he would win the bursary, and adding that there could be no question as to his eligibility, as he was a full-blooded zulu. the fund, however, was by no means exhausted, and we were able to make contributions to the civilian rifleman’s movement, to the union jack club, to the indian famine, to the japanese nursing, to the irish old soldiers’ institute, to the fund for distressed boers, and to many other deserving objects. these donations varied from fifty guineas to ten. finally we were left with a residuum which amounted to £309 0_s._ 4_d._ mr. reginald smith and i sat in solemn conclave over this sum, and discussed how it might best be used for the needs of the empire. the fourpence presented no difficulty, for we worked it off upon the crossing sweeper outside, who had helped to relieve delhi. nine pounds went in tobacco for the chelsea veterans at christmas. there remained the good round sum of £300. we bethought us of the saying that the safety of the empire might depend upon a single shot from a twelve-inch gun, and we devoted the whole amount to a magnificent cup, to be shot for by the various ships of the channel squadron, the winner to hold it for a single year. the stand of the cup was from the oak timbers of the _victory_, and the trophy itself was a splendid one in solid silver gilt. by the kind and judicious co-operation of admiral sir percy scott, the inspector of target practice, through whose hands the trophy passed to the senior admiral afloat, sir arthur wilson, v.c., in command of the channel squadron, all difficulties were overcome and the cup was shot for that year, and has since produced, i am told, great emulation among the various crews. our one condition was that it should not be retained in the mess-room, but should be put out on the deck where the winning bluejackets could continually see it. i learn that the _exmouth_ came into plymouth harbour with the cup on the top of her fore turret. the one abiding impression left upon my mind by the whole episode is that our government does not use publicity enough in stating and defending its own case. if a private individual could by spending £3,000 and putting in a month’s work make a marked impression upon the public opinion of the world, what could be done by a really rich and intelligent organization? but the first requisite is that you should honestly have a just cause to state. who is there outside england who really knows the repeated and honest efforts made by us to settle the eternal irish question and hold the scales fair between rival irishmen? we certainly do, as a great frenchman said, “defend ourselves very badly.” if we let cases go by default how can we imagine that the verdict can be in our favour? chapter xx my political adventures central edinburgh--a knock-out--the border burghs--tariff reform--heckling--interpolations--defeat--reflections. i have twice stood for parliament, though if anyone were to ask me my real reasons for doing so i should find it difficult to give them an intelligible answer. it certainly was from no burning desire to join that august assembly, for in each case i deliberately contested seats which every expert considered to be impossible, and though on one occasion i very nearly proved the experts to be wrong, my action is none the less a sign that i had no great wish to be at the head of the poll, for other and easier seats had been offered me. in the case of central edinburgh, for which i stood in the 1900 election, there may have been some sentimental call, for it was the section of the city where i was educated and where much of my boyhood was spent. it was said to be the premier radical stronghold of scotland, and to carry it would be a fine exploit, for though i was a good deal of a radical myself in many ways, i knew that it would be a national disgrace and possibly an imperial disaster if we did not carry the boer war to complete success, and that was the real issue before the electors. i believe that providence one way or another gets a man’s full powers out of him, but that it is essential that the man himself should co-operate to the extent of putting himself in the way of achievement. give yourself the chance always. if it is so fated, you will win through. if your path lies elsewhere, then you have got your sign through your failure. but do not put yourself in the position later in life of looking back and saying, “perhaps i might have had a career there had i tried.” deep in my bones i felt that i was on earth for some big purpose, and it was only by trying that i could tell that the purpose was not political, though i could never imagine myself as fettered to a party or as thinking that all virtues lay with one set of men. my political work was not wasted. i stood in the two most heckling constituencies in scotland, and through that odious and much-abused custom i gained a coolness on the platform and a disregard for interruption and clamour, which have stood me in good stead since. indeed, i hold that it was to fashion me more perfectly for my ultimate work that i was twice passed through this furnace. i remember that once at hawick my soldier brother came to see how i was getting on, and was struck by the effect which i had upon my audience. “it would be strange, arthur,” said he, “if your real career should prove to be political and not literary.” “it will be neither. it will be religious,” said i. then we looked at each other in surprise and both burst out laughing. the answer seemed quite absurd and pointless, for no remote possibility of such a thing suggested itself. it was a curious example of that unconscious power of prophecy which is latent within us. i had hardly landed from south africa when i flung myself into the edinburgh contest. mr. cranston, later sir robert cranston, a well-known citizen, was my chairman. when i arrived a small meeting was held, and i, a weary man, listened while it was gravely debated, with much weighing of pros and cons, what my view was to be on each of the vital questions. finally it was all settled to their satisfaction and written down, preparatory to forming the election address. i had listened with some amusement, and when it was all over i said: “gentlemen, may i ask who is going to honour these promises that you are making?” “why, you, of course,” said they. “then i think it would be better if i made them,” said i, and, crumpling up their document, i picked up a pen and wrote out my own views and my own address. it was well received and would have won the election against enormous odds--some thousands of votes at the last trial--were it not for a very unexpected intervention. those who remember the election will bear me out that it was an exciting affair. my opponent was a mr. brown, a member of nelson’s publishing firm, which had large works in the constituency. i was fresh from the scene of war and overflowing with zeal to help the army, so i spared myself in no way. i spoke from barrels in the street or any other pedestal i could find, holding many wayside meetings besides my big meetings in the evening, which were always crowded and uproarious. there was nothing which i could have done and did not do. my opponent was not formidable, but i had against me an overwhelming party machine with its registered lists, and record of unbroken victory. it was no light matter to change the vote of a scotsman, and many of them would as soon think of changing their religion. one serious mischance occurred. i was determined to do and say nothing which i did not heartily mean, and this united ireland, north and south, for the first time in history. the irish vote was considerable, so that this was important. the south quarrelled with me because, though i favoured some devolution, i was not yet converted to home rule. the north was angry because i was in favour of a catholic university for dublin. so i had no votes from ireland. when i went down to hold a meeting in a hall in the cowgate, which is the irish quarter, i was told that it had been arranged to break my platform up. this seems to have been true, but fortunately i got on good human terms with my audience, and indeed moved some of them to tears, by telling them of the meeting between the two battalions of the royal dublin fusiliers at ladysmith. so it happened that when a sinister-looking figure, a local horse-slaughterer, appeared on the edge of the stage, he was received in silence. he moved slowly across and said something about free speech. i felt that if i or my people were violent there would be a riot, so i simply said: “trot along, sonny, trot along!” he did trot along and disappeared on the other side of the stage. after the transit of this sinister star, and my temporary eclipse, all went well to the end. as the day of the election approached, it became more and more evident that i was getting dangerous, but i was knocked out--fortunately for myself, as i now discern--by a curious interference. there was an evangelical fanatic named plimmer living at dunfermline who thought it his special mission in life to keep roman catholic candidates out of parliament. therefore at the eleventh hour, the very night before the voting, the whole district was placarded with big sheets to say that i was a roman catholic, that i had been educated by jesuits, and in fact that my whole candidature was an attack upon kirk and covenant and lesser catechism and everything dear to the scottish heart. it was very cleverly done, and of course this fanatic alone could not have paid the expenses, though i cannot believe that mr. brown knew anything of the matter. my unhappy supporters saw crowds of workmen reading these absurd placards and calling out, “i’ve done with him!” as it was i very narrowly missed the seat, being only beaten by a few hundred votes. the question of an appeal came along, but the thing was so clever that it really was difficult to handle, since it was true enough that i had been educated by jesuits and yet absurdly untrue that this education influenced my present frame of mind. therefore we had to leave it alone. looking back, i am inclined to look upon mr. plimmer as one of the great benefactors of my life. he altered the points at the last moment and prevented me from being shunted on to a side-line which would perhaps have taken me to a dead end. i could never have been a party man, and there seems no place under our system for anyone else. at the moment i was a little sore, and i wrote a letter to the “scotsman” which defined my religious position as it was then, and caused, i believe, no little comment. i had the following letter from sir john boraston, who was the party organizer. the first sentence refers to the possibility of lodging a legal protest. 6 great george street, westminster, london, s.w. _october 18, 1900._ dear dr. doyle,-- probably your edinburgh advisers are right, but it is undoubtedly a misfortune that the perpetrators of attacks such as that which was made upon you should be allowed to go unpunished. your fight was indeed a phenomenal one, and you have the consolation of knowing that if you did not actually win a seat for yourself, you did materially contribute to the liberal unionist victories in two other edinburgh constituencies--this is generally admitted. i am sure you will feel that your first entry into active political life promises a full measure of success at no distant date, and i hope i may see you again before long to talk matters over. yours very truly, (_sgd._) john boraston. i had no further urge to try political adventures, but when the tariff reform election of 1905 came round i felt that i should make some sacrifice for the faith that was in me. mr. “tommy” shaw, as he was called--now lord shaw--was one of the most energetic radicals in scotland, and was reputed to be most firmly established in his seat, which was called “the border burghs,” consisting of the small towns of hawick, galashiels and selkirk, all of them engaged in the woollen trade, and all of them hard hit by german competition. it seemed to me that if there was a good field anywhere for mr. joseph chamberlain’s views on a protective tariff it should be there, where an open market had caused such distress and loss. my reasoning was sound enough, but i had not reckoned upon the innate conservatism of the scottish character, which cannot readjust its general principles to meet the particular case--a noble trait, but occasionally an unpractical one. party politics are not a divine law, but simply a means to an end, which must adjust itself as the end varies. this time i really expended a good deal of work as well as money upon the attempt, for if you stand for others besides yourself you have no choice but to work up to the last pound of steam. i might have added my neck to the other things which i risked, for in an endeavour to get into comradeship with the people i joined in what is known as the “common-riding” at hawick, where a general holiday is proclaimed while the bounds of the common are ridden over and defined. part of the proceedings was that each mounted man had to gallop full-split down the high road over a measured course of half a mile or so, the burghers lining the way and helping one by waving sticks and umbrellas. i was mounted on a hunter which i had never seen before, and which was full of spirit. fortunately this monstrous road performance came off late in the afternoon, and i had taken some of the spirit out of him by our ride round the common. i do not profess to be a great horseman, and i certainly nearly made the acquaintance of the hawick turnpike. sooner or later some one will be killed at that game, and horses must be lamed every year. afterwards an interminable ballad was recited with a sort of jingling chorus to which all who are near the reciter keep time with their feet. as it would seem unsympathetic not to join in, i also kept time with the rhythm, and was amused and amazed when i got back to london to see in the papers that i had danced a hornpipe in public before the electors. altogether i had no desire to face another hawick common-riding. the trouble in dealing with a three-town constituency, each town very jealous of the others, is that whatever you do has to be done thrice or you give offence. i was therefore heartily sick of the preparation and only too pleased when the actual election came off. i thought then, and i think now, that a sliding tariff, if only as an instrument for bargaining, would be altogether to our interest in this country, and would possibly cause some of our rivals to cease closing their markets to us, while they freely use the open market which we present. i still think that chamberlain’s whole scheme was an admirable one, and that it was defeated by a campaign of misrepresentation and actual lying, in which chinese labour and dear food played a chief part. i stood among the ruins of a dismantled factory in the border burghs and i showed how it had been destroyed by german competition, and how while we let their goods in free they were levying taxes on ours and spending the money so gained upon warships with which we might some day have to reckon. the answer to my arguments consisted largely of coloured cartoons of chinamen working in chains in the mines of the transvaal, and other nonsense of the sort. i worked very hard, so hard that on the last night of the election i addressed meetings in each of the three towns, which, as they are separated by many miles of hilly roads, is a feat never done, i understand, before or since. however, it was of no avail and i was beaten, though i believe i am right in saying that the party showed a less decrease of votes than in any constituency in scotland. the thing which annoyed me most about the election was that my opponent, tommy shaw, only appeared once, so far as i remember, in the constituency, and did everything by deputy, so that i found myself like a boxer who is punching his rival’s second instead of himself all the time. i had the melancholy satisfaction of noting that the radical chairman who was so engrossed in the wrongs of chinamen in the transvaal went into liquidation within a few months, giving as his reason the pressure of foreign competition in the woollen trade. it is a vile business this electioneering, though no doubt it is chastening in its effects. they say that mud-baths are healthy and purifying, and i can compare it to nothing else. this applies particularly, i think, to scotland, where the art of heckling has been carried to extremes. this asking of questions was an excellent thing so long as it was honest in its desire to know the candidate’s opinion upon a public measure. but the honest questions are the exception and the unfortunate man is baited by all sorts of senseless trick questions from mischievous and irresponsible persons, which are designed to annoy him and make him seem foolish or ignorant. some reform is badly needed in this matter. often, after a speech of an hour, i had an hour of questions, one more absurd than another. the press records will show, i hope, that i held my own, for i knew my subject well, and by this time i had had a good schooling on the platform. sometimes i countered heavily. i remember one robust individual coming down with a carefully prepared question which he shouted from the back of the hall. i had been speaking of retaliation in commercial tariffs, and his question was: “mister candidate, how do you reconcile retaliation with the sermon on the mount?” i answered: “we cannot in life always reach the highest ideals. have _you_ sold all and given to the poor?” the man was locally famous as having done nothing of the sort, and there was a howl of delight at my answer which fairly drove him out of the hall. there is a peculiar dry scottish wit which is very effective when you get it on your side. i remember one solemn person who had a loaf on the end of a pole which he protruded towards me, as if it were a death’s-head, from the side box of the theatre in which i spoke. the implication was, i suppose, that i would raise the price of bread. it was difficult to ignore the thing and yet puzzling how to meet it, but one of my people in broad doric cried: “tak’ it hame and eat it!” which quite spoilt the effect. usually these interpolations are delivered in a dreamy impersonal sort of voice. when, in talking of the transvaal war, i said with some passion, “who is going to pay for this war?” a seedy-looking person standing against the side wall said, “i’m no’ carin’!” which made both me and the audience laugh. again i remember my speech being quite interrupted by a joke which was lost upon me. i had spoken of the self-respect and decent attire of american factory hands. “gang and look at broon’s,” said the dreamy voice. i have never yet learned whether brown’s factory was famous for tidiness or the reverse, but the remark convulsed the audience. the radicals used to attend my meetings in great numbers, so that really, i think, they were often hostile audiences which i addressed. since their own candidate held hardly any meetings i was the only fun to be had. before the meeting the packed house would indulge in cries and counter-cries with rival songs and slogans, so that as i approached the building it sounded like feeding-time at the zoo. my heart often sank within me as i listened to the uproar, and i would ask myself what on earth i meant by placing myself in such a position. once on the platform, however, my fighting blood warmed up, and i did not quail before any clamour. it was all a great education for the future, though i did not realize it at the time, but followed blindly where some strange inward instinct led me on. what tired me most was the personal liberties taken by vulgar people, which is a very different thing from poor people, whom i usually find to be very delicate in their feelings. i take a liberty with no man, and there is something in me which rises up in anger if any man takes a liberty with me. a candidate cannot say all he thinks on this matter, or his party may suffer. i was always on my guard lest i should give offence in this way, and i well remember how on one occasion i stood during a three days’ campaign a good many indignities with exemplary patience. i was on edge, however, and as luck would have it, at the very last moment, as i stood on the platform waiting for the london train, one of my own people, an exuberant young bounder, came up with a loud familiar greeting and squeezed my right hand until my signet ring nearly cut me. it opened the sluice and out came a torrent of whaler language which i had hoped that i had long ago forgotten. the blast seemed to blow him bodily across the platform, and formed a strange farewell to my supporters. thus ended my career in politics. i could say with my friend kendrick bangs: “the electors have returned me--to the bosom of my family.” a very pleasant constituency it is. i had now thoroughly explored that path, and had assured myself that my life’s journey did not lie along it. and yet i was deeply convinced that public service was waiting for me somewhere. one likes to feel that one has some small practical influence upon the affairs of one’s time, but i encourage myself by the thought that though i have not been a public man, yet my utterances in several pamphlets and numerous letters in the press, may have had more weight with the public since i was disassociated from any political interest which could sway my judgment. chapter xxi the years between the wars “history of the war”--sir oliver lodge--military arguments--“sir nigel”--the edalji case--crowborough--the oscar slater case. when i returned from south africa, i found that my wife had improved in health during her stay at naples, and we were able to settle down once more at hindhead, where, what with work, cricket, and hunting, i had some pleasant years. a few pressing tasks were awaiting me, however. besides the barren contest at edinburgh i had done a history of the war, but the war still continued, and i had to modify it and keep it up to date in successive editions, until in 1902 it took final shape. i called it “the great boer war,” not because i thought the war “great” in the scale of history, but to distinguish it from the smaller boer war of 1881. it had the good fortune to please both friend and foe, for there was an article from one of the boer leaders in “cornhill” commending its impartial tone. it has been published now by nelson in a cheap edition, and shows every sign of being the permanent record of the campaign. no less than £27,000 was spent upon an official history, but i cannot find that there was anything in it which i had not already chronicled, save for those minute details of various forces which clog a narrative. i asked the chief official historian whether my book had been of use to him, and he very handsomely answered that it had been the spine round which he built. this history, which is a large-sized book, is not to be confused with the pamphlet “the cause and conduct of the war in south africa,” which was a small concise defence of the british position. the inception and result of this i have already described. i have no doubt that it was to the latter that my knighthood, and my appointment as deputy-lieutenant of surrey, both of which occurred in 1902, were due. i remember that on going down to buckingham palace to receive the accolade, i found that all who were waiting for various honours were herded into funny little pens, according to their style and degree, there to await their turn. it chanced that professor oliver lodge, who was knighted on the same morning, was penned with me, and we plunged at once into psychic talk, which made me forget where i was, or what i was there for. lodge was really more advanced and certain in his views than i was at that time, but i was quite sure about the truth of the phenomena, and only doubtful whether some alternative explanation might be found for a discarnate intelligence as the force at the back of them. this possibility i weighed for years before the evidence forced me to the spiritist conclusion. but when, among the cloud of lies with which we are constantly girt, i read that lodge and i were converted to our present views by the death of our respective sons, my mind goes back very clearly to that exchange of thought in 1902. at that time we had both studied the subject for many years. among the many congratulations which i had on my knighthood there were few which i valued more highly than that of my old comrade, h. a. gwynne, who knew so much about south african affairs. he was good enough to say: “i look upon your work during this terrible south african business as quite equal to that of a successful general.” this may well be the exaggeration of friendship, but it is at least pleasing to know that those who were in a position to judge did not look upon me as a mere busybody who butts in without due cause. there is one incident at this period which comes back to my memory, and seems very whimsical. i had taken a course of muscular development with mr. sandow, the strong man, and in that way had formed an acquaintance with him. in the winter of 1901 mr. sandow had a laudable desire to do something for the british wounded, and with that idea he announced a competition at the albert hall. he was himself to show feats of strength and then there was to be a muster of strong men who should exhibit their proportions and receive prizes. there were to be three prizes, a golden statue about two feet high, a silver replica, and a bronze. sandow asked lawes the sculptor and myself to be the two judges, he being referee. it proved to be a very big event. the albert hall was crowded. there were eighty competitors, each of whom had to stand on a pedestal, arrayed only in a leopard’s skin. lawes and i put them up ten at a time, chose one here and one there, and so gradually reduced the number until we only had six left. then it became excessively difficult, for they were all perfectly developed athletes. finally the matter was simplified by three extra prizes, and then we got down to the three winners, but had still to name their order, which was all-important since the value of the three prizes was so very different. the three men were all wonderful specimens, but one was a little clumsy and another a little short, so we gave the valuable gold statue to the middle one, whose name was murray, and who came from lancashire. the vast audience was very patient during our long judgment, and showed that it was in general agreement. after the meeting sandow had invited the prize-winners, the judges and a chosen company to a late supper, which was very sumptuous, with champagne flowing freely. when we had finished it was early in the morning. as i left the place of banquet i saw in front of me the winning athlete going forth into the london night with the big golden statue under his arm. i had seen that he was a very simple countryman, unused to london ways, so i overtook him and asked him what his plans were. he confided to me that he had no money, but he had a return ticket to bolton or blackburn, and his idea was to walk the streets until a train started for the north. it seemed to me a monstrous thing to allow him to wander about with his treasure at the mercy of any murderous gang, so i suggested that he should come back with me to morley’s hotel, where i was residing. we could not get a cab, and it seemed to me more grotesque than anything of steven’s london imaginings, that i should be wandering round at three in the morning in the company of a stranger who bore a great golden statue of a nude figure in his arms. when at last we reached the hotel i told the night porter to get him a room, saying at the same time, “mind you are civil to him, for he has just been declared to be the strongest man in england.” this went round the hotel, and i found that in the morning he held quite a reception, all the maids and waiters paying homage while he lay in bed with his statue beside him. he asked my advice as to selling it, for it was of considerable value and seemed a white elephant to a poor man. i told him he should open a gymnasium in his native town and have the statue exhibited as an advertisement. this he did, and i believe he has been very successful. a post-african task was the building up of rifle clubs, for i was enormously impressed by the power of the rifle as shown in the recent war. a soldier was no longer a specialized creature, but every brave man who could hold a rifle-barrel straight was a dangerous man. i founded the undershaw club, which was the father of many others, and which was inspected by lord roberts, mr. seeley and other great men. within a year or two england was dotted with village clubs, though i fear that few of them still hold their own. i was so struck by the factors in modern warfare and i had thought so much about them in africa that i wrote about them with some freedom and possibly even with some bitterness, so that i speedily found myself involved in hot controversy with colonel lonsdale hale, “the times” expert, and also with colonel maude, a well-known military writer. perhaps as a civilian i should have expressed my views in a more subdued way, but my feelings had been aroused by the conviction that the lives of our men, and even the honour of our country, had been jeopardized by the conservatism of the military and that it would so happen again unless more modern views prevailed. i continued to advance my theories for the next ten years, and i have no doubt, when i judge them by the experience of the great war, that in the main i was right. the points which i made were roughly as follows: that the rifle (or machine-gun, which is a modified rifle) is the supreme arbiter in war, and that therefore everything must be sacrificed to concentrate upon that. that the only place for swords, lances and all the frippery of the past was a museum. bayonets also are very questionable. that cavalry could not divide their allegiance between rifle and sword since entirely different ground and tactics are needed for each, the swordsman looking for level sward, the rifleman looking for cover. therefore all cavalry should at once become mounted rifles. that the very heaviest guns of our fortresses or battleships would be transported by road and used in the field in our next campaign. that field guns must take cover exactly as riflemen do. that the yeomanry, a very expensive force, should be turned into a cyclist organization. in view of the fine work done by the yeomanry, especially in the eastern deserts, i should reconsider the last item, and the bayonet question is debatable, but all the rest will stand. i stressed the fact also that the period of military training is placed too high, and that an excellent army could be rapidly vamped up if you had the right men. this also was proved by the war. i remember a debate which i attended as to the proper arms and use of cavalry. the cavalry were there in force, all manner of gallant fellows, moustached and debonnaire, inclined to glare at those who would disarm them. sir taubman-goldie was in the chair. three of us, all civilians, upheld the unpopular view that they should lose all their glory and become sombre but deadly riflemen. it is curious now to record that the three men were erskine childers, lionel amery and myself. childers was shot at dawn as a traitor to ireland as well as to britain, amery became first lord of the admiralty, and i write this memoir. i remember amery’s amusing comparison when he twitted the cavalry with wishing to retain the _arme blanche_ simply because their continental antagonists would have it. “if you fight a rhinoceros,” he said, “you don’t want to tie a horn on your nose.” it is an interesting commentary upon this discussion that on one morning during the war there were duels between two separate squadrons of british and german cavalry. the first two squadrons, who were lancers, rode through each other’s ranks twice with loss on either side and no conclusive result. in the second case german lancers charged british hussars, who dismounted, used their carbines, and simply annihilated the small force which attacked them. when my immediate preoccupations after the war had been got rid of, i settled down to attempt some literary work upon a larger and more ambitious scale than the sherlock holmes or brigadier gerard stories which had occupied so much of my time. the result was “sir nigel,” in which i reverted to the spacious days of the “white company,” and used some of the same characters. “sir nigel” represents in my opinion my high-water mark in literature, and though that mark may be on sand, still an author knows its comparative position to the others. it received no particular recognition from critics or public, which was, i admit, a disappointment to me. in england versatility is looked upon with distrust. you may write ballad tunes or you may write grand opera, but it cannot be admitted that the same man may be master of the whole musical range and do either with equal success. in 1906 my wife passed away after the long illness which she had borne with such exemplary patience. her end was painless and serene. the long fight had ended at last in defeat, but at least we had held the vital fort for thirteen years after every expert had said that it was untenable. for some time after these days of darkness i was unable to settle to work, until the edalji case came suddenly to turn my energies into an entirely unexpected channel. it was in the year 1907 that this notorious case took up much of my time, but it was not wasted, as it ended, after much labour, in partially rectifying a very serious miscarriage of justice. the facts of the case were a little complex and became more so as the matter proceeded. george edalji was a young law student, son of the reverend s. edalji, the parsee vicar of the parish of great wyrley, who had married an english lady. how the vicar came to be a parsee, or how a parsee came to be the vicar, i have no idea. perhaps some catholic-minded patron wished to demonstrate the universality of the anglican church. the experiment will not, i hope, be repeated, for though the vicar was an amiable and devoted man, the appearance of a coloured clergyman with a half-caste son in a rude, unrefined parish was bound to cause some regrettable situation. but no one could have foreseen how serious that situation would become. the family became the butt of certain malicious wags in the neighbourhood and were bombarded with anonymous letters, some of them of the most monstrous description. there was worse, however, to come. a horrible epidemic of horse-maiming had broken out, proceeding evidently from some blood-lusting lunatic of sadic propensities. these outrages continued for a long time, and the local police were naturally much criticized for doing nothing. it would have been as well had they continued to do nothing, for they ended by arresting george edalji for the crime, the main evidence being that there were signs that the writer of the anonymous letters knew something about the crimes, and that it was thought that young edalji had written the anonymous letters which had plagued his family so long. the evidence was incredibly weak, and yet the police, all pulling together and twisting all things to their end, managed to get a conviction at the stafford quarter sessions in 1903. the prisoner was sentenced to seven years’ penal servitude. there were some murmurs among discerning people at the time, and mr. voules, of “truth,” has an honourable record for having kept some sort of agitation going, but nothing practical was done until the unhappy youth had already served three years of his sentence. it was late in 1906 that i chanced to pick up an obscure paper called “the umpire,” and my eye caught an article which was a statement of his case, made by himself. as i read, the unmistakable accent of truth forced itself upon my attention and i realized that i was in the presence of an appalling tragedy, and that i was called upon to do what i could to set it right. i got other papers on the case, studied the original trial, went up to staffordshire and saw the family, went over the scene of the crimes and finally wrote a series of articles on the case, which began in the “daily telegraph” of january 12, 1907. as i bargained that they should be non-copyright they were largely transferred to other papers, sold for a penny at street-curbs and generally had a very wide circulation, so that england soon rang with the wrongs of george edalji. these wrongs would have been almost comic had they not had so tragic an upshot. if the whole land had been raked, i do not think that it would have been possible to find a man who was so unlikely, and indeed so incapable, of committing such actions. he was of irreproachable character. nothing in his life had ever been urged against him. his old schoolmaster with years of experience testified to his mild and tractable disposition. he had served his time with a birmingham solicitor, who gave him the highest references. he had never shown traits of cruelty. he was so devoted to his work that he had won the highest honours in the legal classes, and he had already at the age of twenty-seven written a book upon railway law. finally he was a total abstainer, and so blind that he was unable to recognize any one at the distance of six yards. it was clear that the inherent improbability of such a man committing a long succession of bloody and brutal crimes was so great that it could only be met by the suggestion of insanity. there had never, however, been any indication even of eccentricity in george edalji. on the contrary, his statements of defence were measured and rational, and he had come through a series of experiences which might well have unhinged a weaker intellect. the original theory at the trial had been that edalji had committed the particular mutilations with which he was charged some time in the evening. this line of attack broke down completely, and he was able to advance a certain _alibi_. in the middle of the case, therefore, the police prosecution shifted its ground and advanced the new theory that it was done in the early hours of the morning. george edalji, as it happened, slept in the same room as his father, the parish vicar. the latter is a light sleeper and is accustomed, as many people are, to assure privacy by turning the key of his room. he swore that george never left the room during the night. this may not constitute an absolute _alibi_ in the eye of the law, but it is difficult to imagine anything nearer to one unless a sentinel had been placed outside the door all night. it is so near an _alibi_ that nothing but the most cogent considerations could shake it, but far from there being any such considerations, the case was such a thing of threads and patches that one cannot imagine how any sane jury could have accepted it, even though the defence was weakly conducted. so bad was this defence that in the whole trial no mention, so far as i could ascertain, was ever made of the fact that the man was practically blind, save in good light, while between his house and the place where the mutilation was committed lay the full breadth of the london and north-western railway, an expanse of rails, wires and other obstacles, with hedges to be forced on either side, so that i, a strong and active man, in broad daylight found it a hard matter to pass. what aroused my indignation and gave me the driving force to carry the thing through was the utter helplessness of this forlorn little group of people, the coloured clergyman in his strange position, the brave blue-eyed, grey-haired wife, the young daughter, baited by brutal boors and having the police, who should have been their natural protectors, adopting from the beginning a harsh tone towards them and accusing them, beyond all sense and reason, of being the cause of their own troubles and of persecuting and maligning themselves. such an exhibition, sustained, i am sorry to say, by lord gladstone and all the forces of the home office, would have been incredible had i not actually examined the facts. the articles caused a storm of indignation through the country. “truth,” sir george lewis and other forces joined in the good work. a committee was formed by the government to examine and report. it consisted of sir arthur wilson, the hon. john lloyd wharton and sir albert de rutzen. their finding, which came to hand in june, was a compromise document, for though they were severe upon the condemnation of edalji and saw no evidence which associated him with the crime, they still clung to the theory that he had written the anonymous letters, that he had therefore been himself contributory to the miscarriage of justice, and that for this reason all compensation for his long period of suffering should be denied him. it was a wretched decision, and the law society at the prompting of sir george lewis showed what they thought of it by at once readmitting edalji to the roll of solicitors with leave to practise, which they would never have done had they thought him capable of dishonourable conduct. but the result stands. to this day this unfortunate man, whose humble family has paid many hundreds of pounds in expenses, has never been able to get one shilling of compensation for the wrong done. it is a blot upon the record of english justice, and even now it should be wiped out. it is to be remembered that the man was never tried for writing the letters--a charge which could not have been sustained--so that as the matter stands he has got no redress for three years of admitted false imprisonment, on the score that he did something else for which he has never been tried. what a travesty of justice! the “daily telegraph” got up a subscription for him which ran to some £300. the first use that he made of the money was to repay an old aunt who had advanced the funds for his defence. he came to my wedding reception, and there was no guest whom i was prouder to see. so far, my work had been satisfactory. where i caused myself great trouble was that in my local exploration at wyrley i had come across what seemed to me a very direct clue as to both the writer, or rather writers, of the letters, and also of the identity of the mutilator--though the latter word may also have been in the plural. i became interested, the more so as the facts were very complex and i had to do with people who were insane as well as criminal. i have several letters threatening my life in the same writing as those which assailed the edaljis--a fact which did not appear to shake in the least the home office conviction that george edalji had written them all. mentally i began to class the home office officials as insane also. the sad fact is that officialdom in england stands solid together, and that when you are forced to attack it you need not expect justice, but rather that you are up against an unavowed trade union the members of which are not going to act the blackleg to each other, and which subordinates the public interest to a false idea of loyalty. what confronts you is a determination to admit nothing which inculpates another official, and as to the idea of punishing another official for offences which have caused misery to helpless victims, it never comes within their horizon. even now, after the lapse of so many years, i can hardly think with patience of the handling of this case. the mistake that i made, so far as my own interests were concerned, was that having got on the track of the miscreant i let the police and the home office know my results before they were absolutely completed. there was a strong _primâ facie_ case, but it needed the goodwill and co-operation of the authorities to ram it home. that co-operation was wanting, which was intelligible, in the case of the local police, since it traversed their previous convictions and conclusions, but was inexcusable in the home office. the law officers of the crown upheld their view that there was not a _primâ facie_ case, but i fear that consciously or unconsciously the same trade union principle was at work. let me briefly state the case that the public may judge. i will call the suspect “x.” i was able to show: 1. that “x” had shown a peculiar knife or horse-lancet to some one and had stated that this knife did the crimes. i had this knife in my possession. 2. that this knife or a similar knife must have been used in _some_ of the crimes, as shown by the shallow incision. 3. that “x” had been trained in the slaughter-yard and the cattle-ship, and was accustomed to brutal treatment of animals. 4. that he had a clear record both of anonymous letters and of destructive propensities. 5. that his writing and that of his brother exactly fitted into the two writings of the anonymous letters. in this i had strong independent evidence. 6. that he had shown signs of periodical insanity, and that his household and bedroom were such that he could leave unseen at any hour of the night. there were very many corroborative evidences, but those were the main ones, coupled with the fact that when “x” was away for some years the letters and outrages stopped, but began again when he returned. on the other hand, when edalji was put in prison the outrages went on the same as before. it will hardly be believed that after i had laid these facts before the home office they managed to present the house of commons with the official legal opinion that there was not a _primâ facie_ case, while a high official of the government said to me: “i see no more evidence against these two brothers than against myself and my brother.” the points i mention are taken from the paper i laid before the law officers of the crown, which lies before me as i write, so the facts are exactly as stated. i had one letter in sorrow and also in anger from the staffordshire police complaining that i should be libelling this poor young man whose identity could easily be established. i do not know what has become of “x” or how often he has been convicted since, but on the last occasion of which i have notes the magistrate said in condemning him to six months’ imprisonment with hard labour: “his character was extremely bad, he having been convicted of arson, of stealing on three occasions and of damage. on his own confession he had committed a deliberate and cruel theft from his aged mother and it was impossible to overlook the seriousness of the case.” so much for the inoffensive youth whom i had libelled! but what about edalji’s three years of gaol? on september 18, 1907, i married miss jean leckie, the younger daughter of a blackheath family whom i had known for years, and who was a dear friend of my mother and sister. there are some things which one feels too intimately to be able to express, and i can only say that the years have passed without one shadow coming to mar even for a moment the sunshine of my indian summer which now deepens to a golden autumn. she and my three younger children with the kindly sympathy of my two elder ones have made my home an ideally happy one. my wife’s people had a house at crowborough, and there they had gone to reside. as they were very attached i thought it would be a happy arrangement not to separate them, so i bought a house close by, named “windlesham.” as i paid for it by a sum of money which i recovered after i had been unjustly defrauded of it, my friends suggested “swindlesham” as a more appropriate name. thus it came about that in 1907 i left undershaw, hindhead, after ten years’ residence, and moved myself and my belongings to the highlands of sussex, where i still dwell in the few months of settled life which give me a rest between my wanderings. very soon after my marriage, having just got clear of the edalji case, i became entangled in that of oscar slater. the one was in a way the cause of the other, for since i was generally given credit for having got edalji out of his troubles, it was hoped by those who believed that slater’s condemnation was a miscarriage of justice that i might be able to do the same for him. i went into the matter most reluctantly, but when i glanced at the facts, i saw that it was an even worse case than the edalji one, and that this unhappy man had in all probability no more to do with the murder for which he had been condemned than i had. i am convinced that when on being convicted he cried out to the judge that he never knew that such a woman as the murdered woman existed he was speaking the literal truth. in one respect the oscar slater case was not so serious as the edalji one, because slater was not a very desirable member of society. he had never, so far as is known, been in trouble as a criminal, but he was a gambler and adventurer of uncertain morals and dubious ways--a german jew by extraction, living under an alias. edalji, on the other hand, was a blameless youth. but in another aspect slater’s case was worse than that of edalji, since the charge was murder. he was very nearly hanged, and finally the life sentence was actually carried out, so that the wrong was never righted and at the present moment the unfortunate man is in gaol. it is a dreadful blot upon the administration of justice in scotland, and such judicial crimes are not, i am convinced, done with impunity even to the most humble. somehow--somewhere, there comes a national punishment in return. the case was roughly this: an elderly woman, miss gilchrist, was done to death most brutally in her flat, while her servant-maid, helen lambie, was absent for ten minutes on an errand. her head was beaten to pieces by some hard instrument. the neighbours were alarmed by the noise, and one of them, together with the maid, actually saw the murderer, a young man, leave the flat and pass him at the door. the police description at the time was by no means in agreement with slater’s appearance. robbery did not appear to be the motive of the crime, for nothing was missing unless it was a single diamond brooch. on the other hand, a box of papers had been broken into and left in disorder. the date was december 21, 1908. and now comes the great fact which is admitted by all, and which makes the whole case wildly improbable if not utterly impossible. it was thought that a diamond brooch had been taken. it was found out that a diamond brooch had also been pawned by the bohemian slater, who had started for america. was it not clear that he was the murderer? new york was warned. slater was arrested and in due time was returned to glasgow. then came the fiasco. it was found beyond all doubt that the brooch in question had been in slater’s possession for years, and that it had nothing to do with miss gilchrist at all. this should have been the end of the case. it was too preposterous to suppose that out of all the folk in glasgow the police had arrested the right man by pure chance--for that was what it amounted to. but the public had lost its head, and so had the police. if the case had completely gone to pieces surely it could be reconstructed in some fresh form. slater was poor and friendless. he had lived with a woman, which shocked scotch morality. as one writer boldly said in the press: “even if he did not do it, he deserved to be condemned, anyhow.” a case was made up in the most absurd manner. a half-crown card of tools was found in his box with the sort of tools which are found on such cards. the frail hammer was evidently the instrument which had beaten in the woman’s skull. the handle might have been cleaned. then surely there had been blood on it. the police description was already amended so as to be nearer to slater. he, a sallow, dark-haired jew, was picked out by witnesses from among a group of fair scotsmen. some one had been seen waiting in the street for some nights before. this some one was variously described by many witnesses. some descriptions would fit slater, some were his very opposite. the people who saw the murderer leave thought it might be slater, but were not sure. the chief witness, adams, was very short-sighted and had not his glasses. a clear _alibi_ was proved by slater, but as his mistress and his servant girl were the witnesses, it was not allowed. whom could he produce save the inmates of his house? no attempt was ever made to show that slater had any connection with miss gilchrist, or with the maid, lambie, and as slater was really a stranger in glasgow, it was impossible to see how he could have known anything about this retired old maid. but he was not too well defended, while mr. ure, the advocate-general of scotland, prosecuting for the state, thundered away in a most violent speech in which several statements were made, uncorrected by judge guthrie, which were very inexact, and which must have powerfully swayed the jury. finally, the crown got a conviction by nine votes to six (five “not proven”)--which, of course, would have meant a new trial in england, and the wretched foreigner was condemned to death. the scaffold was actually erected, and it was only two mornings before his execution that the order came which prevented a judicial murder. as it was, the man became a convict--and is one still. it is an atrocious story, and as i read it and realized the wickedness of it all, i was moved to do all i could for the man. i was aided by the opinion of sir herbert stephen, who read the evidence and declared that there was not even a _primâ facie_ case against the man. i, therefore, started a newspaper agitation and wrote a small book with an account of the whole matter. the consciences of some people responded, and finally we got up sufficient pressure to induce the government to appoint a commissioner, sheriff miller, to examine the case. it was all to no purpose, and the examination was a farce. the terms of reference were so narrow that the conduct of the police was entirely excluded, which was really the very thing at issue, since we held that where their original evidence failed them, they had strained many points in trying to build up a case and to obtain a verdict. it was also decided that evidence should not be on oath. the result was that there was no result nor could there be with such limitations. none the less, some fresh evidence was put forward which further weakened the already very weak case for the prosecution. for example, at the trial it had been stated that slater, on reaching liverpool from glasgow, had gone to a liverpool hotel under a false name, as if he were trying to throw the police off his track. it was shown that this was not true, and that he had signed the register with his own glasgow name. i say his glasgow name, for he had several pseudonyms in the course of his not too reputable career, and, as a fact, he took his actual passage under a false name, showing that he intended to make a clear start in america. he was, according to his own account, pursued by some woman--probably his lawful wife--and this covering of tracks was to escape this huntress. the fact that he used his own name at the hotel showed that the new name was for american rather than for british use, and that he had no fear of glasgow pursuit. we could do no more, and there the matter rested. there was a very ugly aftermath of the case, which consisted of what appeared to be persecution of mr. trench, a detective who had given evidence at the inquiry which told in favour of our view. a charge was shortly afterwards made against both him and a solicitor, mr. cook, who had been conspicuous upon slater’s side, which might well have ruined them both. as it was, it caused them great anxiety and expense. there had been a most unpleasant political flavour to the whole proceedings; but on this occasion the case came before a conservative judge, mr. scott dickson, who declared that it should never have been brought into court, and dismissed it forthwith with contempt. it is a curious circumstance that as i write, in 1924, judge guthrie, cook, trench, helen lambie, miller and others have all passed on. but slater still remains, eating out his heart at peterhead. one strange psychic fact should be mentioned which was brought to my notice by an eminent english k.c. there was a spiritualist circle which used to meet at falkirk, and shortly after the trial messages were received by it which purported to come from the murdered woman. she was asked what the weapon was which had slain her. she answered that it was an iron box-opener. now i had pondered over the nature of certain wounds in the woman’s face, which consisted of two cuts with a little bridge of unbroken skin between. they might have been caused by the claw end of a hammer, but on the other hand, one of the woman’s eyes had been pushed back into her brain, which could hardly have been done by a hammer, which would have burst the eyeball first. i could think of no instrument which would meet the case. but the box-opener would exactly do so, for it has a forked end which would make the double wound, and it is also straight so that it might very well penetrate to the brain, driving the eye in front of it. the reader will reasonably ask why did not the spiritualists ask the name of the criminal. i believe that they did and received a reply, but i do not think that such evidence could or should ever be used or published. it could only be useful as the starting point of an inquiry. * * * * * there was one intervention during those years to which i look back with satisfaction, and that was my protest against the king’s oath before the coronation of king edward. the oath was actually changed, and though my protest may have had no effect upon that historic fact, it was none the less the first letter in “the times” upon the subject. it ran thus: sir,-- surely colonel sandys and the members of the protestant reformation society should, looking at the matter simply from their own point of view, recognize that the surest way to strengthen any creed is, as the whole history of the world has proved, to persecute it. and it is mere juggling with words to attempt to show that it is anything other than persecution to hold up the roman catholic faith to obloquy in the coronation oath, while every other creed, christian or non-christian, is left unassailed. is it not a shocking thing that, while roman catholic chapels throughout the whole empire are still draped in black for a deceased monarch, his successor should be compelled by law to insult the most intimate convictions of these same mourners? and is it not a most narrow and foolish policy, unworthy of this tolerant age, that a young king should be forced to offend the feelings of great numbers of irishmen, canadians and other subjects? i feel sure that, apart from catholics, the great majority of broad-minded thinkers of any or of no denomination in this country are of opinion that the outcry of fanatics should be disregarded, and that all creeds should receive the same courteous and respectful treatment so long as their adherents are members of the common empire. to bring these medieval rancours to an end would indeed be an auspicious opening of a new reign. yours faithfully, arthur conan doyle. chapter xxii the years between the wars constantinople--the night of power--a strange creature--dorando--dramatic adventures--the congo agitation--olympic games--divorce reform--psychic experience--speculation. years of peaceful work followed my marriage, broken only by two journeys to the mediterranean, in the course of which we explored some out-of-the-way portions of greece, and visited egypt, where i found hardly one single man left of all the good fellows whom i had once known. in the course of our travels we visited constantinople, looking at the great guns in the forts on the dardanelles, with little thought of all the british lives which were to be sacrificed upon those low, dark, heather-clad hills which slope down to the northern shore. in constantinople we attended the weekly selamlik of abdul hamid, and saw him with his dyed beard and the ladies of his harem as they passed down to their devotions. it was an incredible sight to western eyes to see the crowd of officers and officials, many of them fat and short of wind, who ran like dogs behind his carriage in the hope that they might catch the imperial eye. it was ramadan, and the old sultan sent me a message that he had read my books and that he would gladly have seen me had it not been the holy month. he interviewed me through his chamberlain and presented me with the order of the medjedie, and, what was more pleasing to me, he gave the order of the chevekat to my wife. as this is the order of compassion, and as my wife ever since she set foot in constantinople had been endeavouring to feed the horde of starving dogs who roamed the streets, no gift could have been more appropriate. [illustration: lady conan doyle, 1920. _sterling, melbourne._] we were admitted secretly and by very special favour into the great mosque of sophia during the sacred festival which is known as the night of power. it was a most marvellous spectacle as from the upper circle of pillared arches we looked down upon 60,000 lighted lamps and 12,000 worshippers, who made, as they rose and fell in their devotions, a sound like the wash of the sea. the priests in their high pulpits were screaming like seagulls, and fanaticism was in the air. it was at this moment that i saw a woman--i will not call her a lady--young and flighty, seat herself jauntily on the edge of the stone parapet, and look down at the 12,000 men who were facing us. no unbeliever should be tolerated there, and a woman was the abomination of abominations. i heard a low deep growl and saw fierce bearded faces looking up. it only needed one fiery spirit to head the rush and we should have been massacred--with the poor consolation that some of us at least had really asked for it. however, she was pulled down, and we made our way as quickly and as quietly as possible out of a side door. it was time, i think. one curious incident of our journey stands out in my memory. we were steaming past ægina on a lovely day with calm water around us. the captain, a courteous italian, had allowed us to go upon the bridge, and we--my wife and i--were looking down into the transparent depths when we both clearly saw a creature which has never, so far as i know, been described by science. it was exactly like a young ichthyosaurus, about 4 feet long, with thin neck and tail, and four marked side-flippers. the ship had passed it before we could call any other observer. i was interested to notice that admiral anstruther in the “evening news” some years later described, and drew, an exactly similar creature which he had seen under water off the irish coast. this old world has got some surprises for us yet. here and there, as i look back at those long and happy years, some particular episode flashes vividly into my memory. i do not often do journalistic work--why should one poach upon the preserves of others?--but on the occasion of the olympic games of 1908 i was tempted, chiefly by the offer of an excellent seat, to do the marathon race for the “daily mail.” it was certainly a wonderful experience, for it will be known to history as the dorando race. perhaps a few short paragraphs from my description may even now recapture the thrill of it. the huge crowd--some 50,000 people--were all watching the entrance to the stadium, the dark gap through which the leader must appear. then-- “at last he came. but how different from the exultant victor whom we expected! out of the dark archway there staggered a little man, with red running-drawers, a tiny boy-like creature. he reeled as he entered and faced the roar of the applause. then he feebly turned to the left and wearily trotted round the track. friends and encouragers were pressing round him. “suddenly the whole group stopped. there were wild gesticulations. men stooped and rose again. good heavens! he has fainted; is it possible that even at this last moment the prize may slip through his fingers? every eye slides round to that dark archway. no second man has yet appeared. then a great sigh of relief goes up. i do not think in all that great assembly any man would have wished victory to be torn at the last instant from this plucky little italian. he has won it. he should have it. “thank god, he is on his feet again--the little red legs going incoherently, but drumming hard, driven by a supreme will within. there is a groan as he falls once more and a cheer as he staggers to his feet. it is horrible, and yet fascinating, this struggle between a set purpose and an utterly exhausted frame. again, for a hundred yards, he ran in the same furious and yet uncertain gait. then again he collapsed, kind hands saving him from a heavy fall. “he was within a few yards of my seat. amid stooping figures and grasping hands i caught a glimpse of the haggard, yellow face, the glazed, expressionless eyes, the lank black hair streaked across the brow. surely he is done now. he cannot rise again. “from under the archway has darted the second runner, hayes, stars and stripes on his breast, going gallantly, well within his strength. there is only twenty yards to do if the italian can do it. he staggered up, no trace of intelligence upon his set face, and again the red legs broke into their strange automatic amble. “will he fall again? no, he sways, he balances, and then he is through the tape and into a score of friendly arms. he has gone to the extreme of human endurance. no roman of the prime ever bore himself better than dorando of the olympic of 1908. the great breed is not yet extinct.” of course the prize went to the american, as his rival had been helped, but the sympathy of the crowd, and i am sure of every sporting american present, went out to the little italian. i not only wrote dorando up, but i started a subscription for him in the “daily mail,” which realized over £300--a fortune in his italian village--so that he was able to start a baker’s shop, which he could not have done on an olympic medal. my wife made the presentation in english, which he could not understand; he answered in italian, which we could not understand; but i think we really did understand each other all the same. there is no denying that the american team were very unpopular in london, though the unpopularity was not national, for the stadium was thick with american flags. everyone admitted that they were a splendid lot of athletes, but they were not wisely handled and i saw with my own eyes that they did things which would not have been tolerated if done by an english team in new york. however, there may well have been some want of tact on both sides, and causes at work of which the public knew nothing. when i consider the dunraven yacht race, and then these olympic games, i am by no means assured that sport has that international effect for good which some people have claimed for it. i wonder whether any of the old grecian wars had their real origin in the awards at olympia. i may add that we had a dozen or so of the american boys down to “windlesham,” where we had a very pleasant day together. i found them all excellent fellows. i put up a billiard olympic prize, and one of them bore it off with him. the whole incident was very pleasant. my work for a few years after my marriage ran largely in the direction of drama, and if it was not lucrative it at least provided us with a good deal of amusement and excitement. in the case of one venture this excitement became a little too poignant, though all ended well in the end. i had dramatized “rodney stone” under the name of “the house of temperley,” with all the ring scenes and prize fights included, and treated in the most realistic fashion. we had an excellent boxing instructor who took one of the smaller parts and who not only fought himself but trained the others to a remarkable degree of skill. so realistic was it that when on the first night the bully, berks, after a long encounter, went down with a crash from a fine raking uppercut, there was an involuntary groan from the whole house, which meant as clearly as could be, “there now, you have killed a man for our amusement.” it was really incredibly well done and i could never have believed that such scenes could be so cleverly faked, though it was not always done with impunity, for rex davies, who played gloucester dick, assured me that he lost a tooth and broke both a finger and a rib during his engagement. the play itself was unequal, but was so very novel and sensational in its best scenes that it should have been a considerable success. i found no manager who would take the risk, and i had myself to take the adelphi theatre for a six months’ lease, at a rent which with the company worked out at about £600 a week. as on the top of this the production cost about £2,000, it will be seen that i was plunging rather deep. and luck did not favour us. the furore for boxing had not yet set in. ladies were afraid to come, and imagined it would be a brutal spectacle. those who did come were exhilarated beyond measure, but the prejudice still weighed heavily against us. then there came one of those theatrical slumps when everything goes wrong, and finally king edward died and that killed it outright. it was a very serious situation. i still had the theatre upon my hands. i might sublet it, or i might not. if i did not, the expense was simply ruinous. it was under these circumstances that, as i have already said, i wrote and rehearsed “the speckled band” in record time, and so saved the situation. the real fault of this play was that in trying to give holmes a worthy antagonist i overdid it and produced a more interesting personality in the villain. the terrible ending was also against it. however, it was a considerable success and saved a difficult--almost a desperate--situation. yet another theatrical venture was my “fires of fate,” some of which is certainly the best dramatic work that i have ever done. it was unlucky, as it was produced in a very hot summer. i carried it at my own expense through the two impossible holiday months, but when lewis waller, who played the hero, returned from a provincial tour to london, he was keen on some new play and my “fires” were never really burned out. i fancy sometimes that they might even now flame up again if given a chance. i stage managed most of this play myself, and with curious results. there are certain dramatic conventionalities which can only be broken through by one who is not himself an actor. there was a scene where a number of helpless tourists, men and women, were brutally ill-treated by arabs. the brutality in rehearsal was conventional. i made the arabs get imitation whips and cudgels and really savage the poor travellers. the effect was novel and appalling. there was a young welsh officer in the front of the stalls who was a friend of my brother’s. he held both the v.c. and the d.s.o. so stirred was he by the sight that he could hardly be restrained from clambering on to the stage in order to help the unhappy tourists. the end of that act, when the drove of bleeding captives are led away and you hear the monotonous song of the arabs as they march, and you see lewis waller, who has been left for dead, struggle up on his elbow and signal across the nile for assistance, was one which brought the whole house to its feet. such moments to a dramatist give a thrill of personal satisfaction such as the most successful novelist never can feel. there is no more subtle pleasure if you are really satisfied with your work than to sit in the shadow of a box and watch not the play but the audience. i had one other dramatic venture, “brigadier gerard,” which also was mildly successful. in fact, i have never known failure on the stage save in the case of the unfortunate “jane annie.” lewis waller played the brigadier and a splendid dashing hussar he made. it was a glorious performance. i remember that in this play also i ran up against the conventionalities of the stage. i had a group of hussar officers, the remnants of the regiment which had gone through napoleon’s last campaign. when it came to the dress rehearsal, i found them, to my horror, dressed up in brand new uniforms of chestnut and silver. “good heavens!” i cried. “this is not a comic opera!” “what do you want done?” asked waller. “why,” said i, “these men are warriors, not ballet dancers. they have been out in all weathers day and night for months. every scrap of truth goes out of the play if they appear like that.” the uniforms had cost over a hundred pounds, but i covered them with mud and dust and tore holes in them. the result was that, with begrimed faces, i got a band of real napoleonic soldiers. waller himself insisted on retaining his grease paint and his nice new clothes, but i am sure every man in the audience, if not every woman, would have liked him better as i had made the others. poor lewis waller! there was some strange and wonderful blood in his veins. he was a glorious fellow, and his premature death a great blow to our stage. what virility! what a face and figure! they called him the “flappers’ idol,” and it reflects credit on the flapper, for where could she find a less sickly and more manly type. he caught his fatal illness in serving the soldiers. one of his greatest possessions was his voice. he came down to “windlesham” once, and as he was reciting in the music-room that wonderful resonant voice chanced to catch the exact note which corresponded to the curve of all the glass lampshades on the walls. they all started thrilling as a wine-glass does when it is touched. i could quite believe after that, that matter could be disintegrated by sound if the sound were strong enough. i am not clear what blood ran in waller’s veins, hebrew or basque or both. i only know that it went to make a very wonderful man. his intense feeling about everything that he did was one of his characteristics and no doubt a cause of his success. it did not carry him far in golf, however. i remember hearing him as he approached the last tee mutter, “god, give me _one_ good drive.” i fear, however, that the betting was against it. in 1910 a fresh task opened up before me. it arose from my being deeply moved by reading some of the evidence concerning the evil rule, not of belgium, but of the king of the belgians in the congo. i examined this evidence carefully before i accepted it, and i assured myself that it was supported by five british consuls and by lord cromer, as well as by travellers of many races, belgian, french, american, swedish and others. an attempt has been made since to minimize the facts and to pretend that roger casement had been at the back of the agitation for sinister purposes of his own. this contention is quite untenable and the evidence for the atrocities is overwhelming and from very many sources, the belgians themselves being among the best witnesses. i put in some two years working with mr. morel and occasionally lecturing in the country upon this question, and it was certainly the efforts of the congo association which we represented, that eventually brought the question to the notice of that noble man king albert which meant setting it right so that the colony is now, so far as i know, very well managed. casement, whom i shall always regard as a fine man afflicted with mania, has met his tragic end, and morel’s views upon the war have destroyed the feelings which i had for him, but i shall always maintain that they both did noble work in championing the wrongs of those unhappy and helpless negroes. my own book “the crime of the congo,” which was translated into all european languages, had also, i hope, some influence towards that end. in the early summer of 1912 i had a telegram from lord northcliffe which let me in for about as much trouble as any communication which i have ever received. it was to the effect that britain must regain her place among the athletic nations which had been temporarily eclipsed by the olympic games at stockholm, and that i was the one man in great britain who could rally round me the various discordant forces which had to be united and used. this was very complimentary, but it was lord northcliffe’s sole contribution to the matter for a very long time, and i was left to my own devices entirely in carrying out a complex task. so badly co-ordinated were northcliffe’s papers that i had some of them actually attacking me while i was working on their chief’s suggestion. when i examined i found chaos. on the one hand was the british olympic committee, a most sound and respectable body, under lord desborough. in some way they had lost touch with press and public and were generally in disfavour, though really they had done their best. on the other hand was “the times,” which had worked itself into a fury about the misdeeds of the committee, and had set a tone which poisoned the whole press against them. lord northcliffe would have nothing to do with anything which emanated from the committee; the committee defied lord northcliffe. it was clear that this had to be cleared up as a preliminary, and the matter took enough diplomacy to have settled the balkan question. i called upon the committee and suggested that an independent body be formed on which they could be represented. to this they agreed. i then called on “the times” and said: “you are no longer dealing with the old olympic committee, but with a new body. do you agree to this?” yes, that was all in order. i may have omitted the trifling fact that the new body did not yet exist. i then asked mr. studd, the famous cricketer of old and head of the polytechnic to help me to form the new body. we soon had a very effective one, including several leading athletes and lord forster, now governor-general of australia. i served, of course, on the committee, and soon we were in touch with every one and all promised to go smoothly. but presently a huge mistake was made. i don’t wish to represent myself as the fount of all wisdom, and no doubt i make as many slips as my fellows, but that particular one would never have been made had i been present, but i was called away and was out of the country at that crucial committee meeting. it had been already determined that an appeal to the public over all our names should be issued. the amount had not been discussed, but in my own mind i had thought that £10,000 would suffice. i was horrified, therefore, when i returned from my holiday to find that they had appealed for £100,000. the sum was absurd, and at once brought upon us from all sides the charge of developing professionalism. my position was very difficult. if i protested now it would go far to ruin the appeal. after all it might succeed. i could only fall into line with the others and do my best for the sake of the cause to defend a policy which i looked upon as mistaken. we actually collected about £7,000, and finally, as we found that the general feeling was either hostile or apathetic, we handed over this sum to the olympic committee. then came the war, and so in any case our labour was in vain, for the games were to be in berlin in 1916. we were all playing another game by then. this matter was spread over a year of my life and was the most barren thing that i ever touched, for nothing came of it, and i cannot trace that i ever received one word of thanks from any human being. i was on my guard against northcliffe telegrams after that. i remember one curious episode about that time. i was staying in a northumberland avenue hotel, and i walked out at night in pensive mood, strolling down the embankment and watching the great dark river with the gleam of the lights upon it. suddenly a man passed me, walking very rapidly and muttering in an incoherent way. he gave me an impression of desperation and i quickened my pace and followed him. with a rush he sprang up on the parapet and seemed to be about to throw himself into the river. i was just in time to catch his knees and to pull him down. he struggled hard to get up, but i put my arm through his and led him across the road. there i reasoned with him and examined into the cause of his troubles. he had had some domestic quarrel, i believe, but his main worry was his business, which was that of a baker. he seemed a respectable man and the case seemed genuine, so i calmed him down, gave him such immediate help as i could, and made him promise to return home and to keep in touch with me afterwards. when the excitement of the incident was over, i had grave doubts as to whether i had not been the victim of a clever swindler. i was considerably relieved, therefore, to get a letter a few days later, giving name and address, and obviously genuine. i lost sight of the case after that. another matter which preoccupied me much in the years before the war, and preoccupies me still, is the reform of our divorce laws. i was president of the reform union for ten years and have only just vacated the position in order to make room for a far more efficient successor in lord birkenhead. i am quite alive to all the arguments of our opponents, and quite understand that laxity in the marriage tie is an evil, but i cannot understand why england should lag behind every other protestant country in the world, and even behind scotland, so that unions which are obviously disgusting and degrading are maintained in this country while they can be dissolved in our colonies or abroad. as to morality i cannot, i fear, admit that our morality here is in the least better than in scandinavia, holland or germany, where they have more rational laws. i think that in some states in america they have pushed divorce to an extreme, but even in america i should say that married happiness and morality generally are quite as high as with us. the house of lords has shown itself to be more liberal in this matter than the commons, possibly because the latter have a fear of organized church influence in their constituencies. it is one of several questions which makes me not sorry to see labour, with its larger outlook, in power for a time in this country. our marriage laws, our land laws, the cheapening of justice and many other things have long called out for reform, and if the old parties will not do it then we must seek some new one which will. during these long and happy years, when the smooth current of our national life was quietly sliding toward niagara, i did not lose my interest in psychic matters, but i cannot say that i increased my grasp of the religious or spiritual side of the subject. i read, however, and investigated whenever the chance arose. a gentleman had arranged a series of psychical séances in a large studio in north london, and i attended them, the mediums being cecil husk and craddock. they left a very mixed impression upon my mind, for in some cases, i was filled with suspicion and in others i was quite sure that the result was genuine. the possibility that a genuine medium may be unscrupulous and that when these very elusive forces fail to act he may simulate them is one which greatly complicates the whole subject, but one can only concentrate upon what one is sure is true and try to draw conclusions from that. i remember that many sheeted ghosts walked about in the dim light of a red lamp on these occasions, and that some of them came close to me, within a foot of my face, and illuminated their features by the light of a phosphorescent slate held below them. one splendid arab, whom the medium called abdullah, came in this fashion. he had a face like an idealized w. g. grace, swarthy, black-bearded and dignified, rather larger than human. i was looking hard at this strange being, its nose a few inches from my own, and was wondering whether it could be some very clever bust of wax, when in an instant the mouth opened and a terrific yell was emitted. i nearly jumped out of my chair. i saw clearly the gleaming teeth and the red tongue. it certainly seemed that he had read my thought and had taken this very effective way of answering it. some of the excitements of my life during these and the subsequent years were due to financial entanglements which arose from a certain speculative element in my own nature, depending rather upon the love of adventure than upon any hope of gain. if when i earned money i had dug a hole in the garden and buried it there i should be a much richer man to-day. i can hardly blame the punter on the racecourse when i remember the outside chances which i have taken in the past in every possible form of speculation. but i have the advantage over the mere gambler in this, that every pound of my money went to develop something or other and lined the pocket of the working man, who, by the way, when he grumbles over the profits of the capitalist never even alludes to his losses. if a balance sheet were struck it would be interesting to see what, if any, is the exact margin of profit. it is true that sometimes i have indulged in a pure gamble but never for any sum which would hurt me. i have painful memories of a guano island off south africa on which our treasure seekers were not even allowed to land, though every bird’s nest was rumoured to contain a diamond. the spanish galleon in the bay of tobermory also took treasure rather than gave it, and the return for my shares was a lump of glass and a rusted bar. that was more than ever i had from certain spots in kalgurli and coolgardie and other alleged goldbearers, which have nearly all been gold consumers so far as i am concerned. i fear some of those mines were like that legendary one where the manager, getting a cable which ordered him to start crushing, replied, “i have nothing to crush until you return samples.” i have played my involuntary part also in the development of the rand and rhodesia, from those early and unsophisticated days when i misread the quotation and meaning to invest £60 was faced next morning with a bill for £900. occasionally it is true that i backed a winner, but as a rule i must confess that i was not judicious in my selections. but it was at home that i expended myself most freely. i saw the enormous possibilities of kent coal, which even now are not fully understood; but i did not sufficiently weigh the impossibilities, which are that an enterprise can be successful which is wildly financed and extravagantly handled. i and many others lost our money sinking the shafts which may bring fortunes to our successors. i even descended 1,000 feet through the chalk to see with my own eyes that the coal was _in situ_. it seems to have had the appearance and every other quality of coal save that it was incombustible, and when a dinner was held by the shareholders which was to be cooked by local coal, it was necessary to send out and buy something which would burn. there were, however, lower strata which were more sensitive to heat. besides kent coal i lost very heavily in running a manufacturing plant in birmingham, into which i was led by those successive stages in which you are continually trying to save what you have already invested until the situation becomes so serious that you drop it in terror. we turned from bicycles to munitions during the war, and actually worked hard the whole four years, with a hundred artisans making needful war material, without ever declaring a penny of dividend. this, i should think, must be a record, and at least no one could call us profiteers. the firm was eventually killed dead by the successive strikes of the moulders and the miners. it is amazing how one set of workmen will ruin another set without apparently any remonstrance from the sufferers. another bad egg was a sculpture machine for architectural work, which really had great possibilities, but we could not get the orders. i was chairman of this company, and it cost me two years of hard work and anxiety, ending up by my paying the balance out of my own pocket, so that we might wind up in an honourable way. it was a dismal experience with many side adventures attached to it, which would make a sensational novel. such are some of the vicissitudes which cannot be disregarded in a retrospect of life, for they form a very integral and absorbing part of it. i have had my ill luck and i have had my good. amid the latter i count the fact that i have been for twenty-one years a director of raphael tuck & co., without the least cloud to darken the long and pleasant memory. i have also been for many years chairman of besson’s famous brass instrument firm. i think a man should know all sides of life, and he has missed a very essential side if he has not played his part in commerce. in investments, too, i would not imply that i have always been unfortunate. my speculative adventures are over, and i can at least say that unless the british empire goes down i shall be able to retain enough for our modest needs. chapter xxiii some notable people president roosevelt--lord balfour--mr. asquith--lord haldane--george meredith--rudyard kipling--james barrie--henry irving--bernard shaw--r. l. s.--grant allen--james payn--henry thompson--royalty. when i have chanced during my life to come in contact with notable people, i have often made some short record at the time of what they said and how they impressed me. it is difficult, however, to use these notes for publication when you happen to have been a guest, and it can only be done, i think, by using one’s judgment and never consciously harming one’s host. if every one were altogether silent upon such occasions the most pleasing side of great contemporaries would never be chronicled, for the statesman in slippers is a very much more human and lovable person than the politician on the platform. among the great men that i have known president roosevelt occupied a prominent place. he was not a big, nor, so far as one could see, a powerful man, but he had tremendous dynamic force and an iron will which may account for his reputation as an athlete. he had all the simplicity of real greatness, speaking his mind with great frankness and in the clearest possible english. he had in him a great deal of the boy, a mischievous, adventurous, high-spirited boy, with a deep, strong, thoughtful manhood in the background. we were present, my wife and i, at the guildhall when he made his memorable speech about egypt, in which he informed a gathering, which contained the foreign secretary, sir edward grey, and many of our cabinet, that we should either rule more strictly or clear out altogether. it was, of course, a most unwarrantable intrusion into our affairs, but it was a calculated indiscretion, and very welcome, i believe, to those who were dealing with egypt. as he made his way through the dense crowd afterwards he passed me and said with a grin: “i say, i let them have it that time, didn’t i?” there was the mischievous boy coming out. he had a quick blunt wit which showed itself often in his metaphors. he spoke to me, i remember, of some one who had a nine guinea-pig-power brain. one of his entourage told me how the president had been awakened once to address some prairie folk at a wayside station. “they have come sixty miles to see you,” said his secretary. “they would have come a hundred to see a cat with two heads,” said the ruffled president. i met him once at a small luncheon party at the invitation of lord lee, who had soldiered with him in cuba. he was extremely talkative--in fact, i can hardly remember anyone else saying anything. thinking it over afterwards i concluded that two ideas were running through his mind, and every now and then coming to the surface. they were formidable ideas, and may have been some temporary wave of feeling, but they were certainly in his thoughts. the one was that there would be another civil war in the states. the second, that if you had the farmer class on your side they presented the best military material. from this i gathered that it was not a geographical but an economic struggle that was in his mind. _absit omen_, but great men are often pessimists, and the duke of wellington was deeply convinced that britain could not long survive his death. when roosevelt was shot i sent him a cable to express that sympathy which every englishman felt. i have his answer before me, written only a day or so after the event: mercy hospital, chicago, _october 19, 1912_. dear mr. doyle,-- many thanks for your kind message of sympathy. as you know, a bullet wound is rather a serious thing, but all conditions seem to be favourable, and i hope in a few days we will all be relieved from anxiety. sincerely yours, theodore roosevelt. it is typewritten, but signed by his own hand. i do not think that a more brave and detached letter was ever written by a sufferer. roosevelt was a very loud hearty man, with a peculiar wild-beast toothy grin, and an explosive habit of slapping his hand down for emphasis. i jotted down a few of his _obiter dicta_ after our conversation. he had no good word for henry james. “he is not a whole man. all that subtlety is really decadence.” he was very virile, not to say heroic in his views. “a man should guard particularly against being led from his duty, especially a dangerous duty, by his women. i guess a woman would have had a bad time if she had tried to lead leonidas from the pass.” of the german emperor he said that he was jealous of the king’s dog at the king’s funeral because he attracted the more notice. altogether he was one of the raciest talkers i have ever met. among the occasional great ones of earth whom i have met there is hardly anyone who stands out more clearly than arthur balfour, with his willowy figure, his gentle intellectual face, and, as i read it, his soul of steel. i should think that of all men of our day he was the last who would be turned from any path which he had deliberately taken, but, on the other hand, he was capable of standing a most unconscionable time at the place where paths divide, for his mind was so subtle and active that he would always see the two sides of every question and waver between them. he could never have been a pioneer. the occasion of our first meeting was a most ridiculous one. old lord burnham, the first of his line, had invited me down to his country house at beaconsfield--a wonderful house which had been built originally by waller, the royalist poet. burke had lived close by, and the dagger which, in a melodramatic moment, he threw upon the floor of the house, in order to show the dangers of french republican propaganda, is still on exhibition. i can remember the party well, though nearly all of them are now on the farther side. i see lady dorothy nevill with her mittened hands and her prim pussy-cat manner, retailing gossip about disraeli’s flirtations. sir henry james walks under the trees with bended head, talking to the rising barrister who is destined as lord reading to be viceroy of india. lady cleveland, mother of lord rosebery, is listening with her old face wreathed in smiles to lady dorothy’s scandal. young harry irving looks unutterably bored as lord burnham explains golf to him, bending his head over to get a glimpse of the ball round the curve of his goodly waistcoat. mr. asquith stands smiling beside them. as one looks back they seem all to have been shadows in a world of shadow. lord burnham’s hobby was turkish baths, and he had an excellent one in the front of the house, the drying room being the first door on the right as one entered, and being a simple sitting-room as far as appearance went. with his usual kind hospitality lord burnham had urged me to try his bath, and having done so i was placed, arrayed in a long towel, and with another towel screwed round my head, in the drying room. presently the door opened, and entered arthur balfour, prime minister of england. he knew nothing of the house or its ways, and i can remember the amazement with which he gazed at me. lord burnham following at his heels introduced me, and i raised the towel on my head. there were no explanations, and i felt that he went away with the impression that this was my usual costume. i did not see him after that week-end--he kept his room, i remember, until midday on the sunday--until some years later when, after heavy domestic loss, i was endeavouring to collect myself again in a little inn near dunbar. he heard of my presence, and in his kindness sent a car over from whittinghame, only a few miles away, with a request that i should come over for a couple of days. there was present his brother, gerald balfour, a man with a beautifully refined face and manner, not unlike that of andrew lang. his wife is the famous lady betty balfour, the daughter of lord lytton. when one thinks of that group of inter-allied families--the balfours, cecils, sedgwicks, and lyttons--it seems a sort of nerve ganglion of british life. there was also lady frances balfour, who was a daughter of the duke of argyle, and not unlike him, as i can remember him. her husband was arthur balfour’s brother, an architect and antiquary, while another brother was colonel of the london scottish. finally, there was miss alice balfour, a very sweet and gentle intellectual person, who was my actual hostess. i found arthur balfour in great spirits because he had just won a golf medal at north berwick. he seemed as pleased as any schoolboy, and his sister told me that no political success ever gave him the keen pleasure which he had from his golf victory. he was an average player, orthodox in style, and about 10 or 12 in handicap. he proved to be a charming host, for he was a good listener, seeming to be really eager to hear your opinion, laughed heartily at small provocation, and talked always very frankly and modestly of himself. after my long solitude i was more loquacious, i remember, than is my way, but he bore it with good humour. every night--or at least on the sunday night--the whole staff of the large rambling establishment, maids and grooms, some twenty in all, came in for prayers, which were read by the head of the house. it was fine to hear groom and statesman praying humbly together that they be forgiven the sins of the day, and merging all earthly distinctions in the presence of that which is above us all. he was very interesting when he spoke of the outrage which the russian fleet had committed when, on their way to japan, they opened fire at the british trawlers on the dogger bank. it was curious to hear his gentle voice and to note his listless impersonal manner while he spoke in this fashion: “i was very angry, really very angry about that affair. if our fleet had been at home i should have been inclined to have stopped them in the straits. of course, one would not do that unless one had overpowering force, so as to avoid bloodshed and save the russian face. their ambassador called that morning and gave complete assurances, or really i should have had to do something. he got himself into trouble with his own government, who felt that he had given away their case.” i asked him how cabinet councils were worked. he said that they voted upon points and went by majorities, unless it was a vital thing, when of course the dissenters must resign. i observed in his character a very great horror of cowardice. nothing seemed to arouse such scorn in him. he grew quite red, i remember, as he spoke of lord george sackville, and recalled that though he had been broken and should have been shot at the battle of minden in 1759, he was none the less minister of war during the american campaign. he was also, as i reminded him, a most debauched man; and the murder of his mistress, miss reay, the actress, by her true lover, the clergyman hackman, was one of the _causes célèbres_ of that century. i shall always carry away the memory of that visit--a bright gleam in a dark passage of life. i see very clearly the old house, the huge broken tree outside, inside which a state conspiracy was once hatched, the fine library with its wealth of french memoirs, and above all the remarkable man who stood for so much in the life of the country. i was not at that time so convinced of the primary importance of psychic things as i became later, and i regret it, as this would have been my one opportunity to explore a knowledge which at that time was certainly greater than my own. years later, when the fight was heavy upon me, and when i was almost alone in the polemical arena, i wrote to mr. balfour, and charged him with sharing all my convictions and yet leaving me to defend them single-handed. his answer was: “surely my opinions upon this subject are already sufficiently well known,” which is surely an admission that i was right in my description of them, and yet was not much of a prop to me in my time of need. i cast my mind back to other statesmen whom i have known, and mr. asquith’s kindly personality comes into my memory. i remember playing a round of golf with him once--and a very bad player he was--but his conversation as we went round was plus four. he was a naturally sweet-natured man, but under that gentleness there lay judgment and firmness, as was shown at the great crisis of history. he never said too much, but what he did say he lived up to. in conducting us safely through those first two years of war he did that for which he has never had sufficient credit, and the more light we have had since, the more clear it has been that lord kitchener and he were really doing all that men could do, in munition work and all other ways. because he had the solid yorkshire stolidity, more nervous and excitable people thought that he did not take the war sufficiently seriously, while the constant lies about the pro-german tendencies of his wife increased the evil impression. we owe him a reparation which is second only to that which is due to lord haldane. and that is indeed a heavy one. if one man could be named who was absolutely indispensable to victory it was haldane. he it was who built up the whole splendid weapon which flashed so swiftly from its sheath, and which germany was so amazed to find directed at its breast as it rushed forward upon its furious course. he could not work miracles; he could not introduce conscription when a candidate with such a programme would have been chased from the hustings; he could not prepare the public mind in some dramatic way which would have precipitated the very crash which there was still some chance of avoiding. but all we had he gave us--the eight divisions which saved france, the territorials who carried on the good work until the new armies were ready and the officers’ training corps, which strengthened us where we should have been fatally weak. there has never been so foolish and ungrateful a clamour as that which has been raised against haldane. i remember that when he took the chair for me in the first war lecture which i gave in london there were cries of “traitor!” from people, chiefly women, among the audience. i had never seen haldane before, and have never seen him since, so i have no personal bias in the matter, but i am proud that it was in my first volume of the “history of the war,” published in 1915, that i first put forward the unpopular view which will now be more fully accepted. with george meredith i had several interesting connections. i have the greatest possible admiration for him at his best, while his worst is such a handicap that i think it will drag four-fifths of his work to oblivion. if his own generation finds him hard to understand, what will our descendants make of him? he will be a cult among a few--a precious few in every sense. and yet i fully recognize that his was the most active original brain and the most clever pen of any man, novelist or otherwise, of my time. knowing this well, it is strange that i can see so limited a future for him. his subtle and intricate mind seemed unable to realize the position of the plain outsiders who represent the world. he could not see how his stained-glass might be less effective than the plain transparent substance as a medium for vision. the first requisite is to be intelligible. the second is to be interesting. the third is to be clever. meredith enormously filled the third, but he was unequal upon the other two. hence he will never, in spite of the glories of “richard feverel” be on an equality with dickens or thackeray, who filled all three. he had simply no idea how his words would strike a less complex mind. i remember that once in the presence of barrie, quiller-couch and myself, he read out a poem which he had inscribed “to the british working-man” in the “westminster gazette.” i don’t know what the british working-man made of it, but i am sure that we three were greatly puzzled as to what it was about. i had written some articles on his work, which had been one of my youthful cults, and that led to his inviting me to see him at his villa at box hill--the first of several such visits. there had been a good deal in the papers about his health, so that i was surprised when, as i opened the garden gate, a slight but robust gentleman in a grey suit and a red tie swung out of the hall door and came singing loudly down the path. i suppose he was getting on to seventy at the time but he looked younger, and his artistic face was good to the eye. greeting me he pointed to a long steep hill behind the house and said: “i have just been up to the top for a walk.” i looked at the sharp slope and said: “you must be in good trim to do it.” he looked angry and said: “that would be a proper compliment to pay to an octogenarian.” i was a little nettled by his touchiness, so i answered: “i understood that i was talking to an invalid.” it really seemed as if my visit would terminate at the garden gate, but presently he relented, and we soon became quite friendly. he had in his youth been a judge of wine, and had still a reverence for a good vintage, but unfortunately some nervous complaint from which he suffered had caused the doctors to prohibit it absolutely. when lunch came round he asked me with a very earnest air whether i could undertake to drink a whole bottle of burgundy. i answered that i saw no insuperable difficulty. a dusty old bottle was tenderly carried up, which i disposed of, meredith taking a friendly interest in its dispatch. “the fact is,” said he, “i love my wine, and my little cellar was laid down with care and judgment, so that when some guest comes and drinks a glass and wastes the rest of the bottle it goes to my heart. it really did me good to see you enjoy that one.” i need not say that i intimated that i was always prepared to oblige. his conversation was extraordinarily vivid and dramatic, uttered in a most vehement tone. it may have been artificial, and it may have been acting, but it was very arresting and entertaining. the talk got upon napoleon’s marshals, and you would have thought that he knew them intimately, and he did murat’s indignation at being told to charge _au bout_, as if he ever charged any other way, in a fashion which would have brought down the house. every now and then he brought out a meredithian sentence which sounded comic when applied to domestic matters. when the jelly swayed about as the maid put it on the table he said: “the jelly, mary, is as treacherous as the trojan horse.” he laughed when i told him how my groom, enlisted as a waiter for some special dinner, said, “huddup, there,” to the jelly under similar circumstances. after lunch we walked up a steep path to the little chalet or summerhouse where he used to write. he wished to read me a novel which he had begun twenty years before, but which he had not had the heart to go on with. i liked it greatly--and we roared with laughter at his description of an old sea-dog who turned up the collar of his coat when he went into action as if the bullets were rain. he said that my hearty enjoyment encouraged him to go on with it, and it has since appeared as the “amazing marriage,” but whether i really had anything to do with it i do not know. i should be proud to think so. the nervous complaint from which he suffered caused him to fall down occasionally. as we walked up the narrow path to the chalet i heard him fall behind me, but judged from the sound that it was a mere slither and could not have hurt him. therefore i walked on as if i had heard nothing. he was a fiercely proud old man, and my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up would be far greater than any relief i could give him. it was certainly a nice point to decide. george meredith’s religious convictions were very difficult to decide. he certainly had no glimmering so far as i could see of any psychic element in life, and i should imagine that on the whole he shared the opinions of his friend, john morley, which were completely negative. and yet i remember his assuring me that prayer was a very necessary thing, and that one should never abandon prayer. “who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is granted,” says the aphorist in “richard feverel.” how far these positions can be harmonized i do not know. i suppose that one may say that god is unknown, and yet rear a mental temple to the unknown god. rudyard kipling i know far less than i should, considering how deeply i admire his writings, and that we live in the same country; but we are both absorbed in work, and both much away from home, which may explain it. i can well remember how eagerly i bought his first book, “plain tales,” in the old southsea days, when buying a book was a rare strain upon my exchequer. i read it with delight, and realized not only that a new force had arisen in literature, but that a new method of story writing had appeared which was very different from my own adherence to the careful plot artfully developed. this was go-as-you-please take-it-or-leave-it work, which glowed suddenly up into an incandescent phrase or paragraph, which was the more effective for its sudden advent. in form his stories were crude, and yet in effect--which, after all, is everything--they were superb. it showed me that methods could not be stereotyped, and that there was a more excellent way, even if it were beyond my reach. i loved the “barrack room ballads” also, and such poems as “the bolivar,” “east and west,” and above all the badly named “l’envoi” became part of my very self. i always read the last one aloud to my little circle before we start on any fresh expedition, because it contains the very essence of travel, romance, and high adventure. i saw kipling most nearly in his very early days when he lived at brattleboro, a little village in vermont, in a chivalrous desire to keep his newly married wife in touch with her own circle. in 1894, as i have recorded, there was a good deal of tail-twisting going on in the states, and kipling pulled a few feathers out of the eagle’s tail in retaliation, which caused many screams of protest, for the american was far more sensitive to such things than the case-hardened briton. i say “was,” for i think as a nation with an increased assurance of their own worth and strength they are now more careless of criticism. the result at the time was to add oil to flames, and i, as a passionate believer in anglo-american union, wrote to kipling to remonstrate. he received my protest very good-humouredly, and it led to my visit to his country home. as a matter of fact, the concern shown in america, when the poet lay at death’s door a few years later, showed that the rancour was not very deep. perhaps he was better known at that time in america than in england, for i remember sitting beside a bushman in london, who bowed his red face to my ear and said: “beg your pardon, sir, but ’oo is this ’ere kilpin?” i had two great days in vermont, and have a grateful remembrance of mrs. kipling’s hospitality. the poet read me “mcandrew’s hymn,” which he had just done, and surprised me by his dramatic power which enabled him to sustain the glasgow accent throughout, so that the angular scottish greaser simply walked the room. i had brought up my golf clubs and gave him lessons in a field while the new england rustics watched us from afar, wondering what on earth we were at, for golf was unknown in america at that time. we parted good friends, and the visit was an oasis in my rather dreary pilgrimage as a lecturer. my glimpses of kipling since then have been few and scattered, but i had the pleasure several times of meeting his old father, a most delightful and lovable person, who told a story quite as well as his famous son. as the mother was also a very remarkable woman, it is no wonder that he carried such a cargo. james barrie is one of my oldest literary friends, and i knew him within a year or two of the time when we both came to london. he had just written his “window in thrums,” and i, like all the world, acclaimed it. when i was lecturing in scotland in 1893 he invited me to kirriemuir, when i stayed some days with his family--splendid types of the folk who have made scotland great. his father was a fine fellow, but his mother was wonderful with a head and a heart--rare combinations--which made me class her with my own mother. kirriemuir could by no means understand barrie’s success, and looked upon their great son as an inexplicable phenomenon. they were acutely aware, however, that tourists were arriving from all parts to see the place on account of barrie’s books. “i suppose you have read them,” i said to the wife of the local hotel man. “aye, i’ve read them, and steep, steep, weary work it was,” said she. she had some theory that it was a four-horse coach which her good man was running, and not the books at all which accounted for the boom. great as are barrie’s plays--and some of them i think are very great--i wish he had never written a line for the theatre. the glamour of it and the--to him--easy success have diverted from literature the man with the purest style of his age. plays are always ephemeral, however good, and are limited to a few, but barrie’s unborn books might have been an eternal and a universal asset of british literature. he has the chaste clarity which is the great style, which has been debased by a generation of wretched critics who have always confused what is clear with what is shallow, and what is turbid with what is profound. if a man’s thought is precise, his rendering of it is precise, and muddy thoughts make obscure paragraphs. if i had to make my choice among modern stylists, i should pick barrie for the lighter forms of expression and our british winston churchill for the more classical. barrie’s great play--one of the finest in the language--is of course “the admirable crichton.” i shall always hope that i had a hand in the fashioning of it. i say this not in complaint but in satisfaction, for we all drop seeds into each other, and seldom know whence they come. we were walking together on the heath at kirriemuir when i said: “i had a quaint thought in the night, barrie. it was that a king was visiting india and was wrecked on the way on some island far from the track of ships. only he and one rather handy sailor were saved. they settled down to spend their lives together. of course the result would be that the sailor would become the king and the king the subject.” we chuckled over the idea, and when crichton appeared, i seemed to see the fine plant which had grown from the tiny seed. barrie and i had one unfortunate venture together, in which i may say that the misfortune was chiefly mine, since i had really nothing to do with the matter, and yet shared all the trouble. however, i should have shared the honour and profit in case of success, so that i have no right to grumble. the facts were that barrie had promised mr. d’oyley carte that he would provide the libretto of a light opera for the savoy. this was in the gilbert days, when such a libretto was judged by a very high standard. it was an extraordinary commission for him to accept, and i have never yet been able to understand why he did so, unless, like alexander, he wanted fresh worlds to conquer. on this occasion, however, he met with a disastrous repulse, and the opera, “jane annie,” to which i alluded in an early chapter, was one of the few failures in his brilliant career. i was brought into the matter because barrie’s health failed on account of some family bereavement. i had an urgent telegram from him at aldburgh, and going there i found him very worried because he had bound himself by this contract, and he felt in his present state unable to go forward with it. there were to be two acts, and he had written the first one, and had the rough scenario of the second, with the complete sequence of events--if one may call it a sequence. would i come in with him and help him to complete it as part author? of course i was very happy to serve him in any way. my heart sank, however, when, after giving the promise, i examined the work. the only literary gift which barrie has not got is the sense of poetic rhythm, and the instinct for what is permissible in verse. ideas and wit were in abundance. but the plot itself was not strong though the dialogue and the situations also were occasionally excellent. i did my best and wrote the lyrics for the second act, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the predestined shape. the result was not good. however, the actual comradeship of production was very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly painful to us because it let down the producer and the cast. we were well abused by the critics, but barrie took it all in the bravest spirit. i find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from barrie which is good reading. in account with j. m. barrie. _why._ _cause of delay._ _remarks._ a £1 lent at station. object moving too fast. doyle _says_ he lent it. b £12 jane annie moving or swaying better late than on tour. of kodak. never. c £30 6_s._ 4_d._ failure to pull cord. doyle gets 2/5 of heaven knows. a penny beyond his share. our associations were never so closely renewed, but through all my changing life i have had a respect and affection for barrie which were, i hope, mutual. how i collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is told in my chapter on sport. henry irving is one of the other great men whom i have met at close quarters, for his acting of gregory brewster brought us in contact. when he was producing “coriolanus” he came down to hindhead and used to drop in of an evening. he was fond of a glass of port--indeed, he was one of the four great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the hon. g. russell to drink a bottle each night--being the only trait which these great men had in common. the others, i remember, were tennyson, gladstone and moses montefiori, and the last i believe was really true. like all bad habits, it overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off at the age of 116. irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and ill-natured. i can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion for heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. the unexpectedness of his remarks took one aback. i remember when my friend hamilton sat up with me into the “wee sma’ hours” with the famous man, he became rather didactic on the subject of the deity or the universe or some other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at great length. irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker’s face, which encouraged hamilton to go on and on. when at last he had finished, irving remarked: “_what_ a low comedian you would have made!” he wound up his visit by giving me his copy of “coriolanus” with all his notes and stage directions--a very precious relic. many visions of old times rise before my eyes as i write, but my book would lose all proportion should i dwell upon them. i see henley, the formidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who could only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. he was a great poet and critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of marlowe of the mighty line and the pothouse fray. i see haggard too, first as the young spruce diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange vague tendencies to mysticism. shaw, too, i see with the pleasant silky voice and the biting phrase. it was strange that all the mild vegetables which formed his diet made him more pugnacious and, i must add, more uncharitable than the carnivorous man, so that i have known no literary man who was more ruthless to other people’s feelings. and yet to meet him was always to like him. he could not resist a bitter jest or the perverted pleasure of taking up an unpopular attitude. as an example i remember henry irving telling me that when shaw was invited to his father’s funeral he wrote in reply: “if i were at westminster henry irving would turn in his grave, just as shakespeare would turn in his grave were henry irving at stratford.” i may not have it verbally exact, but that was near enough. it was the kind of outrageous thing that he would say. and yet one can forgive him all when one reads the glorious dialogue of some of his plays. he seems subhuman in emotion and superhuman in intellect. shaw was always a thorn in irving’s side, and was usually the one jarring note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh production. at a first night at the lyceum--those wonderful first nights which have never been equalled--the lanky irishman with his greenish face, his red beard, and his sardonic expression must have been like the death’s-head at the banquet to irving. irving ascribed this animosity to shaw’s pique because his plays were not accepted, but in this i am sure that he did an injustice. it was simply that contrary twist in the man which makes him delight in opposing whatever anyone else approved. there is nothing constructive in him, and he is bound to be in perpetual opposition. no one for example was stronger for peace and for non-militarism than he, and i remember that when i took the chair at a meeting at hindhead to back up the tsar’s peace proposals at the hague, i thought to myself as i spied shaw in a corner of the room: “well, this time at any rate he must be in sympathy.” but far from being so he sprang to his feet and put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these proposals for peace would be disastrous. do what you could he was always against you. perhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continually stated, and the british stand that sort of thing better than other nations. had shaw said in america what he said in england about the war whilst it was in progress he would have been in personal danger. there were times, however, when his queer contrary impulses became perfectly brutal in their working. one was at the time of the _titanic_ disaster, when he deliberately wrote a letter at a time when the wounds were raw, overwhelming every one concerned with bitter criticism. i was moved to write a remonstrance, and we had a sharp debate in public, which did not in any way modify our kindly personal relations. i can recall a smaller but even more unjustifiable example of his sour nature when he was staying at hindhead. a garden-party had been got up for some charity, and it included the woodland scenes of “as you like it,” which were done by amateurs, and very well done too. shaw with no provocation wrote a whole column of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors and their performance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though indeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. one mentions these things as characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, i fear, that the adoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts or actions to an end. but with it all shaw is a genial creature to meet, and i am prepared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature though it has not been presented to the public. it took a good man to write “saint joan.” wells, too, i have known long, and indeed i must have often entered the draper’s shop in which he was employed at southsea, for the proprietor was a patient of mine. wells is one of the great fruits which popular education has given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the heart of the people. his democratic frankness and complete absence of class feeling are occasionally embarrassing. i remember his asking me once if i had played cricket at liphook. i said that i had. he said: “did you notice an old fellow who acts as professional and ground-keeper?” i said that i had. “that was my father,” said wells. i was too much surprised to answer, and could only congratulate myself that i had made no unpleasant comments before i knew the identity of the old man. i have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the future in which wells indulges. he has, it is true, made a couple of good shots which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine which would deliver news in our own houses. but he has never shown any perception of the true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his history of the world, elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to be a body without a soul. however, this also may be given him, and it will make his equipment complete. i remember discussing the matter with him, when george gissing, hornung, he and i foregathered in rome early in this century, but apparently my words had no effect. willie hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memories. he was a dr. johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. no one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain. these things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat in the telling, but i remember how, when i showed him the record of some one who claimed to have done 100 yards under ten seconds, he said: “it is a sprinter’s error.” golf he could not abide, for he said it was “unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting ball.” his criticism upon my sherlock holmes was: “though he might be more humble, there is no police like holmes.” i think i may claim that his famous character raffles was a kind of inversion of sherlock holmes, bunny playing watson. he admits as much in his kindly dedication. i think there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though i confess i think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. i told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, i fear, borne me out. you must not make the criminal a hero. jerome, too, is an old friend. he is an adventurous soul, and at one time started a four-in-hand. i remember sitting on the top of it, and when one of the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the driver i thought it was time to get down. maxwell also is an old friend. he is, of course, the son of miss braddon, who married a publisher of that name. i respect him for doing a man’s work in the war when, though he was fifty years of age, and had led a sedentary life, he volunteered for a fighting battalion, a credit which he shares with a. e. w. mason. maxwell’s work has always greatly appealed to me, and i have long looked upon him as the greatest novelist that we possess. i never met robert louis stevenson in the flesh, though i owe so much to him in the literary spirit. never can i forget the delight with which i read those early stories of his in the “cornhill,” before i knew the name of the author. i still think that “the pavilion on the links” is one of the great short stories of the world, though there were alterations in the final form which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon the part of the publishers. stevenson’s last year at edinburgh university must have just about coincided with my first one, and barrie must also have been in that grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. strange to think that i probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded portal. from his far-away home in samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye upon literary matters in england, and i had most encouraging letters from him in 1893 and 1894. “o frolic fellow-spookist” was his curious term of personal salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared my interest in psychic research but did not take it very seriously. i cannot guess how at that time he had detected it, though i was aware that he had himself in early days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to a spiritualist society in edinburgh, which studied the remarkable mediumship of duguid. his letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of my work. “i have a great talent for compliment,” he said, “accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic, frankness.” he had been retailing some of my sherlock holmes yarns to his native servants--i should not have thought that he needed to draw upon anyone else--and he complained to me in a comical letter of the difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt every moment to explain what a railway was, what an engineer was, and so forth. he got the story across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, “if you could have seen the bright feverish eyes of simite you would have tasted glory.” but he explained that the natives took everything literally, and that there was no such thing as an imaginary story for them. “i, who write this, have had the indiscretion to perpetuate a trifling piece of fiction, ‘the bottle imp.’ parties who come up to visit my mansion, after having admired the ceiling by vanderputty and the tapestry by gobbling, manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. they may be seen to shrug a brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the secret bursts from them: ‘where is the bottle?’” in another letter he said that as i had written of my first book in the “idler” he also would do so. “i could not hold back where the white plume of conan doyle waved in front of me.” so, at least, i may boast that it is to me that the world owes the little personal sketch about “treasure island” which appeared in that year. i cannot forget the shock that it was to me when driving down the strand in a hansom cab in 1896 i saw upon a yellow evening poster “death of stevenson.” something seemed to have passed out of my world. i was asked by his executors to finish the novel “st. ives,” which he had left three-quarters completed, but i did not feel equal to the task. it was done, however, and, i understand, very well done, by quiller-couch. it is a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man’s story, and must be a more or less mechanical effort. i had one experience of it when my neighbour at hindhead, grant allen, was on his death-bed. he was much worried because there were two numbers of his serial, “hilda wade,” which was running in “the strand” magazine, still uncompleted. it was a pleasure for me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and i expect they were pretty bad. some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her hilda wade. he was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight. i well remember that death-bed of grant allen’s. he was an agnostic of a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and benevolent man. believing what he did, the approach of death must have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. i had often argued the case with him, i from a theistic and he from a negative point of view, but i did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. his brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. i can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the sheet, while he croaked out: “byzantine art, my dear doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the roman empire. the characteristics of the first period----” and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his lecture. his dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. one thinks, as a contrast, of dr. hodgson’s impatient cry, “i can hardly wait for death!” grant allen’s strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which was gentle and benignant. i remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which we gave in the character of a cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. he used to tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband: “remember, john, if he openly blasphemes, i leave the room.” he had, i remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in their employer’s scientific experiments. on one occasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: “oh, sir, araminta has got a wasp.” araminta was the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time. grant allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. on the other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with samuel laing. his only real success in fiction was the excellent short story “john creedy,” where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results. at the time when i and so many others turned to letters there was certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. the giants of old had all departed. thackeray, dickens, charles reade and trollope were memories. there was no great figure remaining save hardy. the rising novelist was mrs. humphry ward, who was just beginning her career with “robert elsmere,” the first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. i think it was hodgkin who said, when he read “count robert of paris”: “here have i been studying byzantium all my life, and i never understood it until this blessed scotch lawyer came along.” that is the special prerogative of imagination. trollope and mrs. ward have the whole victorian civilization dissected and preserved. then there were meredith, unintelligible to most, and walter besant. there was wilkie collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there was james payn. payn was much greater than his books. the latter were usually rather mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his “literary reminiscences,” and especially his “backwater of life.” he had all that humorous view which nature seems to give as a compensation to those whose strength is weak. had payn written only essays he would have rivalled charles lamb. i knew him best in his latter days, when he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. he was intensely pessimistic as to his own fate. “don’t make any mistake, doyle, death is a horrible thing--horrible! i suffer the agonies of the damned!” but five minutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high treble laugh would be the loudest of all. his own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. i remember how he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in bournemouth and how they carried him home on a litter. he was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which he passed. “i thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in the matter of plumes.” when he told a story he was so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. an american had called upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon assyrian tablets. “i thought they were something to eat,” he screamed. he was an excellent whist player, and the baldwin club used to send three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his game. this game was very scientific. he would tell with delight how he asked some novice: “do you play the penultimate?” to which the novice answered: “no--but my brother plays the american organ.” many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a human and kindly critic. his writing however, was really dreadful. it was of him that the story was told that an author handed one of his letters to a chemist for a test. the chemist retired for a time and then returned with a bottle and demanded half a crown. better luck attended the man who received an illegible letter from a railway director. he used it as a free pass upon the line. payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one’s story. there was one letter in which i could only read the words “infringement of copyright.” he was very funny when he described the work of the robust younger school. “i have received a story from ----” he said, “5,000 words, mostly damns.” i knew sir henry thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. they always seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple viands. possibly, however, like meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from the enjoyment of others. he had been a wonderful _viveur_ and judge of what was what, and i fear that i disappointed him, for i was much more interested in the conversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a westphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. but it was part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was set before them. i have never heard more interesting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. few men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room. there was one special dinner, i fancy it was the hundredth of the series, which was particularly interesting as the prince of wales, now george v, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round the world from which he had just returned. of the rest of the company i can only recall sir henry stanley, the traveller, and sir crichton browne. twenty years later i met the king when he visited a trade exhibition, and i attended as one of the directors of tuck’s famous postcard firm. he at once said: “why, i have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me at sir henry thompson’s.” it seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory. i have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. my life has been too busy and too pre-occupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten path. the mention of the prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when i was privileged to entertain--or to attempt to entertain--the present queen. it was at a small dinner to which i was invited by the courtesy of lord midleton whose charming wife, once madeleine stanley, daughter of lady helier, i could remember since her girlhood. upon this occasion the prince and princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to her. i was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. i confess that i found it heavy going at first, for i had heard somewhere that royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that i should not have known where to begin. however she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about my works which brought me on to very easy ground. indeed, i became so interested in our talk that i was quite disappointed when mr. john morley was led up, and i realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair. there was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. i had been asked to take in lady curzon, whose husband, then viceroy of india, had been unable to attend. the first couple had passed in and there was a moment’s hesitation as to who should go next, but lady curzon and i were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed through. i thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. “do you know,” he said, “that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling in british society.” “the lord chancellor and the college of heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. there has never been so vexed a question as to whether a vice-reine when she is away from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a duchess. there was a duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for ever.” so who shall say that i have done nothing in my life? of the distinguished lights of the law whom i have met from time to time i think that sir henry hawkins--then become lord bampton--made the most definite impression. i met him at a week-end gathering at cliveden, when mr. astor was our host. on the first night at dinner, before the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. his appearance was so jovial that i remarked to the lady upon my left: “it is curious to notice the appearance of our _vis-à-vis_ and to contrast it with his reputation,” alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. she seemed rather puzzled by my remark, so i added: “of course you know who he is.” “yes,” said she, “his name is conan doyle and he writes novels.” i was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that i was amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list of guests. i put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other. hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never knew whether one was dealing with jekyll or with hyde. it was certainly hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the penge case, and did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. sir edward clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice when hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. so they were dropped. i might, on the other hand, illustrate the jekyll side of him by a story which he told me with his own lips. a prisoner had a pet mouse. one day the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. the prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the law equally clear. what was he to do? in his charge to the jury he said: “if a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. if, for example, a man in london discharged a pistol to hurt a man in edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. so also when a man stabs an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.” the jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought in a verdict of “not guilty.” another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon my mind was sir francis jeune, afterwards lord st. helier. i attended several of lady jeune’s famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the outstanding institutions of london, like gladstone’s breakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. i am indebted to this lady for very many kind actions. her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. he told me that if every copy of horace were destroyed he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. he presided over the divorce courts, and i remember upon one occasion i said to him: “you must have a very low opinion of human nature, sir francis, since the worst side of it is for ever presented towards you.” “on the contrary,” said he very earnestly, “my experience in the divorce courts has greatly raised my opinion of humanity. there is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business that it is extremely edifying.” this view seemed to me to be worth recording. chapter xxiv some recollections of sport racing--shooting--a fish story--boxing--past and present--carpentier and france--the reno fight--football--golf with the sirdar--billiards--cricket--w. g. grace--queer experiences--tragic matches--humiliation--success in holland--barrie’s team--a precedent--motor accidents--prince henry tour--aviation--the balloon and the aeroplane--ski--over a precipice--rifle shooting. it is here--before we approach what maxwell has called “the great interruption”--that i may perhaps break my narrative in order to interpolate a chapter upon the general subject of my experiences of sport, which have taken up an appreciable part of my life, added greatly to its pleasure, and which can be better treated as a whole than recounted seriatim. it may best be fitted in at this spot as my sporting life one way and another may be said to have reached its modest zenith about that time. as one grows old one looks back at one’s career in sport as a thing completed. yet i have at least held on to it as long as i could, for i played a hard match of association football at forty-four, and i played cricket for ten years more. i have never specialized, and have therefore been a second-rater in all things. i have made up for it by being an all-rounder, and have had, i dare say, as much fun out of sport as many an adept. it would be odd if a man could try as many games as i for so many years without having some interesting experiences or forming a few opinions which would bear recording and discussion. and first of all let me “damn the sins i have no mind to” by recording what most of my friends will regard as limitation. i never could look upon flat-racing as a true sport. sport is what a man does, not what a horse does. skill and judgment are shown, no doubt, by the professional jockeys, but i think it may be argued that in nine cases out of ten the best horse wins, and would have equally won, could his head be kept straight, had there been a dummy on his back. but making every allowance on the one side, for what human qualities may be called forth, and for any improvement of the breed of horses (though i am told that the same pains in other directions would produce infinitely more fruitful and generally useful results), and putting on the other side the demoralization from betting, the rascality among some book-makers, and the collection of undesirable characters brought together by a race meeting, i cannot avoid the conclusion that the harm greatly outweighs the good from a broadly national point of view. yet i recognize, of course, that it is an amusement which lies so deeply in human nature--the oldest, perhaps, of all amusements which have come down to us--that it must have its place in our system until the time may come when it will be gradually modified, developing, perhaps, some purifying change, as prize-fighting did when it turned to contests with the gloves. i have purposely said “flat-racing,” because i think a stronger case, though not, perhaps, an entirely sound one, could be made out for steeplechasing. eliminate the mob and the money, and then, surely, among feats of human skill and hardihood there are not many to match that of the winner of a really stiff point-to-point, while the man who rides at the huge barriers of the grand national has a heart for anything. as in the old days of the ring, it is not the men nor the sport, but it is the followers who cast a shadow on the business. go down to waterloo and meet any returning race train, if you doubt it. if i have alienated half my readers by my critical attitude to the turf, i shall probably offend the other half by stating that i cannot persuade myself that we are justified in taking life as a pleasure. to shoot for the pot must be right, since man must feed, and to kill creatures which live upon others (the hunting of foxes, for example) must also be right, since to slay one is to save many; but the rearing of birds in order to kill them, and the shooting of such sensitive and inoffensive animals as hares and deer, cannot, i think, be justified. i must admit that i shot a good deal before i came to this conclusion. perhaps the fact, while it prevents my assuming any airs of virtue, will give my opinion greater weight, since good shooting is still within my reach, and i know nothing more exhilarating than to wait on the borders of an autumn-tinted wood, to hear the crackling advance of beaters, to mark the sudden whirr and the yell of “mark over,” and then, over the topmost branches, to see a noble cock pheasant whizzing down wind at a pace which pitches him a 100 yards behind you when you have dropped him. but when your moment of exultation is over, and you note what a beautiful creature he is and how one instant of your pleasure has wrecked him, you feel that you had better think no longer if you mean to slip two more cartridges into your gun and stand by for another. worse still is it when you hear the child-like wail of the wounded hare. i should think that there are few sportsmen who have not felt a disgust at their own handiwork when they have heard it. so, too, when you see the pheasant fly on with his legs showing beneath him as sign that he is hard hit. he drops into the thick woods and is lost to sight. perhaps it is as well for your peace of mind that he should be lost to thought also. of course, one is met always by the perfectly valid argument that the creatures would not live at all if it were not for the purposes of sport, and that it is presumably better from their point of view that they should eventually meet a violent death than that they should never have existed. no doubt this is true. but there is another side of the question as to the effect of the sport upon ourselves--whether it does not blunt our own better feelings, harden our sympathies, brutalize our natures. a coward can do it as well as a brave man; a weakling can do it as well as a strong man. there is no ultimate good from it. have we a moral right then, to kill creatures for amusement? i know many of the best and most kind-hearted men who do it, but still i feel that in a more advanced age it will no longer be possible. and yet i am aware of my own inconsistency when i say i am in sympathy with fishing, and would gladly have a little if i knew where to get it. and yet, is it wholly inconsistent? is a cold-blooded creature of low organization like a fish to be regarded in the same way as the hare which cries out in front of the beagles, or the deer which may carry the rifle bullet away in its side? if there is any cruelty it is surely of a much less degree. besides, is it not the sweet solitude of nature, the romantic quest, rather than the actual capture which appeals to the fisherman? one thinks of the stories of trout and salmon which have taken another fly within a few minutes of having broken away from a former one, and one feels that their sense of pain must be very different from our own. i once had the best of an exchange of fishing stories, which does not sound like a testimonial to my veracity. it was in a birmingham inn, and a commercial traveller was boasting of his success. i ventured to back the weight of the last three fish which i had been concerned in catching against any day’s take of his life-time. he closed with the bet and quoted some large haul, 100 lbs. or more. “now, sir,” he asked triumphantly, “what was the weight of your three fish?” “just over 200 tons,” i answered. “whales?” “yes, three greenland whales.” “i give you best,” he cried; but whether as a fisherman, or as a teller of fish stories, i am not sure. as a matter of fact, i had only returned that year from the arctic seas, and the three fish in question were, in truth, the last which i had helped to catch. my experiences during my arctic voyage both with whales and bears i have already touched upon, so i will not refer to them again, though it was the greatest period of sport which has ever come my way. i have always been keen upon the noble old english sport of boxing, and, though of no particular class myself, i suppose i might describe my form as that of a fair average amateur. i should have been a better man had i taught less and learned more, but after my first tuition i had few chances of professional teaching. however, i have done a good deal of mixed boxing among many different types of men, and had as much pleasure from it as from any form of sport. it stood me in good stead aboard the whaler. on the very first evening i had a strenuous bout with the steward, who was an excellent sportsman. i heard him afterwards, through the partition of the cabin, declare that i was “the best sur-r-r-geon we’ve had, colin--he’s blacked my ee.” it struck me as a singular test of my medical ability, but i dare say it did no harm. i remember when i was a medical practitioner going down to examine a man’s life for insurance in a little sussex village. he was the gentleman farmer of the place, and a most sporting and jovial soul. it was a saturday, and i enjoyed his hospitality that evening, staying over till monday. after breakfast it chanced that several neighbours dropped in, one of whom, an athletic young farmer, was fond of the gloves. conversation soon brought out the fact that i had a weakness in the same direction. the result was obvious. two pairs of gloves were hunted from some cupboard, and in a few minutes we were hard at it, playing light at first and letting out as we warmed. it was soon clear that there was no room inside a house for two heavy-weights, so we adjourned to the front lawn. the main road ran across the end of it, with a low wall of just the right height to allow the village to rest its elbows on it and enjoy the spectacle. we fought several very brisk rounds, with no particular advantage either way, but the contest always stands out in my memory for its queer surroundings and the old english picture in which it was set. it is one of several curious bye-battles in my career. i recollect another where another man and i, returning from a ball at five of a summer morning, went into his room and fought in our dress clothes several very vigorous rounds as a wind-up to the evening’s exercise. they say that every form of knowledge comes useful sooner or later. certainly my own experience in boxing and my very large acquaintance with the history of the prize-ring found their scope when i wrote “rodney stone.” no one but a fighting man would ever, i think, quite understand or appreciate some of the detail. a friend of mine read the scene where boy jim fights berks to a prize-fighter as he lay in what proved to be his last illness. the man listened with growing animation until the reader came to the point where the second advises boy jim, in technical jargon, how to get at his awkward antagonist. “that’s it! by god, he’s got him!” shouted the man in the bed. it was an incident which gave me pleasure when i heard it. i have never concealed my opinion that the old prize-ring was an excellent thing from a national point of view--exactly as glove-fighting is now. better that our sports should be a little too rough than that we should run a risk of effeminacy. but the ring outlasted its time. it was ruined by the villainous mobs who cared nothing for the chivalry of sport or the traditions of british fair play as compared with the money gain which the contest might bring. their blackguardism drove out the good men--the men who really did uphold the ancient standards, and so the whole institution passed into rottenness and decay. but now the glove contests carried on under the discipline of the national sporting or other clubs perpetuate the noble old sport without a possibility of the more evil elements creeping into it once more. an exhibition of hardihood without brutality, of good-humoured courage without savagery, of skill without trickery, is, i think, the very highest which sport can give. people may smile at the mittens, but a twenty-round contest with four-ounce gloves is quite as punishing an ordeal as one could wish to endure. there is as little room for a coward as in the rougher days of old, and the standard of endurance is probably as high as in the average prize-fight. one wonders how our champions of to-day would have fared at the hands of the heroes of the past. i know something of this end of the question, for i have seen nearly all the great boxers of my time, from j. l. sullivan down to tommy burns, carpentier, bombardier wells, beckett and that little miracle jimmy wilde. but how about the other end--the men of old? wonderful jem mace was the only link between them. on the one hand, he was supreme in the ’sixties as a knuckle-fighter; on the other, he gave the great impetus to glove-fighting in america, and more especially in australia, which has brought over such champions as frank slavin and fitz-simmons, who, through mace’s teaching, derive straight from the classic line of british boxers. he of all men might have drawn a just comparison between the old and the new. but even his skill and experience might be at fault, for it is notorious that many of the greatest fighters under the old régime were poor hands with the mittens. men could bang poor tom sayers all round the ring with the gloves, who would not have dared to get over the ropes had he been without them. i have seen mace box, and even when over sixty it is wonderful how straight was his left, how quick his feet, and how impregnable his guard. after the great war, one can see that those of us who worked for the revival of boxing wrought better than we knew, for at the supreme test of all time--the test which has settled the history of the future--it has played a marked part. i do not mean that a man used his fists in the war, but i mean--and every experienced instructor will, i am sure, endorse it--that the combative spirit and aggressive quickness gave us the attacking fire and helped especially in bayonet work. but it was to our allies of france that the chief advantage came. i believe that carpentier, the boxer, did more to win the war for france than any other man save the actual generals or politicians. the public proof that a frenchman could be at the very head of his class, as ledoux was also at a lighter weight, gives a physical self-respect to a nation which tinges the spirit of every single member of it. it was a great day for france when english sports, boxing, rugby football and others came across to them, and when a young man’s ideal ceased to be amatory adventure with an occasional duel. england has taught europe much, but nothing of more value than this. to return to my own small experiences of the game, i might have had one very notable one, for i was asked to referee the great contest when the champions of the white and black races fought for what may prove to be almost the last time. my first intimation was a cable followed by the following letter:-- new york, _december 9, 1909_. my dear sir,-- i hope you will pardon the liberty i took as a stranger in cabling to you asking if you would act at the championship battle between jeffries and johnson. the fact is that when the articles were signed recently your name was suggested for referee, and tex rickard, promoter of the fight, was greatly interested, as were many others. i believe it will interest you to know that the opinion was unanimous that you would do admirably in the position. in a voting contest several persons sent in your name as their choice. believe me among sporting men of the best class in america you have many strong admirers; your splendid stories of the ring, and your avowed admiration for the great sport of boxing have made you thousands of friends. it was because of this extremely friendly feeling for you in america that i took the liberty of cabling to you. i thank you for your reply. it would indeed rejoice the hearts of the men in this country if you were at the ring side when the great negro fighter meets the white man jeffries for the world’s championship. i am, my dear sir, yours sincerely, irving jefferson lewis, managing editor _new york morning telegraph_. i was much inclined to accept this honourable invitation, though my friends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor at the other. however, the distance and my engagements presented a final bar. if boxing is the finest single man sport, i think that rugby football is the best collective one. strength, courage, speed and resource are great qualities to include in a single game. i have always wished that it had come more my way in life, but my football was ruined, as many a man’s is, by the fact that at my old school they played a hybrid game peculiar to the place, with excellent points of its own, but unfitting the youngster for any other. all these local freak games, wall games, winchester games, and so on are national misfortunes, for while our youths are wasting their energies upon them--those precious early energies which make the instinctive players--the young south african or new zealander is brought up on the real universal rugby, and so comes over to pluck a few more laurel leaves out of our depleted wreath. in australia i have seen in victoria a hybrid, though excellent game of their own, but they have had the sense in other parts to fall into line, and are already taking the same high position which they hold in other branches of sport. i hope that our headmasters will follow the same course. in spite of my wretched training i played for a short time as a forward in the edinburgh university team, but my want of knowledge of the game was too heavy a handicap. afterwards i took to association, and played first goal and then back for portsmouth, when that famous club was an amateur organization. even then we could put a very fair team in the field, and were runners-up for the county cup the last season that i played. in the same season i was invited to play for the county. i was always too slow, however, to be a really good back, though i was a long and safe kick. after a long hiatus i took up football again in south africa and organized a series of inter-hospital matches in bloemfontein which helped to take our minds away from enteric. my old love treated me very scurvily, however, for i received a foul from a man’s knee which buckled two of my ribs and brought my games to a close. i have played occasionally since, but there is no doubt that as a man grows older a brisk charge shakes him up as it never did before. let him turn to golf, and be thankful that there is still one splendid game which can never desert him. there may be objections to the “royal and ancient”--but a game which takes four miles of country for the playing must always have a majesty of its own. personally i was an enthusiastic, but a very inefficient golfer--a ten at my best, and at my worst outside the pale of all decent handicaps. but surely it is a great testimony to the qualities of a game when a man can be both enthusiastic and inefficient. it is a proof at least that a man plays for the game’s sake and not for personal kudos. golf is the coquette of games. it always lures one on and always evades one. ten years ago i thought i had nearly got it. i hope so to-day. but my scoring cards will show, i fear, that the coquette has not yet been caught. the elderly lover cannot hope to win her smile. i used in my early golfing days to practise on the very rudimentary links in front of the mena hotel, just under the pyramids. it was a weird course, where, if you sliced your ball, you might find it bunkered in the grave of some rameses or thothmes of old. it was here, i believe, that the cynical stranger, after watching my energetic but ineffectual game, remarked that he had always understood that there was a special tax for excavating in egypt. i have a pleasant recollection of egyptian golf in a match played with the late sirdar, then head of the intelligence department. when my ball was teed i observed that his negro caddie pointed two fingers at it and spat, which meant, as i was given to understand, that he cursed it for the rest of the game. certainly i got into every hazard in the course, though i must admit that i have accomplished that when there was no central african curse upon me. those were the days before the reconquest of the soudan, and i was told by colonel wingate--as he then was--that his spies coming down from omdurman not infrequently delivered their messages to him while carrying his golf clubs, to avoid the attention of the calipha’s spies, who abounded in cairo. on this occasion the sirdar beat me well, but with a christian caddie i turned the tables on him at dunbar, and now we have signed articles to play off the rubber at khartoum, no cursing allowed. when that first match was played we should as soon have thought of arranging to play golf in the moon. every now and then i give up the game in disgust at my own incompetence, but only to be lured on once more. hunting in an old desk i came upon an obituary which i had written for my game at some moment of special depression. it ran, “sacred to the memory of my golf. it was never strong, being permanently afflicted with a deformed stance and an undeveloped swing. after long weakness cheerfully borne it finally succumbed, and was buried in the eighteenth hole, regretted by numerous caddies.” however it is out and about once more, none the worse for this premature interment. there is said to be a considerable analogy between golf and billiards, so much so that success in the one generally leads to success in the other. personally, i have not found it so, for though i may claim, i suppose, to be above the average amateur at billiards, i am probably below him in golf. i have never quite attained the three-figure break, but i have so often topped the eighty, and even the ninety, that i have lived in constant hope. my friend, the late general drayson, who was a great authority on the game, used to recommend that every player should ascertain what he called his “decimal,” by which he meant how many innings it took him, whether scoring or not, to make 100. the number, of course, varies with the luck of the balls and the mood of the player; but, taken over a dozen or twenty games, it gives a fair average idea of the player’s form, and a man by himself can in this way test his own powers. if, for example, a player could, on an average, score 100 in twenty innings then his average would be five, which is very fair amateur form. if a man finds his “decimal” rise as high as ten over a sequence of games, he may be sure that he can hold his own against most players that he is likely to meet. i daresay my own decimal when i was in practise would be from six to eight. i was never good enough for the big matches, and though i once went in for the amateur championship it was not out of any illusions about my game, but because i was specially asked to do so, as it was advisable to strengthen the undoubted amateur element in the contest. by the luck of a bye, and by beating a player who was about my own form, i got into the third round, when i ran across mr. evans, who eventually reached the final with my scalp as well as several others at his girdle. i made 650 against his 1,000, which, as i was not helped by a bad fall from a motor bike a few days before, was as much as i could expect. forty-two off the red was my best effort. surely billiards is the king of all indoor games, and should have some writer who would do for it in prose what john nyren did for cricket. i have never seen any worthy appreciation of its infinite varieties from the forcing losing hazard which goes roaring into a top pocket with a clash upon the rail, to the feather stroke so delicate that it is only the quiver of reflected light upon the object ball which shows that it has indeed been struck. greatest of all is the ball heavily loaded with side which drifts down the long cushion and then is sucked against every apparent law into the pocket as though it were the centre of a whirlpool. mr. e. v. lucas is one who could do it with discernment. i have one funny recollection of billiards, when i wandered into some small hotel in a south-coast watering place, and for want of something to do played the marker. he was a pompous person in a frock coat with a very good opinion of his own game, which was really ruined by a habit he had of jerking. i won the match, which was not difficult to do, and then i thought it a kindness to point out to the man how he could improve his game. he took this badly, however, and hinted that he allowed gentlemen who played him to get the better of him. this in turn annoyed me, so i said: “look here. i will come in after dinner and you can show all you can do, and you shall have a sovereign if you win.” after dinner his game was worse than ever, while i had amazing luck and made the 100 in about three shots. as i put on my coat and was leaving the room the queer little fellow sidled up to me and said: “i beg pardon, sir, but is your name roberts?” my earliest recollection of cricket is not a particularly pleasant one. when i was a very small boy at a preparatory school i was one of a group of admirers who stood around watching a young cricketer who had just made his name hitting big hits off the school bowlers. one of the big hits landed on my knee-cap and the cricketer in his own famous arms carried me off to the school infirmary. the name, tom emmett, lingers in my memory, though it was some years before i appreciated exactly what he stood for in the game. i think, like most boys, i would rather have been knocked down by a first-class cricketer than picked up by a second-rater. that was the beginning of my acquaintance with a game which has on the whole given me more pleasure during my life than any other branch of sport. i have ended by being its victim, for a fast bowler some years ago happened to hit me twice in the same place under my left knee, which has left a permanent weakness. i have had as long an inning as one could reasonably expect, and carry many pleasant friendships and recollections away with me. i was a keen cricketer as a boy, but in my student days was too occupied to touch it. then i took it up again, but my progress was interrupted by work and travel. i had some cause, therefore, to hold on to the game as i had lost so much of it in my youth. finally, i fulfilled a secret ambition by getting into the fringe of first-class cricket, though rather, perhaps, through the good nature of others than my own merits. however, i can truly say that in the last season when i played some first-class cricket, including matches against kent, derbyshire, and the london county, i had an average of thirty-two for those games, so i may claim to have earned my place. i was more useful, however, in an amateur team, for i was a fairly steady and reliable bowler, and i could generally earn my place in that department, while with the m.c.c. the professional talent is usually so strong that the amateur who fails in batting and is not a particularly good field has no chance of atoning with the ball. yet even with the m.c.c. i have occasionally had a gleam of success. such a one came some years ago, when the team presented me with a little silver hat for getting three consecutive clean-bowled wickets against the gentlemen of warwick. one of my victims explained his downfall by assuring me that he had it thoroughly in his head that i was a left-handed bowler, and when the ball came from my right hand he was too bewildered to stop it. the reason is not so good as that of an artist who, when i had bowled him out, exclaimed: “who can play against a man who bowls in a crude pink shirt against an olive-green background?” a bowler has many days when everything is against him, when a hard, smooth wicket takes all the spin and devil out of him, when he goes all round and over the wicket, when lofted balls refuse to come to hand, or, if they do come, refuse to stay. but, on the other hand, he has his recompense with many a stroke of good fortune. it was in such a moment that i had the good luck to get the wicket of w. g. grace, the greatest of all cricketers. w. g. had his speedy revenge. there was nothing more childlike and bland than that slow, tossed-up bowling of his, and nothing more subtle and treacherous. he was always on the wicket or about it, never sent down a really loose ball, worked continually a few inches from the leg, and had a perfect command of length. it was the latter quality which was my downfall. i had made some thirty or forty, and began to relax in the deep respect with which i faced the doctor’s deliveries. i had driven him for four, and jumped out at him again the next ball. seeing my intention, as a good bowler does, he dropped his ball a foot or two shorter. i reached it with difficulty, but again i scored four. by this time i was very pleased with myself, and could see no reason why every one of these delightful slows should not mean a four to me. out i danced to reach the next one on the half volley. it was tossed a little higher up in the air, which gave the delusion that it was coming right up to the bat, but as a matter of fact it pitched well short of my reach, broke sharply across and lilley, the wicket-keeper, had my bails off in a twinkling. one feels rather cheap when one walks from the middle of the pitch to the pavilion, longing to kick oneself for one’s own foolishness all the way. i have only once felt smaller, and that was when i was bowled by a. p. lucas, by the most singular ball that i have ever received. he propelled it like a quoit into the air to a height of at least 30 feet, and it fell straight and true on to the top of the bails. i have often wondered what a good batsman would have made of that ball. to play it one would have needed to turn the blade of the bat straight up, and could hardly fail to give a chance. i tried to cut it off my stumps, with the result that i knocked down my wicket and broke my bat, while the ball fell in the midst of this general chaos. i spent the rest of the day wondering gloomily what i ought to have done--and i am wondering yet. i have had two unusual experiences upon lord’s ground. one was that i got a century in the very first match that i played there. it was an unimportant game, it is true, but still the surprising fact remained. it was a heavy day, and my bat, still encrusted with the classic mud, hangs as a treasured relic in my hall. the other was less pleasant and even more surprising. i was playing for the club against kent, and faced for the first time bradley, who was that year one of the fastest bowlers in england. his first delivery i hardly saw, and it landed with a terrific thud upon my thigh. a little occasional pain is one of the chances of cricket, and one takes it as cheerfully as one can, but on this occasion it suddenly became sharp to an unbearable degree. i clapped my hand to the spot, and found to my amazement that i was on fire. the ball had landed straight on a small tin vesta box in my trousers pocket, had splintered the box, and set the matches ablaze. it did not take me long to turn out my pocket and scatter the burning vestas over the grass. i should have thought this incident unique, but alec hearne, to whom i told it, assured me that he had seen more than one accident of the kind. w. g. was greatly amused. “couldn’t get you out--had to set you on fire!” he cried, in the high voice which seemed so queer from so big a body. there are certain matches which stand out in one’s memory for their peculiar surroundings. one was a match played against cape de verde at that island on the way to south africa. there is an atlantic telegraph station there with a large staff, and they turn out an excellent eleven. i understand that they played each transport as it passed, and that they had defeated all, including the guards. we made up a very fair team, however, under the captaincy of lord henry scott, and after a hard fight we defeated the islanders. i don’t know how many of our eleven left their bones in south africa; three at least--blasson, douglas forbes (who made our top score), and young maxwell craig never returned. i remember one even more tragic match in which i played for the incogniti against aldershot division a few months before the african war. the regiments quartered there were those which afterwards saw the hardest service. major ray, who made the top score, was killed at magersfontein. young stanley, who went in first with me, met his death in the yeomanry. taking the two teams right through, i am sure that half the men were killed or wounded within two years. how little we could have foreseen it that sunny summer day! it is dangerous when an old cricketer begins to reminisce, because so much comes back to his mind. he has but to smell the hot rubber of a bat handle to be flooded with memories. they are not always glorious. i remember three ladies coming to see me play against one of the bedford schools. the boys politely applauded as i approached the wicket. a very small boy lobbed up the first ball which i played at. it went up into the air, and was caught at point by the very smallest boy i have ever seen in decent cricket. it seemed to me about a mile as i walked back from the wicket to the pavilion. i don’t think those three ladies ever recovered their confidence in my cricketing powers. as a set-off to this confession of failure let me add a small instance of success, where by “taking thought” i saved a minor international match. it was at the hague in 1892, and the game was a wandering british team against holland. the dutch were an excellent sporting lot, and had one remarkable bowler in posthuma, a left-hander, who had so huge a break with his slow ball that it was not uncommon for him to pitch the ball right outside the matting on which we played and yet bring it on to the wicket. we won our various local matches without much difficulty, but we were aware that we should have a stiff fight with united holland, the more so as dutch hospitality was almost as dangerous to our play as dutch cricket. so it proved, and we were in the position that with four wickets in hand they had only fifteen runs to make with two batsmen well set. i had not bowled during the tour, for as we were a scratch team, mostly from the schoolmaster class, we did not know each other’s capacity. seeing, however, that things were getting desperate, i went the length of asking our skipper to give me a chance. i had observed that the batsmen had been very well taught by their english professional, and that they all played in most orthodox fashion with a perfectly straight bat. that was why i thought i might get them out. i brought every fielder round to the off, for i felt that they would not think it correct to pull, and i tossed up good length balls about a foot on the off side. it came off exactly as i expected. the pro. had not told them what to do with that particular sort of tosh, and the four men were all caught for as many runs by mid-off or cover. the team in their exultation proceeded to carry me into the pavilion, but whether it was my sixteen stone or the heat of the weather, they tired of the job midway and let me down with a crash which shook the breath out of me--so holland was avenged. i played against them again when they came to england, and made sixty-seven, but got no wickets, for they had mastered the off-side theory. some of my quaintest cricket reminiscences are in connection with j. m. barrie’s team--the “allah-akbarries,” or “lord help us” as we were called. we played in the old style, caring little about the game and a good deal about a jolly time and pleasant scenery. broadway, the country home of mr. navarro and his wife, formerly mary anderson, the famous actress, was one of our favourite haunts, and for several years in succession we played the artists there. bernard partridge, barrie, a. e. w. mason, abbey the academician, blomfield the architect, marriott watson, charles whibley, and others of note took part, and there were many whimsical happenings, which were good fun if they were not good cricket. i thought all record of our games had faded from human ken, but lately a controversy was raised over mr. armstrong, the australian captain, bowling the same man from opposite ends on consecutive overs. this led to the following paragraph in a birmingham paper, which, i may say, entirely exaggerates my powers but is otherwise correct. “barrie and armstrong. “i am not surprised that in the matter of mr. armstrong’s conduct in bowling two consecutive overs from different ends, no reference has been made to the important precedent which on a similar occasion sir james barrie failed to establish (writes a correspondent of the “nation”). the occasion was his captaincy (at broadway, in worcestershire) of an eleven of writers against a strong team of alleged artists. the circumstances were these. one side had compiled seventy-two runs, chiefly, if not wholly, contributed by sir arthur conan doyle. “the sun-worshippers had thereupon responded with an equal number of runs for the loss of all but their last wicket. the ninth wicket had fallen to the last ball of sir arthur’s over, the other eight having succumbed to the same performer, then in his prime. actuated, apparently, by the belief that sir arthur was the only bowler of his side capable of taking or reaching a wicket, even in worcestershire, sir james thereupon put him on at the opposite end. “before, however, he could take a practice ball, a shout was heard from the artists’ pavilion, and the nine unengaged players were seen issuing from it to contest our captain’s decision. after an exciting contest, it was ultimately given in their favour, with the result that the first ball of the new bowler was hit for two, assisted by overthrows, and the innings and match were won by the artists.” of barrie’s team i remember that it was printed at the bottom of our cards that the practice ground was in the “national observer” office. mr. abbey, the famous artist, usually captained against barrie, and it was part of the agreement that each should have a full pitch to leg just to start his score. i remember my horror when by mistake i bowled a straight first ball to abbey, and so broke the unwritten law as well as the wicket. abbey knew nothing of the game, but barrie was no novice. he bowled an insidious left-hand good length ball coming from leg which was always likely to get a wicket. talking of bowling, i have twice performed the rare feat of getting all ten wickets. once it was against a london club, and once i ran through the side of a dragoon regiment at norwich. my best performance at lords was seven wickets for fifty-one against cambridgeshire in 1904. of fencing my experience has been limited, and yet i have seen enough to realize what a splendid toughening exercise it is. i nearly had an ugly mishap when practising it. i had visited a medical man in southsea who was an expert with the foils, and at his invitation had a bout with him. i had put on the mask and glove, but was loath to have the trouble of fastening on the heavy chest plastron. he insisted, however, and his insistence saved me from an awkward wound, for, coming in heavily upon a thrust, his foil broke a few inches from the end, and the sharp point thus created went deeply into the pad which covered me. i learned a lesson that day. on the whole, considering the amount of varied sport which i have done, i have come off very well as regards bodily injury. one finger broken at football, two at cricket (one after the other in the same season), the disablement of my knee--that almost exhausts it. though a heavy man and quite an indifferent rider, i have never hurt myself in a fair selection of falls in the hunting field and elsewhere. once, as i have narrated, when i was down, the horse kicked me over the eye with his forefoot, but i got off with a rather ragged wound, though it might have been very much more serious. indeed, when it comes to escapes, i have had more than my share of luck. one of the worst was in a motor accident, when the machine, which weighed over a ton, ran up a high bank, threw me out on a gravel drive below, and then, turning over, fell on top of me. the steering wheel projected slightly from the rest, and thus broke the impact and undoubtedly saved my life, but it gave way under the strain, and the weight of the car settled across my spine just below the neck, pinning my face down on the gravel, and pressing with such terrific force as to make it impossible to utter a sound. i felt the weight getting heavier moment by moment, and wondered how long my vertebræ could stand it. however, they did so long enough to enable a crowd to collect and the car to be levered off me. i should think there are few who can say that they have held up a ton weight across their spine and lived unparalyzed to talk about it. it is an acrobatic feat which i have no desire to repeat. there is plenty of sport in driving one’s own motor and meeting the hundred and one unexpected roadside adventures and difficulties which are continually arising. these were greater a few years ago, when motors were themselves less solidly and accurately constructed, drivers were less skilled, and frightened horses were more in evidence. no invention of modern civilization has done so much for developing a man’s power of resource and judgment as the motor. to meet and overcome a sudden emergency is the best of human training, and if a man is his own driver and mechanician on a fairly long journey he can hardly fail to have some experience of it. i well remember in the early days of motoring going up to birmingham to take delivery of my new twelve horse-power wolseley. i had invested in the sort of peaked yachting cap which was considered the correct badge of the motorist in those days, but as i paced the platform of new street station a woman removed any conceit i might have over my headgear, by asking me peremptorily how the trains ran to walsall. she took me for one of the officials. i got the car safely home, and no doubt it was a good car as things went at that time, but the secret of safe brakes had not yet been discovered, and my pair used to break as if they were glass. more than once i have known what it is to steer a car when it is flying backwards under no control down a winding hill. looking back at those days it seems to me that i was under the car nearly as much as on the top of it, for every repair had to be done from below. there were few accidents from smashing my differential, seizing my engines, and stripping my gears, which i have not endured. it was a chain-driven machine, and i can well remember one absurd incident when the chain jumped the cogs and fell off. we were on a long slope of 3 miles and ran on with the engine turned off quite unconscious of what had occurred. when we reached level ground the car naturally stopped, and we got out, opened the bonnet, tested the electricity, and were utterly puzzled as to what was amiss, when a yokel in a cart arrived waving our motive power over his head. he had picked it up on the road. our descendants will never realize the terror of the horses at this innovation, nor the absurd scenes which it caused. on one occasion i was motoring down a narrow lane in norfolk, with my mother in the open tonneau. coming round a curve we came upon two carts, one behind the other. the leading horse, which had apparently never seen a motor before, propped his forelegs out, his ears shot forward, his eyes stared rigidly and then in a moment he whirled round, ran up the bank, and tried to escape behind his comrade. this he could have done but for the cart, which he also dragged up the bank. horse and cart fell sideways on the other horse and cart, and there was such a mixture that you could not disentangle it. the carts were full of turnips and these formed a top dressing over the interlaced shafts and the struggling horses. i sprang out and was trying to help the enraged farmer to get something right end up, when i glanced at my own car which was almost involved in the pile. there was my dear old mother sitting calmly knitting in the midst of all the chaos. it was really like something in a dream. my most remarkable motor car experience was when i drove my own sixteen horse-power dietrich-lorraine in the international road competition organized by prince henry of prussia in 1911. this affair is discussed later, when i come to the preludes of war. i came away from it with sinister forebodings. the impression left on my mind by the whole incident is shown by the fact that one of the first things i did when i got to london was to recommend a firm of which i am director to remove a large sum which it had lying in berlin. i have no doubt that it would have continued to lie there and that we might have lost it. as to the contest itself it ended in a british victory, which was owing to the staunch way in which we helped each other when in difficulties, while the germans were more a crowd of individuals than a team. their cars were excellent and so was their driving. my own little car did very well and only dropped marks at sutton bank in yorkshire, that terrible hill, one in three at one point, with a hair-pin bend. when we finally panted out our strength i put my light-weight chauffeur to the wheel, ran round, and fairly boosted her up from behind, but we were fined so many marks for my leaving the driving wheel. not to get up would have meant three times the forfeit, so my tactics were well justified. no doubt the coming science of aviation will develop the same qualities as motor driving to an even higher degree. it is a form of sport in which i have only aspirations and little experience. i had one balloon ascent in which we covered some 25 miles and ascended 6,000 feet, which was so delightful an expedition that i have always been eager for another and a longer one. a man has a natural trepidation the first time he leaves the ground, but i remember that, as i stood by the basket with the gas-bag swinging about above me and the assistants clinging to the ropes, some one pointed out an elderly gentleman and said: “that is the famous mr. so-and-so, the aeronaut.” i saw a venerable person and i asked how many ascents he had made. “about a thousand,” was the answer. no eloquence or reasoning could have convinced me so completely that i might get into the basket with a cheerful mind, though i will admit that for the first minute or so one feels very strange, and keeps an uncommonly tight grip of the side-ropes. this soon passes, however, and one is lost in the wonder of the prospect and the glorious feeling of freedom and detachment. as in a ship, it is the moment of nearing land once more which is the moment of danger--or, at least, of discomfort; but beyond a bump or two, we came to rest very quietly in the heart of a kentish hop-field. i had one aeroplane excursion in rather early days, but the experience was not entirely a pleasant one. machines were under-engined in those days and very much at the mercy of the wind. we went up at hendon--may 25, 1911, the date--but the machine was a heavy bi-plane, and though it went down wind like a swallow it was more serious when we turned and found, looking down, that the objects below us were stationary or even inclined to drift backwards. however, we got back to the field at last, and i think the pilot was as relieved as i. what impressed me most was the terrible racket of the propeller, comparing so unfavourably with the delicious calm of the balloon journey. there is one form of sport in which i have, i think, been able to do some practical good, for i can claim to have been the first to introduce skis into the grisons division of switzerland, or at least to demonstrate their practical utility as a means of getting across in winter from one valley to another. it was in 1894 that i read nansen’s account of his crossing of greenland, and thus became interested in the subject of ski-ing. it chanced that i was compelled to spend that winter in the davos valley, and i spoke about the matter to tobias branger, a sporting tradesman in the village, who in turn interested his brother. we sent for skis from norway, and for some weeks afforded innocent amusement to a large number of people who watched our awkward movements and complex tumbles. the brangers made much better progress than i. at the end of a month or so we felt that we were getting more expert, and determined to climb the jacobshorn, a considerable hill just opposite the davos hotel. we had to carry our unwieldy skis upon our backs until we had passed the fir trees which line its slopes, but once in the open we made splendid progress, and had the satisfaction of seeing the flags in the village dipped in our honour when we reached the summit. but it was only in returning that we got the full flavour of ski-ing. in ascending you shuffle up by long zig-zags, the only advantage of your footgear being that it is carrying you over snow which would engulf you without it. but coming back you simply turn your long toes and let yourself go, gliding delightfully over the gentle slopes, flying down the steeper ones, taking an occasional cropper, but getting as near to flying as any earth-bound man can. in that glorious air it is a delightful experience. encouraged by our success with the jacobshorn, we determined to show the utility of our accomplishment by opening up communications with arosa, which lies in a parallel valley and can only be reached in winter by a very long and roundabout railway journey. to do this we had to cross a high pass, and then drop down on the other side. it was a most interesting journey, and we felt all the pride of pioneers as we arrived in arosa. i have no doubt that what we did would seem absurdly simple to norwegians or others who were apt at the game, but we had to find things out for ourselves and it was sometimes rather terrifying. the sun had not yet softened the snow on one sharp slope across which we had to go, and we had to stamp with our skis in order to get any foothold. on our left the snow slope ended in a chasm from which a blue smoke or fog rose in the morning air. i hardly dared look in that direction, but from the corner of my eye i saw the vapour of the abyss. i stamped along and the two gallant switzers got on my left, so that if i slipped the shock would come upon them. we had no rope by which we could link up. we got across all right and perhaps we exaggerated the danger, but it was not a pleasant experience. then i remember that we came to an absolute precipice, up which no doubt the path zigzags in summer. it was not of course perpendicular, but it seemed little removed from it, and it had just slope enough to hold the snow. it looked impassable, but the brangers had picked up a lot in some way of their own. they took off their skis, fastened them together with a thong, and on this toboggan they sat, pushing themselves over the edge, and going down amid a tremendous spray of flying snow. when they had reached safety they beckoned to me to follow. i had done as they did, and was sitting on my skis preparatory to launching myself when a fearsome thing happened, for my skis shot from under me, flew down the slope, and vanished in huge bounds among the snow mounds beyond. it was a nasty moment, and the poor brangers stood looking up at me some hundreds of feet below me in a dismal state of mind. however, there was no possible choice as to what to do, so i did it. i let myself go over the edge, and came squattering down, with legs and arms extended to check the momentum. a minute later i was rolling covered with snow at the feet of my guides, and my skis were found some hundreds of yards away, so no harm was done after all. i remember that when we signed the hotel register tobias branger filled up the space after my name, in which the new arrival had to describe his profession, by the words “sportes-mann,” which i took as a compliment. it was at any rate more pleasant than the german description of my golf clubs, which went astray on the railway and turned up at last with the official description of “kinderspieler” (child’s toys) attached to them. to return to the skis they are no doubt in very general use, but i think i am right in saying that these and other excursions of ours first demonstrated their possibilities to the people of the country and have certainly sent a good many thousands of pounds since then into switzerland. if my rather rambling career in sport has been of any practical value to any one, it is probably in this matter, and also, perhaps, in the opening up of miniature rifle-ranges in 1901, when the idea was young in this country, and when my hindhead range was the pioneer and the model for many others. a pleasing souvenir of my work on rifle clubs is to be found in the conan doyle cup, which was presented by my friend sir john langman, and is still shot for every year at bisley by civilian teams. on the whole as i look back there is no regret in my mind for the time that i have devoted to sport. it gives health and strength but above all it gives a certain balance of mind without which a man is not complete. to give and to take, to accept success modestly and defeat bravely, to fight against odds, to stick to one’s point, to give credit to your enemy and value your friend--these are some of the lessons which true sport should impart. chapter xxv to the rocky mountains in 1914 baseball--parkman--ticonderoga--prairie towns--procession of ceres--relics of the past--a moose--prospects for emigrants--jasper park--the great divide--algonquin park. in 1914, with little perception of how near we were to the greatest event of the world’s history, we accepted an invitation from the canadian government to inspect the national reserve at jasper park in the northern rockies. the grand trunk railway (canadian) made matters easy for us by generously undertaking to pass us over their system and to place a private car at our disposal. this proved to be a gloriously comfortable and compact little home, consisting of a parlour, a dining-room and a bedroom. it belonged to mr. chamberlin, the president of the line, who allowed us the use of it. full of anticipation we started off in may upon our long and pleasant journey. our first point was new york, where we hoped to put in a week of sight-seeing, since my wife had never been to america. then we were to go north and meet our kind hosts of canada. at the plaza hotel of new york we found ourselves in pleasant quarters for a hectic week. here are a few impressions. we went to see a baseball game at new york--a first-class match, as we should say--or “some game,” as a native expert described it. i looked on it all with the critical but sympathetic eyes of an experienced though decrepit cricketer. the men were fine fellows, harder looking than most of our professionals--indeed they train continually, and some of the teams had even before the days of prohibition to practise complete abstinence, which is said to show its good results not so much in physical fitness as in the mental quickness which is very essential in the game. the catching seemed to me extraordinarily good, especially the judging of the long catches near the “bleachers,” as the outfields which are far from any shade are called. the throwing in is also remarkably hard and accurate, and, if applied to cricket, would astonish some of our batsmen. the men earn anything from £1,000 to £1,500 in the season. this money question is a weak point of the game, as it is among our own soccer clubs, since it means that the largest purse has the best team, and there is no necessary relation between the player and the place he plays for. thus we looked upon new york defeating the philadelphia athletics, but there was no more reason to suppose that new york had actually produced one team than that philadelphia had produced the other. for this reason the smaller matches, such as are played between local teams or colleges, seem to me to be more exciting, as they do represent something definite. the pitcher is the man who commands the highest salary and has mastered the hardest part of the game. his pace is remarkable, far faster, i should say, than any bowling; but of course it is a throw, and as such would not be possible in the cricket field. i had one uneasy moment when i was asked in canada to take the bat and open a baseball game. the pitcher, fortunately, was merciful, and the ball came swift but true. i steadied myself by trying to imagine that it was a bat which i held in my grasp and that this was a full toss, which asked to be hit over the ropes. fortunately, i got it fairly in the middle and it went on its appointed way, whizzing past the ear of a photographer, who expected me to pat it. i should not care to have to duplicate the performance--nor would the photographer. i took the opportunity when i was in new york to inspect the two famous prisons, the tombs and sing sing. the tombs is in the very heart of the city, and a gloomy, ill-boding place it is when seen from without. within it is equally dismal. i walked round in a somewhat shamefaced way, for it makes you feel so when you encounter human suffering which you cannot relieve. warders and prisoners seemed however to be cheerful enough, and there was an off-hand way of doing things which seemed strange after our rigid methods. a chinese prisoner, for example, was standing at the bottom of the lift, and i heard the warder shout through the tube, “have you got room for another chink in number three?” i had a talk with one strange englishman who was barred in like a wild beast. he spoke of the various prisons, of which he had a wide acquaintance, exactly as if they were hotels which he was recommending or condemning. “toronto is a very poor show. the food is bad. i hope i may never see toronto gaol again. detroit is better. i had quite a pleasant time in detroit.” and so on. he spoke and looked like a gentleman, but i could quite imagine, in spite of his genial manner, that he was a dangerous crook. when i left him he said: “well, bye-bye! sorry you have to go! we can’t all be out and about, can we?” in the same week i went to sing sing, the state penitentiary, which is some twenty miles from the city on the banks of the hudson. it is an ancient building, dating from the middle of last century, and it certainly should be condemned by a rich and prosperous community. by a strange coincidence the convicts were having one of their few treats in the year that day, and i was able to see them all assembled together in the great hall, listening to a music-hall troupe from new york. poor devils, all the forced, vulgar gaiety of the songs and the antics of half-clad women must have provoked a terrible reaction in their minds! many of them had, i observed, abnormalities of cranium or of features which made it clear that they were not wholly responsible for their actions. there was a good sprinkling of coloured men among them. here and there i noticed an intelligent and even a good face. one wondered how they got there. i was locked up afterwards in one of the cells--seven feet by four--and i was also placed in the electrocution chair, a very ordinary, stout, cane-bottomed seat, with a good many sinister wires dangling round it. i had a long talk with the governor, who seemed in himself to be a humane man, but terribly hampered by the awful building which he had to administer. one morning of early june “my lady sunshine” and i--(if i may be allowed to quote the charmingly appropriate name which the new york press had given to my wife) left new york for parkman land, which i had long wished to explore. we were glad to get away as we had been considerably harassed by the ubiquitous and energetic american reporter. this individual is really, in nine cases out of ten, a very good fellow, and if you will treat him with decent civility he will make the best of you with the public. it is absurd for travellers to be rude to him, as is too often the attitude of the wandering briton. the man is under orders from his paper, and if he returns without results it is not a compliment upon his delicacy which will await him. he is out to see you and describe you, and if he finds you an ill-tempered, cantankerous curmudgeon, he very naturally says so and turns out some excellent spicy reading at your expense. the indignant briton imagines that this is done in revenge. the reporter would not be human if it did not amuse him to do it, but it very often represents the exact impression which the vituperative traveller has made upon the pressman, himself as often as not an overworked and highly-strung man. reminiscences of interviews are occasionally amusing. i can remember that on my previous visit i was approached one night by an interviewer in a very marked state of intoxication. he was so drunk that i wondered what in the world he would make of his subject, and i bought his paper next day to see. to my amusement i found that i had made the worst possible impression upon him. he had found no good in me at all. he may even have attributed to me his own weakness, like the scotch toper who said: “sandy drank that hard that by the end of the evening i couldn’t see him.” to return to parkman land. i am surprised to find how few americans and fewer canadians there are who appreciate that great historian at his true worth. i wonder whether any man of letters has ever devoted himself to a task with such whole-hearted devotion as parkman. he knew the old bloody frontier as scott knew the border marches. he was soaked in new england tradition. he prepared himself for writing about indians by living for months in their wigwams. he was intimate with old french life, and he spent some time in a religious house that he might catch something of the spirit which played so great a part in the early history of canada. on the top of all this he had the well-balanced, unprejudiced mind of the great chronicler, and he cultivated a style which was equally removed from insipidity and from affectation. as to his industry and resolution, they are shown by the fact that he completed his volumes after he had been stricken by blindness. it is hard to name any historian who has such an equipment as this. from his “pioneers of the new world” to his “conspiracy of pontiac” i have read his twelve volumes twice over, and put some small reflection of them into my “refugees.” we explored not only the beautiful, tragic lake george, but also its great neighbour lake champlain, almost as full of historical reminiscence. upon this, level with the head of the smaller lake, stood ticonderoga, the chief seat of the french canadian power. some five miles separate it from lake george, up which the british came buzzing whenever they were strong enough to do so. once in front of the palisades of ticonderoga, they met with heavy defeat, and yet once again, by the valour of the newly-enrolled black watch, they swept the place off the map. i wonder if stevenson had actually been there before he wrote his eerie haunting ballad--the second finest of the sort, in my opinion, in our literature. it is more than likely, since he spent some time in the neighbouring adirondacks. pious hands were restoring the old fort of ticonderoga, much of which has been uncovered. all day we skirted lake champlain, into which the old french explorer first found his way, and where he made the dreadful mistake of mixing in indian warfare, which brought the whole bloodthirsty vendetta of the five nations upon the young french settlements. up at the head of the lake we saw plattsburg, where the americans gained a victory in the war of 1812. the sight of these battle-fields, whether they mark british or american successes, always fills me with horror. if the war of 1776 was, as i hold, a glorious mistake, that of 1812 was a senseless blunder. had neither occurred, the whole of north america would now be one magnificent undivided country, pursuing its own independent destiny, and yet united in such unblemished ties of blood and memory to the old country that each could lean at all times upon the other. it is best for britishers, no doubt, that we should never lean upon anything bigger than ourselves. but i see no glory in these struggles, and little wisdom in the statesmen who waged them. among them they split the race from base to summit, and who has been the gainer? not britain, who was alienated from so many of her very best children. not america, who lost canada and had on her hands a civil war which a united empire could have avoided. ah well, there is a controlling force somewhere, and the highest wisdom is to believe that all things are ordered for the best. about evening we crossed the canadian frontier, the richelieu river, down which the old iroquois scalping parties used to creep, gleaming coldly in the twilight. there is nothing to show where you have crossed that border. there is the same sort of country, the same cultivation, the same plain wooden houses. nothing was changed save that suddenly i saw a little old ensign flying on a gable, and it gives you a thrill when you have not seen it for a time. it is not until one has reached the prairie country that the traveller meets with new conditions and new problems. he traverses ontario with its prosperous mixed farms and its fruit-growing villages, but the general effect is the same as in eastern america. then comes the enormous stretch of the great lakes, those wonderful inland seas, with great ocean-going steamers. we saw the newly built _noronic_, destined altogether for passenger traffic, and worthy to compare, both in internal fittings and outward appearance, with many an atlantic liner. the indians looked in amazement at la salle’s little vessel. i wondered what la salle and his men would think of the _noronic_! for two days in great comfort we voyaged over the inland waters. they lay peaceful for our passage, but we heard grim stories of winter gusts and of ships which were never heard of more. it is not surprising that there should be accidents, for the number of vessels is extraordinary, and being constructed with the one idea of carrying the maximum of cargo, they appeared to be not very stable. i am speaking now of the whale-back freight carriers and not of the fine passenger service, which could not be beaten. i have said that the number of vessels is extraordinary. i have been told that the tonnage passing through sault ste. marie, where the lakes join, is greater than that of any port in the world. all the supplies and manufactures for the west move one way, while the corn of the great prairie, and the ores from the lake superior copper and iron mines move the other. in the fall there comes the triumphant procession of the harvest. surely in more poetic days banners might have waved and cymbals clashed, and priests of ceres sung their hymns in the vanguard, as this flotilla of mercy moved majestically over the face of the waters to the aid of hungry europe. however, we have cut out the frills, to use the vernacular, though life would be none the worse could we tinge it a little with the iridescence of romance. we stopped at sault ste. marie, the neck of the hour-glass between the two great lakes of huron and superior. there were several things there which are worthy of record. the lakes are of a different level, and the lock which avoids the dangerous rapids is on an enormous scale; but, beside it, unnoticed save by those who know where to look and what to look for, there is a little stone-lined cutting no larger than an uncovered drain--it is the detour by which for centuries the voyageurs, trappers, and explorers moved their canoes round the sault or fall on their journey to the great solitudes beyond. close by it is one of the old hudson bay log forts, with its fireproof roof, its loop-holed walls, and every other device for indian fighting. very small and mean these things look by the side of the great locks and the huge steamers within them. but where would locks and steamers have been had these others not taken their lives in their hands to clear the way? the twin cities of fort william and port arthur, at the head of lake superior, form the most growing community of canada. they call them twin cities, but i expect, like their siamese predecessors, they will grow into one. already the suburbs join each other, though proximity does not always lead to amalgamation or even to cordiality, as in the adjacent towns of st. paul and minneapolis. when the little american boy was asked in sunday school who persecuted saint paul, he “guessed it was minneapolis.” but in the case of fort william and port arthur they are so evidently interdependent that it is difficult to believe that they will fail to coalesce; when they do, i am of opinion that they may grow to be a canadian chicago, and possibly become the greatest city in the country. all lines converge there, as does all the lake traffic, and everything from east to west must pass through it. if i were a rich man and wished to become richer, i should assuredly buy land in the twin cities. though they lie in the very centre of the broadest portion of the continent, the water communications are so wonderful that an ocean-going steamer from liverpool or glasgow can now unload at their quays. the grain elevators of fort william are really majestic erections, and with a little change of their construction might be æsthetic as well. even now the huge cylinders into which they are divided look at a little distance not unlike the columns of luxor. this branch of human ingenuity has been pushed at fort william to its extreme. the last word has been said there upon every question covering the handling of grain. by some process, which is far beyond my unmechanical brain, the stuff is even divided automatically according to its quality, and there are special hospital elevators where damaged grain can be worked up into a more perfect article. by the way, it was here, while lying at a steamship wharf on the very edge of the city, that i first made the acquaintance of one of the original inhabitants of canada. a cleared plain stretched from the ship to a wood some hundreds of yards off. as i stood upon deck i saw what i imagined to be a horse wander out of the wood and begin to graze in the clearing. the creature seemed ewe-necked beyond all possibility, and looking closer i saw to my surprise that it was a wild hornless moose. could anything be more characteristic of the present condition of canada--the great mechanical developments of fort william within gunshot of me on one side, and this shy wanderer of the wilderness on the other? in a few years the dweller in the great city will read of my experience with the same mixture of incredulity and surprise with which we read the occasional correspondent’s whose grandfather shot a woodcock in maida vale. the true division between the east and west of canada is not the great lakes, which are so valuable as a waterway, but lies in the 500 miles of country between the lakes and winnipeg. it is barren, but beautiful, covered with forest which is not large enough to be of value as lumber. it is a country of rolling plains covered with low trees with rivers in the valleys. the soil is poor. it is really a problem what to do with this belt, which is small according to canadian distance, but is none the less broader than the distance between london and edinburgh. unless minerals are found in it, i should think that it will be to canada what the highlands of scotland are to britain--a region set apart for sport because it has no other economic use. the singular thing about this barren tree-land is that it quite suddenly changes to the fertile prairie at a point to the east of winnipeg. i presume that there is some geological reason, but it was strange to see the fertile plain run up to the barren woods with as clear a division as there is between the sea and the shore. and now one reaches the west of winnipeg and that prairie which means so much both to canada and to the world. it was wonderfully impressive to travel swiftly all day from the early summer dawn to the latest evening light, and to see always the same little clusters of houses, always the same distant farms, always the same huge expanse stretching to the distant skyline, mottled with cattle, or green with the half-grown crops. you think these people are lonely. what about the people beyond them and beyond them again, each family in its rude barracks in the midst of the 160 acres which form the minimum farm? no doubt they are lonely, and yet there are alleviations. when men or women are working on their own property and seeing their fortune growing, they have pleasant thoughts to bear them company. it is the women, i am told, who feel it most, and who go prairie-mad. now they have rigged telephone circles which connect up small groups of farms and enable the women to relieve their lives by a little friendly gossip, when the whole district thrills to the news that mrs. jones has been in the cars to winnipeg and bought a new bonnet. at the worst the loneliness of the prairie can never, one would think, have the soul-killing effect of loneliness in a town. “there is always the wind on the heath, brother.” besides, the wireless has now arrived, and that is the best friend of the lonely man. land is not so easily picked up by the emigrant as in the old days, when 160 acres beside the railroad were given away free. there was still in 1914 free land to be had, but it was in the back country. however, this back country of to-day is always liable to be opened up by the branch railway lines to-morrow. on the whole, however, it seems to be more economical, if the emigrant has the money, to buy a partially developed well-situated farm than to take up a virgin homestead. that is what the american emigrants do who have been pouring into the country, and they know best the value of such farms, having usually come from exactly similar ones just across the border, the only difference being that they can get ten acres in canada for the price of one in minnesota or iowa. they hasten to take out their papers of naturalization, and make, it is said, most excellent and contented citizens. their energy and industry are remarkable. a body of them had reached the land which they proposed to buy about the time that we were in the west; they had come over the border with their wagons, their horses, and their ploughs. being taken to the spot by the land agent, the leader of the party tested the soil, cast a rapid glance over the general prairie, and then cried: “i guess this will do, boys. get off the ploughs.” the agent who was present told me that they had broken an acre of the prairie before they slept that night. these men were german lutherans from minnesota, and they settled in the neighbourhood of scott. the gains on the farms are very considerable. it is not unusual for a man to pay every expense which he has incurred, including the price of the land, within the first two years. after that, with decent luck, he should be a prosperous man, able to bring up a family in ease and comfort. if he be british, and desires to return to the old country, it should not be difficult for him to save enough in ten or twelve years to make himself, after selling his farm, more or less independent for life. that is, as it seems to me, an important consideration for many people who hesitate to break all the old ties and feel that they are leaving their motherland for ever. so much about farms and farming. i cannot see how one can write about this western part and avoid the subject which is written in green and gold from sky to sky. there is nothing else. nowhere is there any sign of yesterday--not a cairn, not a monument. life has passed here, but has left no footstep behind. but stay, the one thing which the old life still leaves is just this one thing--footsteps. look at them in the little narrow black paths which converge to the water--little dark ruts which wind and twist. those are the buffalo runs of old. gone are the cree and blackfoot hunters who shot them down. gone, too, the fur-traders who bought the skins. chief factor mactavish, who entered into the great company’s service as a boy, spent his life in slow promotion from fort this to fort that, and made a decent presbyterian woman of some indian squaw, finally saw with horror in his old age that the world was crowding his wild beasts out of their pastures. gone are the great herds upon which both indian hunter and fur-trader were parasitical. indian, trader and buffalo all have passed, and here on the great plains are these narrow runways as the last remaining sign of a vanished world. edmonton is the capital of the western side of the prairie, even as winnipeg is of the eastern. i do not suppose the average briton has the least conception of the amenities of winnipeg. he would probably be surprised to hear that the fort garry hotel there is nearly as modern and luxurious as any hotel in northumberland avenue. there were no such luxuries in 1914 in edmonton. the town was in a strangely half-formed condition, rude and raw, but with a great atmosphere of energy, bustle, and future greatness. with its railway connections and waterways it is bound to be a large city. at the time of our visit the streets were full of out-of-works, great husky men, some of them of magnificent physique, who found themselves at a loss, on account of cessations in railroad construction. they told me that they would soon be reabsorbed, but meantime the situation was the rudest object-lesson in economics that i have ever witnessed. here were these splendid men, ready and willing to work. here was a new country calling in every direction for labour. how come the two things to be even temporarily disconnected? there could be but one word. it was want of capital. and why was the capital wanting? why was the work of the railroads held up? because the money market was tight in london--london which finds, according to the most recent figures, 73 per cent of all the moneys with which canada is developed. such was the state of things. what will amend it? how can capital be made to flow into the best channels? by encouragement and security and the hope of good returns. i never heard of any system of socialism which did not seem to defeat the very object which it had at heart. and yet it was surely deplorable that the men should be there, and that the work should be there, and that none could command the link which would unite them. a line of low distant hills broke the interminable plain which has extended with hardly a rising for 1,500 miles. above them was, here and there, a peak of snow. shades of mayne reid, they were the rockies--my old familiar rockies! have i been here before? what an absurd question, when i lived here for about ten years of my life in all the hours of dreamland. what deeds have i not done among redskins and trappers and grizzlies within their wilds! and here they were at last glimmering bright in the rising morning sun. at least, i have seen my dream mountains. most boys never do. jasper park is one of the great national playgrounds and health resorts which the canadian government with great wisdom has laid out for the benefit of the citizens. when canada has filled up and carries a large population, she will bless the foresight of the administrators who took possession of broad tracts of the most picturesque land and put them for ever out of the power of the speculative dealer. the national park at banff has for twenty years been a mecca for tourists. that at algonquin gives a great pleasure-ground to those who cannot extend their travels beyond eastern canada. but this new jasper park is the latest and the wildest of all these reserves. some years ago it was absolute wilderness, and much of it impenetrable. now, through the energy of colonel rogers, trails have been cut through it in various directions, and a great number of adventurous trips into country which is practically unknown can be carried out with ease and comfort. the packer plays the part of a dragoman in the east, arranging the whole expedition, food, cooking, and everything else on inclusive terms; and once in the hands of a first-class rocky mountain packer, a man of the standing of fred stephens or the otto brothers, the traveller can rely upon a square deal and the companionship of one whom he will find to be a most excellent comrade. there is no shooting in the park--it is a preserve for all wild animals--but there is excellent fishing, and everywhere there are the most wonderful excursions, where you sleep at night under the stars upon the balsamic fir branches which the packer gathers for your couch. i could not imagine an experience which would be more likely to give a freshet of vitality when the stream runs thin. for a week we lived the life of simplicity and nature. [illustration: the family in the wilds of canada.] the park is not as full of wild creatures as it will be after a few years of preservation. the indians who lived in this part rounded up everything that they could before moving to their reservation. but even now, the bear lumbers through the brushwood, the eagle soars above the lake, the timber wolf still skulks in the night, and the deer graze in the valleys. above, near the snow-line, the wild goat is not uncommon, while at a lower altitude are found the mountain sheep. on the last day of our visit the rare cinnamon bear exposed his yellow coat upon a clearing within a few hundred yards of the village. i saw his clumsy good-humoured head looking at me from over a dead trunk, and i thanked the kindly canadian law which has given him a place of sanctuary. what a bloodthirsty baboon man must appear to the lower animals! if any superhuman demon treated us exactly as we treat the pheasants, we should begin to reconsider our views as to what is sport. the porcupine is another creature which abounded in the woods. i did not see any, but a friend described an encounter between one and his dog. the creature’s quills are detachable when he wishes to be nasty, and at the end of the fight it was not easy to say which was the dog and which the porcupine. life in jasper interested me as an experience of the first stage of a raw canadian town. it will certainly grow into a considerable place, but at that time, bar colonel rogers’ house and the station, there were only log-huts and small wooden dwellings. christianity was apostolic in its simplicity and in its freedom from strife--though one has to go back remarkably early in apostolic times to find those characteristics. two churches were being built, the pastor in each case acting also as head mason and carpenter. one, the corner-stone of which i had the honour of laying, was to be used in turn by several nonconformist bodies. to the ceremony came the anglican parson, grimy from his labours on the opposition building, and prayed for the well-being of his rival. the whole function, with its simplicity and earnestness, carried out by a group of ill-clad men standing bareheaded in a drizzle of rain, seemed to me to have in it the essence of religion. as i ventured to remark to them, kikuyu and jasper can give some lessons to london. we made a day’s excursion by rail to the tête jaune cache, which is across the british columbian border and marks the watershed between east and west. here we saw the fraser, already a formidable river, rushing down to the pacific. at the head of the pass stands the village of the railway workers, exactly like one of the mining townships of bret harte, save that the bad man is never allowed to be too bad. there is a worse man in a red serge coat and a stetson hat, who is told off by the state to look after him, and does his duty in such fashion that the most fire-eating desperado from across the border falls into the line of law. but apart from the gunman, this village presented exactly the same queer cabins, strange signs, and gambling rooms which the great american master has made so familiar to us. and now we were homeward bound! back through edmonton, back through winnipeg, back through that young giant, fort william--but not back across the great lakes. instead of that transit we took train, by the courtesy of the canadian pacific, round the northern shore of superior, a beautiful wooded desolate country, which, without minerals, offers little prospect for the future. some 200 miles north of it, the grand trunk, that enterprising pioneer of empire, has opened up another line which extends for a thousand miles, and should develop a new corn and lumber district. canada is like an expanding flower; wherever you look you see some fresh petal unrolling. we spent three days at algonquin park. this place is within easy distance of montreal or ottawa, and should become a resort of british fishermen and lovers of nature. after all, it is little more than a week from london, and many a river in finland takes nearly as long to reach. there is good hotel accommodation, and out of the thousand odd lakes in this enormous natural preserve one can find all sorts of fishing, though the best is naturally the most remote. i had no particular luck myself, but my wife caught an eight-pound trout, which mr. bartlett, the courteous superintendent of the park, mounted, so as to confound all doubters. deer abound in the park, and the black bear is not uncommon, while wolves can often be heard howling in the night-time. what will be the destiny of canada? some people talk as if it were in doubt. personally, i have none upon the point. canada will remain exactly as she is for two more generations. at the end of that time there must be reconsideration of the subject, especially on the part of great britain, who will find herself with a child as large as herself under the same roof. i see no argument for the union of canada with the united states. there is excellent feeling between the two countries, but they could no more join at this period of their history than a great oak could combine with a well-rooted pine to make one tree. the roots of each are far too deep. it is impossible. then there is the alternative of canada becoming an independent nation. that is not so impossible as a union with the states, but it is in the last degree improbable. why should canada wish her independence? she has it now in every essential. but her first need is the capital and the population which will develop her enormous territory and resources. this capital she now receives from the mother-country to the extent in 1914 of 73 per cent, the united states finding 14 per cent, and canada herself the remaining 13. her dependence upon the mother-country for emigrants, though not so great as her financial dependence, is still the greatest from any single source. besides all this, she has the vast insurance policy, which is called the british navy, presented to her for nothing--though honour demands some premium from her in the future--and she has the british diplomatic service for her use unpaid. altogether, looking at it from the material side, canada’s interests lie deeply in the present arrangement. but there is a higher and more unselfish view which works even more strongly in the same direction. many of the most representative canadians are descendants of those united empire loyalists who in 1782 gave up everything and emigrated from the united states in order to remain under the flag. their imperialism is as warm or warmer than our own. and everywhere there is a consciousness of the glory of the empire, its magnificent future, and the wonderful possibilities of these great nations all growing up under the same flag with the same language and destinies. this sentiment joins with material advantages, and will prevent canada from having any aspiration towards independence. yes, it will remain exactly as it is for the remainder of this century. at the end of that time her population and resources will probably considerably exceed those of the mother land, and problems will arise which our children’s children may have some difficulty in solving. as to the french-canadian, he will always be a conservative force--let him call himself what he will. his occasional weakness for flying the french flag is not to be resented, but is rather a pathetic and sentimental tribute to a lost cause, like that which adorns every year the pedestal of charles at whitehall. i had some presentiment of coming trouble during the time we were in canada, though i never imagined that we were so close to the edge of a world-war. one incident which struck me forcibly was the arrival at vancouver of a ship full of sikhs who demanded to be admitted to canada. this demand was resisted on account of the immigration laws. the whole incident seemed to me to be so grotesque--for why should sun-loving hindoos force themselves upon canada--that i was convinced some larger purpose lay behind it. that purpose was, as we can now see, to promote discord among the races under the british flag. there can be no doubt that it was german money that chartered that ship. i had several opportunities of addressing large and influential canadian audiences, and i never failed to insist upon the sound state of the home population. the canadians judge us too often by our ne’er-do-weels and remittance men, who are the sample englishmen who come before them. in defence even of these samples it should be stated that they bulked very large in the first canadian division. i told the canadians of our magnificent boy scout movement, and also of the movement of old soldiers to form a national guard. “a country where both the old and the young can start new, unselfish, patriotic movements is a live country,” i said, “and if we are tested we will prove just as good as ever our fathers were.” i did not dream how near the test would be, how hard it would press, or how gloriously it would be met. and now i turn to the war, the physical climax of my life as it must be of the life of every living man and woman. each was caught as a separate chip and swept into that fearsome whirlpool, where we all gyrated for four years, some sinking for ever, some washed up all twisted and bent, and all of us showing in our souls and bodies some mark of the terrible forces which had controlled us so long. i will show presently how the war reacted upon me, and also, if one may speak without presumption, how in a minute way i in turn reacted upon the war. chapter xxvi the eve of war the prologue of armageddon--the “prince henry” race--bernhardi--“england and the next war”--“danger”--general sir h. wilson--the channel tunnel--naval defects--rubber collars--mines--willie redmond. for a long time i never seriously believed in the german menace. frequently i found myself alone, in a company of educated englishmen, in my opinion that it was non-existent--or at worst greatly exaggerated. this conclusion was formed on two grounds. the first was, that i knew it to be impossible that we could attack germany save in the face of monstrous provocation. by the conditions of our government, even if those in high places desired to do such a thing, it was utterly impracticable, for a foreign war could not be successfully carried on by great britain unless the overwhelming majority of the people approved of it. our foreign, like our home, politics are governed by the vote of the proletariat. it would be impossible to wage an aggressive war against any power if the public were not convinced of its justice and necessity. for this reason we could not attack germany. on the other hand, it seemed to be equally unthinkable that germany should attack us. one failed to see what she could possibly hope to gain by such a proceeding. she had enemies already upon her eastern and western frontiers, and it was surely unlikely that she would go out of her way to pick a quarrel with the powerful british empire. if she made war and lost it, her commerce would be set back and her rising colonial empire destroyed. if she won it, it was difficult to see where she could hope for the spoils. we could not give her greater facilities for trade than she had already. we could not give her habitable white colonies, for she would find it impossible to take possession of them in the face of the opposition of the inhabitants. an indemnity she could never force from us. some coaling stations and possibly some tropical colonies, of which latter she already possessed abundance, were the most that she could hope for. would such a prize as that be worth the risk attending such a war? to me it seemed that there could be only one answer to such a question. i am still of the same opinion. but unhappily the affairs of nations are not always regulated by reason, and occasionally a country may be afflicted by a madness which sets all calculations at defiance. then, again, i had looked upon the matter too much as between great britain and germany. i had not sufficiently considered the chance of our being drawn in against our will in order to safeguard belgium, or in order to stop the annihilation of france. it was so perfectly clear that britain by her treaty obligations, and by all that is human and honourable, would fight if belgium were invaded, that one could not conceive germany taking such a step with any other expectation. and yet what we could not conceive is exactly what happened, for it is clear that the delusions as to our degeneration in character had really persuaded the germans that the big cowardly fellow would stand by with folded arms and see his little friend knocked about by the bully. the whole idea showed an extraordinary ignorance of the british psychology, but absurd as it was, it was none the less the determining influence at the critical moment of the world’s history. the influence of the lie is one of the strangest problems of life--that which is not continually influences that which is. within one generation imagination and misrepresentation have destroyed the boer republics and imperial germany. one of my most remarkable pre-war experiences, which influenced my mind deeply, was my participation in the amateur motor race called the prince henry competition. it was rather a reliability test than a race, for the car had to go some 150 miles a day on an average at its own pace, but marks were taken off for all involuntary stoppages, breakdowns, accidents, etc. each owner had to drive his own car, and i had entered my little sixteen horse-power landaulette. there were about forty british cars and fifty german, so that the procession was a very considerable one. starting from homburg, the watering-place, our route ran through north germany, then by steamer to southampton, up to edinburgh and back to london by devious ways. the competition had been planned in germany, and there can be no doubt in looking back that a political purpose underlay it. the idea was to create a false entente by means of sport, which would react upon the very serious political development in the wind, namely, the occupation of agadir on the south-west coast of morocco, which occurred on our second day out. as prince henry, who organized and took part in the competition, was also head of the german navy, it is of course obvious that he knew that the _panther_ was going to agadir, and that there was a direct connection between the two events, in each of which he was a leading actor. it was a clumsy bit of stage management and could not possibly have been effective. the peculiarity of the tour was that each car had an officer of the army or navy of the other nation as a passenger, to check the marks. thus my wife and i had the enforced company for nearly three weeks of count carmer, rittmeister of breslau cuirassiers, who began by being stiff and inhuman, but speedily thawed and became a very good fellow. the arrangements were very peculiar. some british paper--the “mail” if i remember right--had stated that the competition was really a device to pass a number of german officers through great britain in order to spy out the land. i think there may have been some truth in this, as our good count when we reached london went off to a hotel down in the east end, which seemed a curious thing for a wealthy junker to do. this criticism seems to have annoyed the kaiser, and he said--or so it was reported--that none but junior officers should go as observers. i should think that ours was the senior of the lot, and the others were mostly captains and lieutenants. on the other hand, the british government, out of compliment to prince henry, had appointed the very best men available as observers. if there had been a sudden crisis over agadir, and germany had impounded us all, it would have been a national disaster and would have made a difference in a european war. speaking from an imperfect memory, i can recall that we had general grierson, charles munro, rawlinson, i think, captain--now general--swinton of tanks fame, delme ratcliffe, colonel--now general--holman, major--now general--thwaites, and many other notables both of the army and navy. from the first relations were strained. there was natural annoyance when these senior officers found that their opposite numbers were youngsters of no experience. then, again, at cologne and munster i understand that the german military did not show the proper courtesies, and certainly the hospitality which the whole party received until we reached england was negligible. the germans themselves must have felt ashamed of the difference. personally the competitors were not a bad set of fellows, though there were some bounders among them. we were not all above criticism ourselves. of the competition itself little need be said, as i have treated the sporting side of it elsewhere. some of the germans seemed to me to be a little mad, for they seemed consumed by the idea that it was a race, whereas it mattered nothing who was at the head of the procession or who at the tail, so long as you did the allotted distance in the allotted time. i saw a german bound into his car after some stoppage: “how many ahead? three englishmen! forwards! forwards!” he cried. they barged into each other, dashed furiously round corners, and altogether behaved in a wild fashion, while our sedate old fellows pursued their course in a humdrum fashion and saved their marks. there were, however, some good fellows among the germans. i have not forgotten how one of them, anonymously, used to place flowers in my wife’s corner every morning. but as an attempt at an entente it was a great failure. the british officer who was compelled to spend weeks with a carload of germans was not expansive and refused to be digested. some of the germans, too, became disagreeable. i saw a large german car--they were all benz and mercédès, generally 70-80 horse-power--edge a little british car right off the road on to the grass track beside it. the driver of the british car was a pretty useful middle-weight boxer, but he kept his temper or there might have been trouble. there was very little love lost on either side, though i, as one of the few german-speaking competitors, did my very best to bring about a more cordial atmosphere. but war was in the air. both sides spoke of it. several of the british officers were either of the intelligence branch, or had special german experience, and they were unanimous about it. my attempts towards peace were rejected. “the only thing i want to do with these people is to fight them,” said colonel holman. “same here,” said the officer with him. it was a deep antagonism on either side. they were not only sure of the war, but of the date. “it will be on the first pretext after the kiel canal is widened.” the kiel canal was finished in june, 1914, and war came in august, so that they were not far wrong. there was some little german chaff on the subject. “wouldn’t you like one of these little islands?” i heard a german say as we steamed out past heligoland and the frisian belt. it was this experience which first made me take the threat of war seriously, but i could have persuaded myself that i was misled, had it not been that i read soon afterwards bernhardi’s book “germany and the next war.” i studied it carefully and i put my impression of it into print in an article called “england and the next war,” which appeared in the “fortnightly review” in the summer of 1913. it lies before me now, as i write, and it is interesting to see how, as i projected my mind and my imagination over the possibilities of the future, i read much aright and some little wrong. i began by epitomizing bernhardi’s whole argument, and showing that, however we might disagree with it, we were bound to take it seriously, since he was undoubtedly a leader of a certain class of thought in his own country--that very military class which was now predominant. i demurred at his assumption that the german army in equal numbers must overcome the french. “it is possible,” i remarked, “that even so high an authority as general bernhardi has not entirely appreciated how germany has been the teacher of the world in military matters and how thoroughly her pupils have responded to that teaching. that attention to detail, perfection of arrangement for mobilization, and careful preparation which have won german victories in the past may now be turned against her, and she may find that others can equal her in her own virtues.” i then examined bernhardi’s alleged grievances against great britain, and showed how baseless they were, and how little they could hope to gain by victory. i quoted one poisonous sentence: “even english attempts at a _rapprochement_ must not blind us to the real situation. we may at most use them to delay the necessary and inevitable war until we may fairly imagine that we have some prospect of success.” “this last sentence,” i remarked, “must come home to some of us who have worked in the past for a better feeling between the two countries.” i then gave an epitome of bernhardi’s plan of campaign as outlined in charming frankness in his volume, and i sketched out how far we were in a position to meet it and what were the joints in our armour. my general conclusions may be given as follows:-- 1. that invasion was not a serious danger and that the thought of it should not deflect our plans. 2. that if invasion becomes impossible then any force like the territorials unless it is prepared to go abroad becomes useless. 3. that we should not have conscription save as a very last resource, since it is against the traditions of our people. 4. that our real danger lay in the submarine and in the airship, which could not be affected by blockade. in discussing the submarine i said: “what exact effect a swarm of submarines, lying off the mouth of the channel and the irish sea, would produce upon the victualling of these islands is a problem which is beyond my conjecture. other ships besides the british would be likely to be destroyed, and international complications would probably follow. i cannot imagine that such a fleet would entirely, or even to a very large extent, cut off our supplies. but it is certain that they would have the effect of considerably raising the price of whatever did reach us. therefore, we should suffer privation, though not necessarily such privation as would compel us to make terms. from the beginning of the war every home source would naturally be encouraged, and it is possible that before our external supplies were seriously decreased, our internal ones might be well on the way to make up the deficiency.” this did, i think, roughly outline the actual course of events. 5. that the submarines would affect military operations should we send a force to france or belgium. 6. that therefore the channel tunnel was a vital necessity. 7. that all unnecessary expenses should be at once cut down, so that british credit should stand at its highest when the strain came. these are only the general conclusions. the article attracted some attention, but i do not suppose that it had any actual influence upon the course of events. to reinforce it i wrote an imaginary episode called “danger” in the “strand magazine,” to show how even a small power might possibly bring us to our knees by the submarine. it was singularly prophetic, for not only did it outline the actual situation as it finally developed, but it contained many details, the zig-zagging of the merchant ships, the use of submarine guns, the lying for the night on sandy bottoms, and so forth--exactly as they occurred. the article was sent round in proof to a number of high naval officers, mostly retired, for their opinions. i am afraid that the printed results, which i will not be so cruel as to quote, showed that it was as well they _were_ retired, since they had no sense of the possibilities of the naval warfare of the future. one result of my “fortnightly” article was that general henry wilson, late chief of the staff college as he then was, desired to see me to cross-question me, and a meeting was arranged at the house of colonel sackville-west, major swinton being also present. there, after luncheon, general wilson machine-gunned me with questions for about an hour. he was fierce and explosive in his manner, and looked upon me, no doubt, as one of those pestilential laymen who insist upon talking of things they don’t understand. as i could give reasons for my beliefs, i refused to be squashed, and when the interview was over i went straight down to the athenæum club and wrote it all down from memory. it makes such curious reading that i give it exactly as i reported it that day, in dialogue, with one or two comments from colonel sackville-west. after saying with some asperity that i had made many statements which i could not substantiate, and so might give the public far too optimistic a view of the position, he said: “why do you say that we would never pay an indemnity to germany?” a. c. d. it is a matter of individual opinion. i go upon history and upon the spirit of our people. gen. w. had not france equal spirit in 1870? how is it that they paid an indemnity? a. c. d. because germany was sitting on top of them, and she had to pay to get from under. gen. w. why may she not sit on top of us? a. c. d. because we live on an island and she cannot occupy us in the same way. colonel s.-w. i believe a little pressure on london would cause us to pay an indemnity. a. c. d. the man who suggested it would get hanged. colonel s.-w. they would hang the man who made the war. a. c. d. no, they would back him but hang the traitor. gen. w. you say that they would gain nothing by war. what about the carrying trade of the world? a. c. d. the carrying trade depends on economic questions and upon geographical situation. for example, the norwegians, who have no fleet, are one of the principal carriers. gen. w. at least they could starve us out if they held the seas. a. c. d. well, that is where my tunnel would come in; but of course i am entirely with you as to the need of holding the seas. gen. w. well, now, you admit that we must go to the help of france? a. c. d. certainly. gen. w. but what can six divisions do? a. c. d. well, my point is that six divisions with a tunnel are better than six divisions without a tunnel. colonel s.-w. if we have a tunnel we must have a force worth sending to send through it. a. c. d. if you are going to couple the tunnel with compulsory service, you will get neither one nor the other. gen. w. i think, so far as submarines go, that the british patrols would make it a very desperate service. some desperate man might get his boat through. a. c. d. some desperate man might command a flotilla and get it through. gen. w. many things seem possible theoretically which cannot be done in practice, but no doubt there is a danger there. in your view the territorials are simply a support for the fighting army? a. c. d. yes. gen. w. but they are too untrained to go into action. a. c. d. they would be reserves and have time to train. gen. w. your idea of troops coming back in case of a raid through the tunnel is impossible. you could not withdraw troops in that way from their positions. a. c. d. well, with all respect, i do not believe either in a raid or in an invasion. gen. w. a war with germany would be short and sharp--seven months would see it finished. a. c. d. you mean, no doubt, the continental part. i could imagine the naval part lasting ten years. colonel s.-w. if your fleet was crushed, you would have to give in. a. c. d. a fleet can never be annihilated as an army is. there always remain scattered forces which can go on fighting. i don’t think we need give in because the fleet is crushed. gen. w. you don’t suppose that the englishman is a better soldier by nature than the frenchman or the german? a. c. d. at least he is a volunteer. gen. w. how would that affect the matter? a. c. d. i think he would rally better if he were beaten. there would be no end to his resistance, like the north in the american war. gen. w. don’t you think, if war were declared with germany, that the public, fearing an invasion, would clamour against any regular troops going abroad at all? a. c. d. i think the public would leave it to the war office. in the south african war they allowed our troops to go 6,000 miles away, and yet there was a danger of a european coalition. colonel s.-w. but our navy was supreme then. a. c. d. not against a coalition. gen. w. when cervera’s fleet got loose, the americans would not allow their troops to embark. colonel s.-w. even the pacific coast was terrified. a. c. d. well, surely that is the _reductio ad absurdum_. colonel s.-w. still, the fact remains. gen. w. if we could send fifteen divisions we could stop a war. a. c. d. but that means compulsory service. gen. w. why not? a. c. d. because i am convinced that you could not get it. i have twice stood for parliament, and i am sure no candidate would have a chance on such a platform. gen. w. our descendants will say, “well, you saw the danger, and yet you made no effort.” a. c. d. well, we have doubled our estimates. surely that is an effort and must represent power somewhere. we parted quite good friends, but the general’s evident desire to rope me in as a compulsory-service man was vain. i venture to think that lord roberts’ efforts in that direction were a great mistake, and that if he had devoted the same great energy to the line of least resistance, which was the territorial force, we could have had half a million in the ranks when war broke out. from the time that i was convinced by my experiences at the prince henry race and by carefully reading german literature that a war was really brewing, i naturally began to speculate as to the methods of attack and of defence. i have an occasional power of premonition, psychic rather than intellectual, which exercises itself beyond my own control, and which when it really comes is never mistaken. the danger seems to be that my own prejudice or reasonings may interfere with it. on this occasion i saw as clearly as possible what the course of a naval war between england and germany would be. i had no doubt at all that our greatest danger--a desperately real one--was that they would use their submarines in order to sink our food ships, and that we might be starved into submission. even if we won every fleet action, this unseen enemy would surely bring us to our knees. it all worked out in exact detail in my mind--so much so that admiral capelle mentioned my name afterwards in the reichstag, and said that only i had accurately seen the economic form which the war would assume. this was perhaps true, so far as the economic side went, but sir percy scott had spoken with far more authority than i on the growing power of the submarines in warfare. i was made very uneasy by this line of thought, and all the more so because i asked several naval officers for some reassurance and could get none. one of them, i remember, said that it was all right because we should put a boom across the channel, which seemed to me like saying that you could keep eels from going down a river by laying a plank across it. among others i spoke to captain beatty, as he then was, whom i met at a week-end party at knole, and though he could give me no reassurance about submarines he impressed me by his vivid and alert personality, and i felt that a navy with such men in command was safe enough where fighting was concerned. it could not, however, fill the platter if there was no loaf to place upon it. i pondered the matter, and could only see three palliatives, and no cure. the first was to encourage home growth by a bonus or by a tariff. but here our accursed party politics barred the way, as i had learned only too clearly after spending a thousand pounds in fighting the hawick burghs in order to get some form of agricultural protection. the second was to meet submarines by submarine food-carriers. i think that this may prove the final solution, but the ships were not yet planned, far less launched. the third and most obvious was the channel tunnel, or tunnels for preference. i had supported this scheme for years, and felt that as a nation we had made fools of ourselves over it, exactly as we did over the suez canal. if we were an island the size of the wight such timidity would be intelligible, but the idea of a great country being invaded through a hole in the ground twenty-seven miles long seemed to me the most fantastic possible, while the practical use of the tunnel both for trade and for tourists was obvious. but now i saw that far more serious issues were at stake, for if we were held up by submarines, and if france was either neutral or our ally, we could land all the eastern portion of our supplies, which is not inconsiderable, at marseilles and so run them safely to london without breaking bulk. when i put this forward in the press some military critic said: “but if the submarines could hold up the channel they could hold up the mediterranean also.” this did not seem a good argument, because germany was the possible enemy and it had no port in the mediterranean, while the radius of submarine action at that time was not great enough to allow them to come so far. so strongly did i feel about the need for a channel tunnel in view of the coming war that i remember writing three memoranda and sending one to the army, one to the navy, and one to the council of imperial defence. of course i got no satisfaction of any kind, but captain--now general--swinton, who was acting as secretary to the latter body, told me that he had read my paper and that it had “set him furiously thinking.” i wrote to lord northcliffe also, without avail. i felt as if, like solomon eagle, i could go through london with a burning brazier on my head, if i could only get people to understand the need of the tunnel. the whole discussion had taken the utterly impossible and useless turn towards compulsory service, and the things which were practical and vital were being missed. i spoke in public about the tunnel when i could, and on one occasion, just a year before the war, i raised a discussion in “the times,” mr. ronald mcneill giving me an opening by declaring in the house that the project was a crazy one. there was also about that time a meeting in the city at the cannon street hotel, where a very influential body of men supported the scheme. my speech, as reported next day in “the times” in a very condensed form, ran thus: “sir a. conan doyle said there were possibilities in a future war that rendered it a matter of vital national importance that the tunnel should be constructed without delay. the danger was that we were getting five-sixths of our food supplies from abroad, and submarine craft were developing remarkable qualities which were not generally realized. they were able to avoid a blockade squadron, and to pass under a patrol line of torpedo-boats without their existence being even suspected. if they were sent to the line of our commerce and told to sink a ship, they would torpedo that ship for a certainty. what would be the condition of our food supplies if there were twenty-five hostile submarines off the kent coast and twenty-five in the irish channel? the price of food would reach an almost prohibitive figure. the military correspondent of ‘the times’ was a great opponent of the channel tunnel and was always running it down and mocking at it. but the other day he wrote an article on the mediterranean, and, forgetting the channel tunnel, he said: ‘we must remember that more than half the food supply of this country now comes from the mediterranean.’ if it came through the mediterranean, and if it got to marseilles and we had the channel tunnel, it was only a matter of management to get it through to london.” the military correspondent of “the times,” who was presumably colonel repington, had an article next day deriding the scheme, and making light of my picture of submarines in the channel. well, we have lived to see them, and i wish my argument had proved less sound. colonel repington has proved himself so clear-sighted an observer and commentator in the last war that he can be forgiven if, for once, he was on the wrong side; but if the channel tunnel had been put in hand at once after that meeting and rushed to completion, i wonder if it would be an exaggeration to say that a hundred million pounds would have been saved, while what it would have meant in evacuating wounded and in communications in stormy weather could not be represented in words. imagine the convenience and saving of time and labour when munitions could be started at woolwich and landed at amiens without a break. it has been argued that if the tunnel had been built the first swoop of the germans would have brought them to the end of it and it would have been destroyed. but this will not bear examination, for it is based on the idea that we should have left the end unprotected. it would as a matter of fact have been the most natural fortress in the world, the strongest and the strangest, for it would be the only fortress where you could increase or withdraw your garrison at will, and introduce any supplies at any time you might desire. a very few forts and trenches on those convenient chalk slopes with their wide, smooth fields of fire, would hold the tunnel. in stretching their right wing as far as amiens the germans were very nearly cut off, and it was by a very great effort that von kluck saved it. if instead of amiens he had reached calais with sufficient forces for a siege he would have been unable to get away. an argument based upon the supposition that we should leave the mouth of the tunnel in picardy as unprotected as the mouth of a coal mine in kent is surely an unsound one. now, in 1924, they are talking of building the tunnel. i wonder what our descendants will think of the whole business--probably what we think of the men who opposed the suez canal. it is a most singular thing that our navy, with so many practical and clever men in it, with a genius like winston churchill at the head, and another genius like lord fisher in continual touch, did not realize, until faced with actual results, some of the most important and surely most obvious points in connection with naval warfare. it came, i suppose, from the iron bonds of tradition, and that there were so many things to supervise, but the fact remains that a perfectly overwhelming case could be made out against the higher brain department of our senior service. a war with germany was anticipated, and, as the public imagined, was prepared for, but save for the ship-building programme, which left us a narrow margin of safety, and for the concentration of our distant squadrons into british waters and the elimination of many useless craft which consumed good crews, what evidence is there of foresight? it was known, for example, that scapa flow and cromarty were the two possible anchorages of the fleet in a long-distance blockade, and yet no attempt had been made to mount guns or to net the entrances, so that for months there was a possibility of a shattering disaster; and jellicoe, with the prudence which always distinguished him, had to put to sea every night lest his fleet should present a sitter to a torpedo attack. we showed intelligence in sticking always to the heavier guns, but our mines were wretchedly inefficient, our range-finders were very inferior, and our shells proved to have less penetrating and explosive force. but the worst thing of all was the utter want of imagination shown in picturing the conditions of modern naval warfare, which must surely be done before just preparation can be made. it was clear that the effect of armour protection on one side, and of the mine and the torpedo on the other, would mean that if the ship floated there would be little loss of life, but that she was very likely to sink, in which case the whole crew would go. therefore provision must be made for the saving of every one on board. the authorities, however, seem to have completely underrated the dangers of the mine and torpedo, and centred their attention upon the surface naval action, where boats, being inflammable, would be a danger and where in any case they would probably be shot to pieces before the end of the fight. the pre-war idea was to throw the boats and every other wooden object overboard before the action began. the very first day of naval warfare showed the importance of the mine, as on august 5 the germans laid a minefield outside the mouth of the thames which nearly blew up their own returning ambassador, prince lichnowsky, and did actually cause the destruction of one of our light vessels, the _amphion_. it was clear that one of the great dangers of the sea lay in this direction, and it soon became equally clear that nothing had been done to think out some defence. foresight would have anticipated this situation and would have set the brains of the younger naval officers at work devising some remedy. as a matter of fact the real solution had been roughly indicated by colonel repington in “blackwood’s magazine” some four years before, in which he spoke of a device called “the otter” used by poachers for gathering up lines, and suggested that something of the sort would gather up the lines to which mines are attached. after three years of war, and very many preventable losses, including the great battleship _audacious_, the splendid auxiliary cruiser _laurentic_ with six millions in gold on board, and many other fine vessels, the cure was found in the paravane, which was an adaptation of “the otter.” after its adoption ships could cruise over a minefield with little fear of injury, and our squadrons were no longer confined to the narrow lanes which had been swept clear. i was from the beginning greatly impressed by this danger, and i wrote early in the war both to the papers and the admiralty, but my device was crude and clumsy compared to what was actually done. my idea was something like a huge trident or toasting fork which could be hauled up on the bows when the waters were safe, but could be pushed forward and dipped down in front when there was danger, so as to explode any mine before the ship could actually reach it. such an apparatus would be better than nothing, but still i quite admit that it was an inadequate solution of the problem. but at least it was an attempt--and no other attempt was visible for years afterwards. but the particular instance of mines was a small consideration beside the huge permanent incredible fact that while it was clear that a battleship could suddenly go down like a kettle with a hole in it, dragging a thousand men down with it, there was no provision by which the lives of these men could be saved. it was really unbelievable until there came the terrible example when the three cruisers, _hogue_, _aboukir_, and _cressy_, were all put down in a single day. a young german lieutenant with twenty men had caused us more loss than we suffered at trafalgar. to learn how the helpless men had nowhere to turn, and how they clung on to floating petrol tins as their only safety, should have been terrible reading to those whose want of foresight had brought about such a situation. it was a dreadful object-lesson, and there seemed no reason why it should not be often repeated. i had already commented in the press upon the situation which would arise in a general action, with ships sinking all round and no boats. i suggested that it might be possible to drop the boats before battle and to have them in tow of a steam launch which could bring them up if needed. of course i saw all the difficulties and dangers of such a course, but if one took the word of the sailors that the boats were a danger on board then i could think of no other way of working it. when i wrote about it, several naval critics, notably commander jane, rapped me hard over the knuckles, and deplored the intrusion of landsmen into matters of which they knew nothing. but when this great catastrophe occurred, i realized that the protection must be individual rather than collective, and that one must ventilate the thing in public with such warmth that the authorities would be compelled to do something. if wooden boats were impossible, what about india-rubber collars which would at least hold the poor fellows above the waves until some help could reach them? i opened an agitation in several papers, notably the “daily mail” and the “daily chronicle,” and within a very few days--either _post hoc_ or _propter hoc_--there was a rush order for a quarter of a million collars which could be blown out by the men themselves, and which were henceforth to be part of their vital equipment. the “hampshire telegraph,” the best informed of naval papers, said: “the navy has to thank sir conan doyle for the new life-saving apparatus the admiralty are supplying. some weeks ago he asked if it was not possible to manufacture a simple and easily inflatable life-belt, and, thanks to the enterprise of a rubber-manufacturing firm, a swimming collar is now being supplied to the men of the fleet in the north sea as fast as they can be turned out. the apparatus is exceedingly simple. it is made of rubber, enclosed in a stout web casing, and weighs complete under three ounces. it can be carried in the pocket and can be inflated in position round a man’s neck in about ten seconds. its effect is to keep the man’s head above water indefinitely. there is little doubt that this swimming collar will result in the saving of many lives, and the admiralty are to be congratulated upon the promptitude with which they have adopted the suggestion of sir conan doyle.” i was by no means satisfied with this, however; for, however useful in calm water on a summer day, it was clear that men would soon perish by exhaustion in a rough winter sea, and the collars would only prolong their agony. if wooden boats took up too much room and were inflammable, how about india-rubber collapsible boats? i wrote in the “daily mail”: “we can spare and replace the ships. we cannot spare the men. they _must_ be saved, and this is how to save them. there is nothing so urgent as this. we can view all future disasters with equanimity if the ship’s company has only a fair chance for its life.” of course one recognized that there were some situations where nothing would avail. the _formidable_, which was torpedoed near plymouth on january 1, 1915, was a case in point. captain miller, of the brixham trawler which rescued seventy men, said to the “daily mail” representative that i was doing a national work in my efforts to get better life-saving appliances for the men of the navy. he remarked that in calm weather collapsible boats would be of use, but they could not possibly have lived in the seas which were breaking over the _formidable’s_ whaler. the weather here was exceptional, and one cannot hope to provide for every case. the final result of the agitation was the provision of collars, of safety waistcoats, and (as i believe) of a better supply of boats. i need hardly say that i never received a word of acknowledgment or thanks from the admiralty. one is not likely to be thanked by a government department for supplementing its work. but it may be that some poor seaman struggling in the water sent me his good wish, and those are the thanks that i desired. there was nothing in the war which moved me more than the thought of the helpless plight of these gallant men who were sacrificed when they could so easily have been saved. like every man with irish blood in his veins, i was deeply moved by the tragedy of ireland during the war--her fine start, the want of tact with which it was met, her sad relapse, and finally her failure to rise to the great world crisis. a letter which i value very much is one which i received from major william redmond just before his lamented death. what an abyss of evil ireland would have been saved from had the spirit of this letter been the inspiration upon which she acted! 18.12.16. dear sir arthur conan doyle,-- it was very good of you to write to me and i value very much the expression of your opinion. there are a great many irishmen to-day who feel that out of this war we should try and build up a new ireland. the trouble is men are so timid about meeting each other half-way. it would be a fine memorial to the men who have died so splendidly, if we could over their graves build up a bridge between the north and south. i have been thinking a lot about this lately in france--no one could help doing so when one finds that the two sections from ireland are actually _side_ by _side_ holding the trenches! no words--not even your own--could do justice to the splendid action of the new irish soldiers. they never have flinched. they never give trouble, and they are steady and sober. had poor kettle lived he would have given the world a wonderful account of things out there. i saw a good deal of kettle, and we had many talks of the unity we both hoped would come out of the war. i have been an extreme nationalist all my life, and if others as extreme, perhaps, on the other side will only come half-way, then i believe, impossible as it may seem, we should be able to hit upon a plan to satisfy the irish sentiment and the imperial sentiment at one and the same time. i am sure you can do very much, as you already have done, in this direction. i am going back for christmas with the men i have become attached very deeply to during the last two years. with many thanks for your letter, yours very truly, william redmond. major. if this letter, even now, were posted up by the free state and northern governments at every cross-roads of ireland the spirit of willie redmond might heal the wounds of the unhappy country. chapter xxvii a remembrance of the dark years nightmares of the morning--the civilian reserve--the volunteers--domestic life in war time--german prisoners--cipher to our prisoners--sir john french--empress eugenie--miracle town--armour--our tragedy. i can never forget, and our descendants can never imagine, the strange effect upon the mind which was produced by seeing the whole european fabric drifting to the edge of the chasm with absolute uncertainty as to what would happen when it toppled over. military surprises, starvation, revolution, bankruptcy--no one knew what so unprecedented an episode would produce. it was all so evidently preventable, and yet it was so madly impossible to prevent it, for the prussians had stuck their monkey-wrench into the machinery and it would no longer work. as a rule one has wild dreams and wakes to sanity, but on those mornings i left sanity when i woke and found myself in a world of nightmare dreams. on august 4, when war seemed assured, i had a note from mr. goldsmith, a plumber in the village: “there is a feeling in crowborough that something should be done.” this made me laugh at first, but presently i thought more seriously of it. after all, crowborough was one of a thousand villages, and we might be planning and acting for all. therefore i had notices rapidly printed. i distributed them and put them at road corners, and the same evening (august 4) we held a village meeting and started the volunteers, a force which soon grew to 200,000 men. the old volunteers had become extinct when the territorials had been organized some ten or twelve years before. but this new force which i conceived was to be a universal one, where every citizen, young and old, should be trained to arms--a great stockpot into which the nation could dip and draw its needs. we named ourselves the civilian reserve. no one, i reflected, could be the worse in such days for being able to drill and to shoot, or for being assembled in organized units. government was too preoccupied to do anything, and we must show initiative for ourselves. after i had propounded my scheme, i signed the roll myself, and 120 men did the same. those were the first men in the volunteer force. next evening we assembled at the drill-hall, found out who could drill us, chose our non-commissioned officers and set to work to form ourselves into an efficient company. gillette, my american actor friend, had got stranded in england, and he was an interested spectator on this occasion. for the time being i took command. i had notified the war office what we had done and asked for official sanction. we were careful not to stand in the way of recruiting and determined to admit none who could reasonably join up at once. when the plan began to work i wrote a description of our methods to “the times.” as a consequence i received requests for our rules and methods from 1,200 towns and villages. my secretary and i worked all day getting these off, and in many cases the inquiries led to the formation of similar companies. for about a fortnight all went well. we drilled every day, though we had no weapons. at the end of that time there came a peremptory order from the war office: “all unauthorized bodies to be at once disbanded.” unquestioning and cheerful obedience is the first law in time of war. the company was on parade. i read out the telegram and then said: “right turn! dismiss!” with this laconic order the civilian reserve dissolved for ever. but it had a speedy and glorious resurrection. there was a central body in london with some remote connection with the old volunteer force. lord desborough was chairman of this, and there could not have been a better man. the government put the formation of a volunteer force into the charge of this committee, to which i was elected. mr. percy harris was the secretary and showed great energy. i wrote to all the 1,200 applicants referring them to this new centre, and we, the crowborough body, now became the crowborough company of the sixth royal sussex volunteer regiment. that we were the first company in the country was shown by the “volunteer gazette” when a prize was awarded for this distinction. under its new shape captain st. quintin, who had been a soldier, became our leader, and mr. gresson and mr. druce, both of them famous cricketers, our lieutenants. goldsmith was one of the sergeants, and i remained a full private for four years of war, and an extra half-year before we were demobilized. our ranks fluctuated, for as the age limit of service gradually rose we passed many men into the regular army, but we filled up with new recruits, and we were always about a hundred strong. our drill and discipline were excellent, and when we received our rifles and bayonets we soon learned to use them, nor were our marching powers contemptible when one remembers that many of the men were in the fifties and even in the sixties. it was quite usual for us to march from crowborough to frant, with our rifles and equipment, to drill for a long hour in a heavy marshy field, and then to march back, singing all the way. it would be a good fourteen miles, apart from the drill. i have very pleasant recollections of that long period of service. i learned to know my neighbours who stood in the same ranks, and i hope that they also learned to know me as they could not otherwise. we had frequent camps, field days and inspections. on one occasion 8,000 of us were assembled, and i am bound to say that i have never seen a finer body of men, though they were rather of the police-constable than of the purely military type. the spirit was excellent, and i am sure that if we had had our chance we should have done well in action. but it was hard to know how to get the chance save in case of invasion. we were the remaining pivots of national life, and could only be spared for short periods or chaos would follow. but a week or two in case of invasion was well within our powers, and such a chance would have been eagerly hailed. no doubt our presence enabled the government to strip the country of regular troops far more than they would have dared otherwise to do. twice, as repington’s “memoirs” show, there was a question of embodying us for active service, but in each case the emergency passed. i found the life of a private soldier a delightful one. to be led and not to lead was most restful, and so long as one’s thoughts were bounded by the polishing of one’s buttons and buckles, or the cleansing of one’s rifle, one was quietly happy. in that long period i shared every phase of my companions’ life. i have stood in the queue with my pannikin to get a welcome drink of beer, and i have slept in a bell-tent on a summer night with a sussex yokel blissfully snoring upon each of my shoulders. sometimes amusing situations arose. i remember a new adjutant arriving and reviewing us. when he got opposite to me in his inspection, his eyes were caught by my south african medal. “you have seen service, my man,” said he. “yes, sir,” i answered. he was a little cocky fellow who might well have been my son so far as age went. when he had passed down the line, he said to our c.o., st. quintin: “who is that big fellow on the right of the rear rank?” “that’s sherlock holmes,” said c.o. “good lord!” said the adjutant, “i hope he does not mind my ‘my manning’ him!” “he just loves it,” said st. quintin, which showed that he knew me. the other big factor which covered the whole period of the war, and some time after it, was my writing the history of the european campaign, which i published volume by volume under the name of “the british campaign in france and flanders.” my information was particularly good, for i had organized a very extensive correspondence with the generals, who were by no means anxious for self-advertisement, but were, on the other hand, very keen that the deeds of their particular troops should have full justice done them. in this way i was able to be the first to describe in print the full battle-line with all the divisions, and even brigades in their correct places from mons onwards to the last fight before the armistice. when i think what a fuss was made in the old days when any correspondent got the account of a single colonial battle before his comrades, it is amazing to me that hardly a single paper ever commented, in reviewing these six successive volumes, upon the fact that i was really the only public source of supply of accurate and detailed information. i can only suppose that they could not believe it to be true. i had no help but only hindrance from the war office, and everything i got was by means which were equally open to anyone else who took the trouble to organize them. of course, i was bowdlerized and blue-pencilled by censors, but still the fact remains that a dozen great battle-lines were first charted by me. i have since read the official account so far as it has gone, and find little to change in my own, though the german and french records are now available to broaden the picture. for the moment war literature is out of fashion, and my war history, which reflects all the passion and pain of those hard days, has never come into its own. i would reckon it the greatest and most undeserved literary disappointment of my life if i did not know that the end is not yet and that it may mirror those great times to those who are to come. for the rest i had a great deal of literary propaganda work to do. once it was the “to arms!” pamphlet written in conjunction with mr. smith, soon to become lord birkenhead. once again it was an appeal for our ill-used prisoners. sometimes norway, sometimes south america, always the united states, needed treatment. as to my special missions, those i treat in separate chapters. there are many small but very important details of domestic life during the war which have never been properly described, and could indeed best be described by a woman, for they were usually an invasion of her department. our descendants will never realize how we were all registered and docketed and rationed, so that the state could give the least to and take the most from each of us. one had food-cards for practically everything, and the card only entitled you to get your meagre portion if it was to be had. often it wasn’t. i have been at a great lunch with half the grandees of the land, and the prime minister to speak. the fare was irish stew and rice-pudding. what could man ask for more, but it will need another war to bring it round again. there was a pleasing uncertainty about all meals. there was always a sense of adventure and a wonder whether you would really get something. it all made for appetite. then there were the darkened windows, the sharp knocking of the police if the blind emitted any light, the vexatious summons for very small offences, the pulling down of every blind on the railway trains. at night one never knew what evil bird was flying overhead or what foul egg would be dropped. once, as we sat in the theatre at eastbourne, the whirr of a zeppelin was heard above us. half the audience slipped out, the lights were put out, and the play was finished with candles on the stage. when i was lecturing in london the same thing happened, and i finished my lecture in the dark. every one found themselves doing strange things. i was not only a private in the volunteers, but i was a signaller and i was for a time number one of a machine gun. my wife started a home for belgian refugees in crowborough. my son was a soldier, first, last, and all the time. my daughter mary gave herself up altogether to public work, making shells at vickers and afterwards serving in a canteen. if i may quote a passage from my history: “grotesque combinations resulted from the eagerness of all classes to lend a hand. an observer has described how a peer and a prize-fighter worked on the same bench at woolwich, while titled ladies and young girls from cultured homes earned sixteen shillings a week at erith and boasted in the morning of the number of shell-cases which they had turned, and finished in their hours of night-shift. truly it had become a national war. of all its memories none will be stranger than those of the peaceful middle-aged civilians who were seen eagerly reading books of elementary drill in order to prepare themselves to meet the most famous soldiers in europe, or of the schoolgirls and matrons who donned blue blouses and by their united work surpassed the output of the great death factories of essen.” every house had its vegetable garden and every poor man his allotment, that we might at the worst exist until we could win our peace. the want of sugar and the limitation of tea were the worst privations. my wife, greatly helped by a faithful servant, jakeman, did wonders in saving food, and we always lived well within our legal rations. this did not save us once from a police raid, because some tea, sent us as a present from india, had arrived. we had already distributed a good deal of it, however, to our less fortunate neighbours, so we came well out of the matter. i have one singular memory in having to guard german prisoners at work. the volunteers had a turn at this work, and we spent the night at lewes prison. in the early morning, dark and misty, we were mustered, and five prisoners handed over to each of us. mine worked on a farm some four miles from the town, and thither i had to march them, walking behind them with my rifle on my shoulder. when i had reached the lonely country road, i thought i would get into human touch with these poor slouching wretches, who were still in their stained grey uniforms, and wearing their service caps with the bright red bands which formed a wonderful advertisement of the excellence of german dyes. i halted them, drew them up, and asked them their nationality. three were from wurtemburg and two from prussia. i asked the wurtemburgers how long they had been prisoners. they said, “fourteen months.” “then,” said i, “you were taken by the canadians at ypres upon such and such a date.” they were considerably astonished, since i was simply a second-line tommy from their point of view. of course, i had the details of the war very clearly in my mind, and i knew that our one big haul of wurtemburgers had been on that occasion. to this day they must wonder how i knew. i shall not forget that day, for i stood for eight hours leaning on a rifle, amid drizzling rain, while in a little gap of the mist i watched those men loading carts with manure. i can answer for it that they were excellent workers, and they seemed civil, tractable fellows as well. it was in 1915 that i managed to establish a secret correspondence with the british prisoners at magdeburg. it was not very difficult to do, and i dare say others managed it as well as i, but it had the effect of cheering them by a little authentic news, for at that time they were only permitted to see german newspapers. it came about in this way. a dear friend of my wife’s, miss lily loder symonds, had a brother, captain willie loder symonds, of the wiltshires, who had been wounded and taken in the stand of the 7th brigade on the evening before le cateau. he was an ingenious fellow and had written home a letter which passed the german censor, because it seemed to consist in the description of a farm, but when read carefully it was clear that it was the conditions of himself and his comrades which he was discussing. it seemed to me that if a man used such an artifice he would be prepared for a similar one in a letter from home. i took one of my books, therefore, and beginning with the third chapter--i guessed the censor would examine the first--i put little needle-pricks under the various printed letters until i had spelled out all the news. i then sent the book and also a letter. in the letter i said that the book was, i feared, rather slow in the opening, but that from chapter iii onwards he might find it more interesting. that was as plain as i dared to make it. loder symonds missed the allusion altogether, but by good luck he showed the letter to captain the hon. rupert keppel, of the guards, who had been taken at landrecies. he smelled a rat, borrowed the book, and found my cipher. a message came back to his father, lord albemarle, to the effect that he hoped conan doyle would send some more books. this was sent on to me, and of course showed me that it was all right. from that time onwards every month or two i pricked off my bulletin, and a long job it was. finally, i learned that the british papers were allowed for the prisoners, so that my budget was superfluous. however, for a year or two i think it was some solace to them, for i always made it as optimistic as truth would allow--or perhaps a little more so, just to get the average right. i had some dealings with general french, but only one interview with him. no one can help feeling a deep respect for the soldier who relieved kimberley and headed off cronje, or for the man who bore the first hard thrust of the german spear. my only interview with the general was at the horse guards, when he talked very clearly about the military position, though most of what he said as to the changes which modern tactics and heavy guns had caused was rather self-evident. “your problem always is how to pass the wire and the machine guns. there is no way round. what is the good of talking of invading austria from the south? you will find the same wire and the same machine guns. we may as well face it in flanders as anywhere else.” this talk was shortly after loos, when he had returned from the army and was at the head of home defence. “if you want any point looked up for your history, mind you let me know and i will see that it is done.” this sounded very nice to me, who was in a perpetual state of wanting to know; but as a matter of fact i took it as a mere empty phrase, and so it proved when a week or two later i put it to the test. it was a simple question, but i never got any clear answer. one pleasing incident occurred in 1917, when a hull steam trawler which had been named after me, under the able handling of skipper addy and lieutenant mccabe of the naval reserve, had an action with a heavily armed modern submarine, the fight lasting for some hours. the _conan doyle_ was acting as flagship of a little group of trawlers, and though their guns were popguns compared with that of the german, they so peppered him that he was either sunk or took flight--anyhow, he vanished under the water. the little boat sent me its ship’s bell as a souvenir of the exploit, and i sent some small remembrances in exchange. it was a fine exploit, and i was proud to be connected with it, even in so remote a way. i have in my war chapters expressed my admiration for general haig. on one occasion i called upon lady haig, when she was administering some private hospital at farnborough. it was, so far as i could understand, one wing of the empress eugenie’s house, and the empress invited me to lunch. there were present also prince victor napoleon and his wife, who was, i think, a daughter of my old aversion, leopold, king of the belgians and overlord of the congo. the empress interested me deeply--a historical relic whom one would expect to study in old pictures and memoirs, yet there she was moving and talking before me. if helen launched a thousand ships, eugenie, by all accounts, did far more. indeed, if the first german war was really from her inspiration, as zola insists, she was at the root of all modern history. in spite of her great age, her face and figure preserved the lines of elegance and breed, the features clearly cut, the head set proudly upon the long neck. i glanced into her sitting-room as i passed the open door and noticed that she was engaged upon an enormous jig-saw puzzle, a thousand pieces if there were one. children’s toys engaged the mind which once played with empires. there is surely something fatal in that spanish blood with its narrow fanatical religion and its masterful intolerance, magnificent but mediæval like the church which inspires it. she talked very freely with me and in the most interesting manner. it was surprising to see how fresh her mind was, and what curious information she had at her command. she told me, for example, that tetanus in france depended very much upon what soil had got into the wound, while that in turn depended upon what manures had been used for the soil--thus the percentage of tetanus cases would be quite different in a vine-growing district and in one where ordinary crops were cultivated. she spoke seriously about the war, but was confident as to the ultimate result. this graceful, withered flower in its strange setting was one of the outstanding memories of those days. all sorts of queer odd jobs came to me as to many others in the war. i was, of course, prepared always to do absolutely anything which was suggested, though the suggestions were sometimes not very reasonable. one must not argue, but simply put one’s whole weight, for what it is worth, into the scrum. once i was directed to go up to scotland and write up the great new munition works at gretna, as the public needed reassurance upon the point. pearson, the younger brother of lord cowdray, had built them, and they certainly deserved the name of “miracle town,” which i gave them in my article. the great difficulty always was to give our own people what they wanted and yet not to give the germans that which they wanted also. winston churchill’s remarkable memoirs--the best, in my opinion, of all the war books--have shown how heavily this pressed in high quarters. his volume is certainly a wonderful vindication of his term of office, and it was a loss to the country when he left it. churchill was very open to ideas and sympathetic to those who were trying for some ideal. i had pondered much over armour for the troops, and he commented on it in an inspiring letter, in which he said that the bullet-proof man and the torpedo-proof ship were our two great objects. i worked a good deal upon the question of shields, and wrote several articles about it in “the times” and other papers, but the forces against us were strong. when i saw mr. montague on the subject at the ministry of munitions, he said: “sir arthur, there is no use your arguing here, for there is no one in the building who does not know that you are right. the whole difficulty lies in making the soldiers accept your views.” one has, of course, to be reasonable on the point, and to admit that there is a limit to what a man can carry, and that greater weight means slower movement, and therefore longer exposure. that is fully granted. but when the helmet in actual practice was found so useful, why should it not be supplemented by steel shoulder-guards, since the helmet might actually guide the bullets down on to the shoulders? and why not a plastron over the heart? the vital points in a man’s anatomy are not really so numerous. if many a life was saved by a buckle or a cigarette-case, why should such protection not be systematized? and why in trench warfare should not strong breastplates be kept for the temporary use of any troops in the front line? i experimented with my own service rifle upon steel plates, and i was surprised to find how easy it was at twenty paces to turn a bullet. i am convinced that very many lives would have been saved had my views been adopted, and that the men in the hour of danger would have been only too glad to carry that part of their equipment. the tank, however, was a device which carried the armour and the men also, so that it was an extension of these ideas. we can never be grateful enough to the men who thought out the tank, for i have no doubt at all that this product of british brains and british labour won the war, which would otherwise have ended in a peace of mutual exhaustion. churchill, d’eyncourt, tritton, swinton and bertie stern,--these were in sober fact, divide the credit as you may, the men who played a very essential part in bringing down the giant. our household suffered terribly in the war. the first to fall was my wife’s brother, malcolm leckie, of the army medical service, whose gallantry was so conspicuous that he was awarded a posthumous d.s.o. while he was actually dying himself, with shrapnel in his chest, he had the wounded to his bedside and bandaged them. then came the turn of miss loder symonds, who lived with us and was a beloved member of the family. three of her brothers were killed and the fourth wounded. finally, on an evil day for us, she also passed on. then two brave nephews, alec forbes and oscar hornung, went down with bullets through the brain. my gallant brother-in-law, major oldham, was killed by a sniper during his first days in the trenches. and then finally, just as all seemed over, i had a double blow. first it was my kingsley, my only son by the first marriage, one of the grandest boys in body and soul that ever a father was blessed with. he had started the war as a private, worked up to an acting captaincy in the 1st hampshires, and been very badly wounded on the somme. it was pneumonia which slew him in london, and the same cursed plague carried off my soldier brother innes, he who had shared my humble strivings at southsea so many years ago. a career lay before him, for he was only forty and already adjutant-general of a corps, with the legion of honour, and a great record of service. but he was called and he went like the hero he was. “you do not complain at all, sir,” said the orderly. “i am a soldier,” said the dying general. thank god that i have since found that the gates are not shut, but only ajar, if one does show earnestness in the quest. of all these that i have mentioned, there is but one from whom i have been unable to obtain clear proof of posthumous existence. chapter xxviii experiences on the british front lord newton--how i got out--sir w. robertson--the destroyer--first experience of trenches--ceremony at bethune--mother--the ypres salient--ypres--the hull territorial--general sir douglas haig--artillery duel--kingsley--major wood--paris. i had naturally wished to get out to the british front and to see things for myself. and yet i had scruples also, for when soldiers are doing a difficult job mere spectators and joy-riders are out of place. i felt what a perfect nuisance they must be, and hesitated to join them. on the other hand, i had surely more claims than most, since i was not only compiling a history of the campaign, but was continually writing in the press upon military subjects. i made up my mind, therefore, that i was justified in going, but i had as yet no opportunity. however, it came along in a very strange way. it was in the early summer of 1916 that i had a note from lord newton, saying that he wished to see me at the foreign office. i could not conceive what he wanted to see me about, but of course i went. lord newton seemed to be doing general utility work which involved the interests of our prisoners in germany, as well as press arrangements, missions, etc. the former alone would be enough for anyone, and he was exposed to severe criticism for not being sufficiently zealous in the cause. “newton, the teuton,” sang the prisoners, a parody on “gilbert, the filbert,” one of the idiotic popular songs of pre-war days. however, i am convinced that he really did his very best, and that his policy was wise, for if it came to an interchange of revenge and barbarity between germany and us, there was only one in it. there is no use starting a game in which you are bound to be beaten. winston churchill had tried it in the case of the submarine officers, with the result that thirty of our own picked officers had endured much in their prisons and the policy had to be reconsidered. lord newton is a wit and has a humorous face which covers a good deal of solid capacity. he plunged instantly into the business on hand. “it is the italian army,” said he. “they want a bit of limelight. we propose to send several fellows on short missions to write them up. your name has been mentioned and approved. will you go?” i never thought more quickly in my life than on that occasion. i had no plan when i entered the room, since i was ignorant of the proposition, but i saw my opening in a flash. “no,” said i. lord newton looked surprised. “why not?” he asked. “because i should be in a false position,” i answered. “i have nothing to compare them with. i have not even seen the british front yet. how absurd it would be for me to approve or to condemn when they could reasonably ask me what i knew about the matter!” “would you go if that were set right?” “yes, certainly.” “then i don’t think there will be an insuperable difficulty.” “well, if you can arrange that, i am entirely at your disposal.” “by the way,” said he, “if you go to the front, and especially to the italian front, a uniform will be essential. what have you a right to wear?” “i am a private in the volunteers.” he laughed. “i think you would be shot at sight by both armies,” said he. “you would be looked upon as a rare specimen. i don’t think that would do.” i had a happy thought. “i am a deputy-lieutenant of surrey,” said i. “i have the right to wear a uniform when with troops.” “excellent!” he cried. “nothing could be better. well, you will hear from me presently.” i went straight off to my tailor, who rigged me up in a wondrous khaki garb which was something between that of a colonel and a brigadier, with silver roses instead of stars or crowns upon the shoulder-straps. as i had the right to wear several medals, including the south african, the general effect was all right, but i always felt a mighty impostor, though it was certainly very comfortable and convenient. i was still a rare specimen, and quite a number of officers of three nations made inquiry about my silver roses. a deputy-lieutenant may not be much in england, but when translated into french--my french anyhow--it has an awe-inspiring effect, and i was looked upon by them as an inscrutable but very big person with a uniform all of his own. it was in may when i had my meeting with lord newton, and towards the end of the month i received a pass which would take me to the british lines. i remember the solicitude of my family, who seemed to think that i was going on active service. to quiet their kindly anxieties i said: “my dears, i shall be held in the extreme rear, and i shall be lucky if ever i see a shell burst on the far horizon.” the sequel showed that my estimate was nearly as mistaken as theirs. i had had some correspondence with general robertson, and had dedicated my history of the war to him, so much was i impressed with the splendid work he had done behind the line in the early days, when cowans and he had as much strain and anxiety from their position in the wings as any of those who were in the limelight of the stage. he was, as it happened, going over to france, and he sent me a note to ask whether i would like to share his private compartment on the train and then use his destroyer instead of the ordinary steamer. of course i was delighted. general robertson is a sturdy, soldierly, compact man, with a bull-dog face and looks as if he might be obstinate and even sullen if crossed. such men are splendid if they keep their qualities for the enemy, but possibly dangerous if they use them on their associates. certainly robertson had a great deal of fighting to do at home as well as abroad, and was in the latter days of the war in constant conflict with the authorities, and with an open feud against the prime minister, but it is hard to say who was right. perhaps, if it were not for the pressure which robertson, repington and others exercised, it would have been more difficult to raise those last few hundred thousand men who saved us in 1918. like so many big men, his appearance was most deceptive, and though he looked every inch the soldier, there was nothing to show that great capacity for handling a large business, which would surely have put him at the head of any commercial concern in the country. there was a cromwellian touch in him which peeped out in occasional religious allusions. he was very engrossed in papers and figures, and i hardly had a word with him between london and newhaven. we went straight on to the destroyer and she cast off her moorings within a few minutes. the channel crossing was a great experience for me, and i stood on the bridge all the time looking about for traces of war--which were not numerous. just under the bridge stood a sturdy seaman in pea jacket and flapped cap, an intent, crouching, formidable figure, with his hand on the crank of a quick-firing gun. he never relaxed, and for the whole hour, as we tore across, his head, and occasionally his gun, was slowly traversing from right to left. the captain, a young lieutenant whose name i have forgotten, told me what hellish work it was in the winter, though perhaps “hellish” is not the _mot juste_ for that bitterly cold vigil. his ship was called the _zulu_. shortly afterwards it was blown up, as was its consort the _nubian_, but as two of the halves were still serviceable, they stuck them together and made one very good ship, the _zubian_. you can’t beat the british dockyard any more than you can the british navy which it mothers. that evening we ran through some twenty miles of northern france, and wound up at the usual guesthouse, where i met several travelling russians. colonel wilson, a dark, quiet, affable man, who had the thorny job of looking after the press, and brig.-general charteris, a pleasant, breezy, fresh-complexioned soldier, head of the british intelligence department, joined us at dinner. everything was quite comfortable, but at the same time properly plain and simple. there is nothing more hateful than luxury behind a battle-line. next day i had a wonderful twelve hours in contact with the soldiers all the time, and i will take some account of it from the notes i made at the time, but now i can expand them and give names more freely. the crowning impression which i carried away from that wonderful day was the enormous imperturbable confidence of the army and its extraordinary efficiency in organization, administration, material, and personnel. i met in one day a sample of many types, an army commander, a corps commander, two divisional commanders, staff officers of many grades, and, above all, i met repeatedly the two very great men whom britain has produced, the private soldier and the regimental officer. everywhere and on every face one read the same spirit of cheerful bravery. even the half-mad cranks whose absurd consciences prevented them from barring the way to the devil seemed to me to be turning into men under the prevailing influence. i saw a batch of them, neurotic and largely bespectacled, but working with a will by the roadside. there was no foolish bravado, no underrating of a dour opponent, but a quick, alert, confident attention to the job in hand which was an inspiration to the observer. “get out of the car. don’t let it stay here. it may be hit.” these words from a staff officer gave you the first idea that things were going to happen. up to then you might have been driving through the black country in the walsall district with the population of aldershot let loose upon its dingy roads. “put on this shrapnel helmet. that hat of yours would infuriate the boche”--this was an unkind allusion to my uniform. “take this gas mask. you won’t need it, but it is a standing order. now come on!” we crossed a meadow and entered a trench. here and there it came to the surface again where there was dead ground. at one such point an old church stood, with an unexploded shell sticking out of the wall. a century hence folk may journey to see that shell. then on again through an endless cutting. it was slippery clay below. i had no nails in my boots, an iron pot on my head, and the sun above me. i remember that walk. the telephone wires ran down the side. here and there large thistles and other plants grew from the clay walls, so immobile had been our lines. occasionally there were patches of untidiness. “shells,” said the officer laconically. there was a racket of guns before us and behind, especially behind, but danger seemed remote with all these bairnsfather groups of cheerful tommies at work around us. i passed one group of grimy, tattered boys. a glance at their shoulders showed me that they were of a public-school battalion, the 20th royal fusiliers. “i thought you fellows were all officers now,” i remarked. “no, sir, we like it better so.” “well, it will be a great memory for you. we are all in your debt.” they saluted, and we squeezed past them. they had the fresh brown faces of boy cricketers. but their comrades were men of a different type, with hard, strong, rugged features, and the eyes of men who have seen strange sights. these were veterans, men of mons, and their young pals of the public schools had something to live up to. up to this we only had two clay walls to look at. but now our interminable and tropical walk was lightened by the sight of a british aeroplane sailing overhead. numerous shrapnel bursts were all around it, but she floated on serenely, a thing of delicate beauty against the blue background. now another passed--and yet another. all the morning we saw them circling and swooping, and never a sign of a boche. they told me it was nearly always so--that we held the air, and that the boche intruder, save at early morning, was a rare bird. “we have never met a british aeroplane which was not ready to fight,” said a captured german aviator. there was a fine, stern courtesy between the airmen on either side, each dropping notes into the other’s aerodromes to tell the fate of missing officers. had the whole war been fought by the germans as their airmen conducted it (i do not speak, of course, of the zeppelin murderers), a peace would eventually have been more easily arranged. and now we were there--in what was surely the most wonderful spot in the world--the front firing trench, the outer breakwater which held back the german tide. how strange that this monstrous oscillation of giant forces, setting in from east to west, should find their equilibrium across this particular meadow of flanders. “how far?” i asked. “one hundred and eighty yards,” said my guide. “pop!” remarked a third person just in front. “a sniper,” said my guide; “take a look through the periscope.” i did so. there was some rusty wire before me, then a field sloping slightly upwards with knee-deep grass, and ragged dock and fennel and nettles, then rusty wire again, and a red line of broken earth. there was not a sign of movement, but sharp eyes were always watching us, even as these crouching soldiers around me were watching them. there were dead germans in the grass before us. you need not see them to know that they were there. a wounded soldier sat in a corner nursing his leg. here and there men popped out like rabbits from dug-outs and mine-shafts. others sat on the fire-step or leaned smoking against the clay wall. who would dream, who looked at their bold, careless faces, that this was a front line, and that at any moment it was possible that a grey wave might submerge them? with all their careless bearing, i noticed that every man had his gas mask and his rifle within easy reach. a mile of front trenches and then we were on our way back down that weary walk. then i was whisked off upon a ten-mile drive. there was a pause for lunch at corps head-quarters, and after it we were taken to a medal presentation in the market square of bethune. generals munro, haking, and landon, famous fighting soldiers all three, were the british representatives. munro, with a ruddy face, all brain above, all bulldog below; haking, pale, distinguished, intellectual; landon, a pleasant genial country squire. an elderly french general stood beside them. british infantry kept the ground. in front were about fifty frenchmen in civil dress of every grade of life, workmen and gentlemen, in a double rank. they were all so wounded that they were back in civil life, but to-day they were to have some solace for their wounds. they leaned heavily on sticks, their bodies twisted and maimed, but their faces were shining with pride and joy. the french general drew his sword and addressed them. one caught words like “honneur” and “patrie.” they leaned forward on their crutches, hanging on every syllable which came hissing and rasping from under that heavy white moustache. then the medals were pinned on. one poor lad was terribly wounded and needed two sticks. a little girl ran out with some flowers. he leaned forward and tried to kiss her, but the crutches slipped and he nearly fell upon her. it was a pitiful but beautiful little scene. next the british candidates marched up one by one for their medals, hale, hearty men, brown and fit. there was a smart young officer of scottish rifles; and then a selection of worcesters, welsh fusiliers and scots fusiliers, with one funny little highlander, a tiny figure with a soup-bowl helmet, a grinning boy’s face beneath it, and a bedraggled uniform. “many acts of great bravery”--such was the record for which he was decorated. even the french wounded smiled at his quaint appearance, as they did at another briton who had acquired the chewing-gum habit, and came up for his medal as if he had been called suddenly in the middle of his dinner, which he was still endeavouring to bolt. then came the end, with the national anthem. the british battalion formed fours and went past. to me that was the most impressive sight of any. they were the queen’s west surreys, a veteran battalion of the great ypres battle. what grand fellows! as the order came, “eyes right,” and all those fierce, dark faces flashed round at us i felt the might of the british infantry, the intense individuality which is not incompatible with the highest discipline. much they had endured, but a great spirit shone from their faces. i confess that as i looked at those brave english lads, and thought of what we owed to them and to their like who have passed on, i felt more emotional than befits a briton in foreign parts. how many of them are left alive to-day! now the ceremony was ended, and once again we set out for the front. it was to an artillery observation post just opposite the loos salient that we were bound. in an hour i found myself, together with a razor-keen young artillery observer and an excellent old sportsman of a russian prince, jammed into a very small space, and staring through a slit at the german lines. in front of us lay a vast plain, scarred and slashed, with bare places at intervals, such as you see where gravel pits break a green common. not a sign of life or movement, save some wheeling crows. and yet down there, within a mile or so, was the population of a city. far away a single train was puffing at the back of the german lines. we were here on a definite errand. away to the right, nearly three miles off, was a small red house, dim to the eye but clear in the glasses, suspected as a german post. it was to go up this afternoon. the gun was some distance away, but i heard the telephone directions. “‘mother’ will soon do her in,” remarked the gunner boy cheerfully. “mother” was the name of the gun. “give her five six three four,” he cried through the ’phone. “mother” uttered a horrible bellow from somewhere on our right. an enormous spout of smoke rose ten seconds later from near the house. “a little short,” said our gunner. “two and a half minutes left,” added a little small voice, which represented another observer at a different angle. “raise her seven five,” said our boy encouragingly. “mother” roared more angrily than ever. “how will that do?” she seemed to say. “one and a half right,” said our invisible gossip. i wondered how the folk in the house were feeling as the shells crept ever nearer. “gun laid, sir,” said the telephone. “fire!” i was looking through my glass. a flash of fire on the house, a huge pillar of dust and smoke--then it settled, and an unbroken field was there. the german post had gone up. “it’s a dear little gun,” said the officer boy. “and her shells are reliable,” remarked a senior behind us. “they vary with different calibres, but ‘mother’ never goes wrong.” the german line was very quiet. “pourquoi ne repondent ils pas?” asked the russian prince. “yes, they are quiet to-day,” answered the senior. “but we get it in the neck sometimes.” we were all led off to be introduced to “mother,” who sat, squat and black, amid twenty of her grimy children who waited upon her and fed her. a dainty eater was “mother,” and nothing served her but the best and plenty of it. but she was important and as the war progressed it became more and more evident that in spite of that upstart family of quick-firers it was really the only big, heavy, well-established gun which could flatten out a road to the rhine. i had the great joy that night of seeing my brother innes, who had been promoted to colonel, and was acting as assistant adjutant-general of the 24th division, the head-quarters of which were at bailleul, where i dined at mess and occupied a small lodging in the town, which was about six miles from the front. one more experience wound up that wonderful day. that night we took a car after dark and drove north, and ever north, until at a late hour we halted and climbed a hill in the darkness. below was a wonderful sight. down on the flats, in a huge semicircle, lights were rising and falling. they were very brilliant, going up for a few seconds and then dying down. sometimes a dozen were in the air at one time. there were the dull thuds of explosions and an occasional rat-tat-tat. i have seen nothing like it, but the nearest comparison would be an enormous ten-mile railway station in full swing at night, with signals winking, lamps waving, engines hissing and carriages bumping. it was a terrible place, a place which will live as long as military history is written, for it was the ypres salient. what a salient too! a huge curve, as outlined by the lights, needing only a little more to be an encirclement. something caught the rope as it closed, and that something was the british soldier. but it was a perilous place by day and by night. never shall i forget the impression of ceaseless, malignant activity which was borne in upon me by the white, winking lights, the red sudden flares, and the horrible thudding noises in that place of death beneath me. * * * * * in old days we had a great name as organizers. then came a long period when we deliberately adopted a policy of individuality and “go as you please.” now once again in our sore need we had called on all our power of administration and direction. and it had not deserted us. we still had it in a supreme degree. even in peace time we have shown it in that vast, well-oiled, swift-running noiseless machine called the british navy. but our powers had risen with the need of them. the expansion of the navy was a miracle, the management of the transport a greater one, the formation of the new army the greatest of all time. to get the men was the least of the difficulties. to put them in the field, with everything down to the lid of the last field saucepan in its place, that was the marvel. the tools of the gunners and of the sappers, to say nothing of the knowledge of how to use them, were in themselves a huge problem. but it had all been met and mastered. so don’t let us talk too much about the muddling of the war office. it has become just a little ridiculous. i was the guest at head-quarters of a divisional general, capper, brother of the heroic leader of the 7th division, who might truly be called one of the two fathers of the british flying force, for it was he, with templer, who laid the first foundations from which so great an organization has arisen. my morning was spent in visiting two fighting brigadiers, mitford and jelf, cheery weather-beaten soldiers, respectful, as all our soldiers are, of the prowess of the hun, but serenely confident that we could beat him. in company with one of them i ascended a hill, the reverse slope of which was swarming with cheerful infantry in every stage of _déshabille_, for they were cleaning up after the trenches. once over the slope we advanced with some care, and finally reached a certain spot from which we looked down upon the german line. it was an observation post, about 1,000 yards from the german trenches, with our own trenches between us. we could see the two lines, sometimes only a few yards, as it seemed, apart, extending for miles on either side. the sinister silence and solitude were strangely dramatic. such vast crowds of men, such intensity of feeling, and yet only that open rolling country-side, with never a movement in its whole expanse. in the afternoon my brother drove me to the square at ypres. it was the city of a dream, this modern pompeii, destroyed, deserted and desecrated, but with a sad, proud dignity which made you involuntarily lower your voice as you passed through the ruined streets. it was a more considerable place than i had imagined, with many traces of ancient grandeur. no words can describe the absolute splintered wreck that the huns had made of it. the effect of some of the shells had been grotesque. one boiler-plated water tower, a thing 40 or 50 feet high, was actually standing on its head like a great metal top. there was not a living soul in the place save a few pickets of soldiers, and a number of cats which had become fierce and dangerous. now and then a shell still fell, but the huns probably knew that the devastation was already complete. we stood in the lonely grass-grown square, once the busy centre of the town, and we marvelled at the beauty of the smashed cathedral and the tottering cloth hall beside it. surely at their best they could not have looked more wonderful. if they were preserved even so, and if a heaven-inspired artist were to model a statue of belgium in front, belgium with one hand pointing to the treaty by which prussia guaranteed her safety and the other to the sacrilege behind her, it would make the most impressive group in the world. it was an evil day for belgium when her frontier was violated, but it was a worse one for germany. i venture to prophesy that it will be regarded by history as the greatest military as well as political error that has ever been made. had the great guns that destroyed liège made their first breach at verdun, what chance was there for paris? those few weeks of warning and preparation saved france, and left germany, like a weary and furious bull, tethered fast in the place of trespass and waiting for the inevitable pole-axe. we were glad to get out of the place, for the gloom of it lay as heavy upon our hearts as the shrapnel helmets did upon our heads. both were lightened as we sped back past empty and shattered villas to where, just behind the danger line, the normal life of rural flanders was carrying on as usual. a merry sight helped to cheer us, for scudding down wind above our heads came a boche aeroplane, with two british at her tail barking away with their machine guns, like two swift terriers after a cat. they shot rat-tat-tatting across the sky until we lost sight of them in the heat haze over the german line. the afternoon saw us on the sharpenburg, from which many a million will gaze in days to come, for from no other point can so much be seen. it was a spot forbid, but a special permit took us up, and the sentry on duty, having satisfied himself of our bona-fides, proceeded to tell us tales of the war in a pure hull dialect which might have been chinese for all that i could understand. that he was a “terrier” and had nine children were the only facts i could lay hold of. but i wished to be silent and to think--even, perhaps, to pray. here, just below my feet, were the spots which our dear lads, three of them my own kith, had sanctified with their blood. here, fighting for the freedom of the world, they cheerily gave their all. on that sloping meadow to the left of the row of houses on the opposite ridge the london scottish fought to the death on that grim november morning when the bavarians reeled back from their shot-torn line. that plain away on the other side of ypres was the place where the three grand canadian brigades, first of all men, stood up to the damnable gases of the hun. down yonder was hill 60, that blood-soaked kopje. the ridge over the fields was held by the cavalry against two army corps, and there where the sun struck the red roof among the trees i could just see gheluvelt, a name for ever to be associated with haig and the most vital battle of the war. as i turned away i was faced by my hull territorial, who still said incomprehensible things. i looked at him with other eyes. he had fought on yonder plain. he had slain huns, and he had nine children. could any one better epitomize the duties of a good citizen in days like these? i could have found it in my heart to salute him had i not known that it would have shocked him and made him unhappy. next day, it was june 1, i left my brother’s kindly care. i had fears for him, for he was much overworked and worried as adjutant-generals of busy divisions are likely to be. however, he was never one to admit it or to pity himself, and he begged me to carry the cheeriest report back to his wife. it was a great pleasure to me that so many officers took me aside to say how efficient he was, and how popular. he would not have wished me to say it were he alive, but i can leave it on record now. yesterday had been full, but the next day was not less so, for i had been asked (or ordered) to lunch at the general head-quarters at montreuil, the funny old town on a hill which i had learned to know well in days of peace. as we drove down a winding drive i saw two officers walking towards us. the younger of them stooped and beat the ground with his stick, from which we gathered that we were to go slow and raise no dust. we rightly conjectured that so curt an order could only come from the chief’s own aide. we saluted as we passed and carried away an impression of a heavy moustache and of abstracted blue eyes. i had a very much more definite impression when he came back presently, and we were all shown into the dining room. i should certainly put douglas haig, as i saw him that day, among the handsomest men i have ever known. he was not tall, but he was upright and well proportioned with every sign of strength and activity. but his face was remarkable for beauty and power. his eyes were very full and expressive, devoid of the fierceness of kitchener and yet with quite as much determination. but the long powerful jaw was the feature which spoke particularly of that never-to-be-beaten quality which saved the army when the line was broken in the first ypres battle and was destined to save it again in april, 1918, when he gave out his “back to the wall” order of the day. he was courteous but not talkative at lunch. after lunch he took me into a side room where he showed me the line of the divisions on the map, saying that i could remember but should not take notes, which was rather maddening. then we had a long talk over the coffee, but there were several present and nothing intimate was said. he must be worried to death with casual visitors, but still i suppose he need not invite all of them to head-quarters. he had, i thought, a truly british distrust of foreigners. “he is the worst foreigner i have met yet,” he said, speaking of some italian general. his kind heart was shown when i said that my son was in the line. he gave a curt order, and then nodded and smiled. “you’ll see him to-morrow,” said he. i naturally heard a good deal about our generalissimo, besides what i actually saw. i think that he had some of the traits of wellington, though since the war he has concerned himself with the fortunes of his comrades-in-arms a great deal more than the iron duke seems ever to have troubled himself to do. but in other things the parallel is close. haig is not a game-playing man, though fond of horse exercise. neither was the duke. both were abstemious with wine and tobacco. both were reserved, reticent and had no magnetic connection with those under them. neither haig nor the duke were human figures to the soldiers, nor were they often if ever seen by them, and yet in each case there was the same confidence in their judgment. haig was a very serious man, he seldom joked and did not meet a joke half way, so that his mess was the dullest in france. i have known a staff officer apply for an exchange so weary was he of this oppressive atmosphere. all this could equally have been said of the duke. but these are trivialities compared to the great main fact that each brought rare qualities to the service of their country at critical moments of the world’s history. there was only one other man who might have filled haig’s place, and that man was the conqueror of palestine. extraordinary are the contrasts of war. within three hours of leaving the quiet atmosphere of the head-quarters château i was present at what in any other war would have been looked upon as a brisk engagement. as it was it would certainly figure in one of our desiccated reports as an activity of the artillery. the noise as we struck the line at this new point showed that the matter was serious, and indeed we had chosen the spot because it had been the storm centre of the last week. the method of approach chosen by our experienced guide was in itself a tribute to the gravity of the affair. as one comes from the settled order of flanders into the actual scene of war, the first sign of it is one of the stationary, sausage-shaped balloons, a chain of which marks the ring in which the great wrestlers are locked. we passed under this, ascended a hill, and found ourselves in a garden where for a year no feet save those of wanderers like ourselves had stood. there was a wild, confused luxuriance of growth more beautiful to my eye than anything which the care of man can produce. one old shell-hole of vast diameter had filled itself with forget-me-nots, and appeared as a graceful basin of light blue flowers, held up as an atonement to heaven for the brutalities of man. through the tangled bushes we crept, then across a yard--“please stoop and run as you pass this point”--and finally to a small opening in a wall, whence the battle lay not so much before as beside us. for a moment we had a front seat at the great world-drama, god’s own problem play, working surely to its magnificent end. one felt a sort of shame to crouch here in comfort, a useless spectator, while brave men down yonder were facing that pelting shower of iron. there was a large field on our left rear, and the german gunners had the idea that there was a concealed battery therein. they were systematically searching for it. a great shell exploded in the top corner, but got nothing more solid than a few tons of clay. you could read the mind of gunner fritz. “try the lower corner!” said he, and up went the earth-cloud once again. “perhaps it’s hid about the middle. i’ll try.” earth again, and nothing more. “i believe i was right the first time after all,” said hopeful fritz. so another shell came into the top corner. the field was full of pits as a gruyère cheese, but fritz got nothing by his perseverance. perhaps there never was a battery there at all. one effect he obviously did attain. he made several other british batteries exceedingly angry. “stop that tickling, fritz!” was the burden of their cry. where they were we could no more see than fritz could, but their constant work was very clear along the german line. we appeared to be using more shrapnel and the germans more high explosives, but that may have been just the chance of the day. the vimy ridge was on our right, and before us was the old french position, with the labyrinth of terrible memories and the long hill of lorette. when, the year before last, the french, in a three weeks’ battle, fought their way up that hill, it was an exhibition of sustained courage which even their military annals can seldom have beaten. [illustration: kingsley conan doyle.] next day we travelled through acheux and hit the british line once more to the east of that place. our official chauffeur had had his instructions, and so had other people, with the result that as we swung into the broad main street of a village--mailly, i think, was the name--there was a tall young officer standing with his back turned. he swung round at the noise of the car, and it was my boy kingsley with his usual jolly grin upon his weather-stained features. the long arm of g.h.q. had stretched out and plucked him out of a trench, and there he was. we had an hour’s talk in a field, for there was nowhere else to go. he was hard and well and told me that all was nearly ready for a big push at the very part of the line where his battalion, the 1st hampshires, was stationed. this was the first intimation of the great somme battle, on the first day of which every officer of the hampshires without exception was killed or wounded. i learned afterwards that before the battle for ten nights running kingsley crept out to the german wire and stuck up crosses, where he found the wire uncut, which were brown towards the enemy and white towards the british, as a guide to the gunners. he lay on his face sometimes with the machine guns firing just above him. for this service colonel palk thanked him warmly and said he should certainly have a decoration, but palk and both majors were killed and no recommendations went forward. two shrapnel bullets in the neck were all kingsley got out of the battle, and two months on his back in a hospital. however, he was not a medal hunter and i never heard him complain, nor would he wear his wound badges until he was compelled. an hour later i met another member of my household, for my secretary, major wood of the 5th sussex territorials, was town major of beauquesne, where i found him at the convenient hour of lunch. he had done nearly two years of hard active service, which was pretty good for a civilian of fifty, and had led his company at festubert and other engagements. he was now using his excellent powers of organization and administration in making beauquesne a well-ordered village, as later he made doullens a well-ordered town. i expect that the british administration will remain as a wonderful legend of sanitation and cleanliness in many of these french towns of the north-east. after inspecting major wood’s work i went on to amiens with him and he packed me into the train to paris, the first part of my task thoroughly done so far as time would permit. i came away with a deep sense of the difficult task which lay before the army, but with an equally deep one of the ability of those men to do all that soldiers can be called upon to perform. but i saw no end to the war. i had two days in paris--a very dead and alive paris, such a paris as has seldom or never been seen before, with darkened streets and the shops nearly all closed. i stayed at the hotel crillon, where were a few russian and british officers. it was extraordinary the difference which the public made between the two. a british officer was disregarded, while a russian general--i took a walk with one--was looked upon with an adulation which was quite comic. men came up and made a low obeisance before him. and yet it was our army, our purse, our factories, above all our navy, which were saving the situation both for france and russia, to whom we were bound by no alliance. there was certainly not much sign of appreciation or gratitude. it is a very singular thing how the whole world alternately leans upon and depreciates the british empire. chapter xxix experiences on the italian front the polite front--udine--under fire--carnic alps--italia irredenta--trentino--the voice of the holy roman empire. two days later i found myself, after an uneventful journey, at padua on my way to the italian front. the italian front seemed to have politely come back to meet me, for i was awakened in the night by a tremendous dropping of bombs, with the rattle of anti-aircraft guns. i thought i was as safe in bed as anywhere, and so it proved. little damage was done, but padua and the other italian cities were having a bad time, and it was a one-sided arrangement, since the italians can do nothing without injuring their own kith and kin across the border. this dropping of explosives on the chance of hitting one soldier among fifty victims was surely the most monstrous development of the whole war, and was altogether german in its origin. if international law cannot now stamp it out, the next war will send the people flying to the caves and calling upon the mountains to cover them, even as was foretold. i arrived at last at udine, the capital of the friulian province, where were the italian head-quarters--a funny little town with a huge mound in the centre, which looked too big to be artificial, but was said to have been thrown up by attila. my recommendation was to the british mission, which was headed by brig.-general delme-radcliffe, a bluff, short-spoken and masterful british soldier, who received me with hospitality. the mission owned a white house on the edge of the town. on the second floor under a window which proved to be that of my bedroom there was a long dark smear on the whitewashed wall. “that’s the stomach of a baker,” said the soldier-servant with a grin. i thought it was a joke on his part, but it was literally true, for a bomb a few days before had blown the man to bits as he passed the house, and had plastered bits of him on the stonework. the ceiling of my bedroom was full of holes from that or some other explosion. there was some tendency at this time to cavil at the italians and to wonder why they did not make more impression upon the austrians. as a matter of fact they were faced by the same barbed wire and machine-gun problem which had held up every one else. i soon saw, when i was allowed next morning to get to the front, that the conditions were very like those of flanders in a more genial climate and in all ways less aggravated. i had been handed over to the italian intelligence people, who were represented by a charmingly affable nobleman, colonel the marquis barbariche, and colonel claricetti. these two introduced me at once to general porro, chief of the staff, a brown, wrinkled, walnut-faced warrior, who showed me some plans and did what he could to be helpful. it was about a seven miles drive from udine before we reached the nearest point of the trenches. from a mound an extraordinary view could be got of the austrian position, the general curve of both lines being marked, as in flanders, by the sausage balloons which float behind them. the isonzo, which had been so bravely carried by the italians, lay in front of me, a clear blue river, as broad as the thames at hampton court. in a hollow to my left were the roofs of gorizia, the town which the italians were endeavouring to take. a long desolate ridge, the carso, extended to the south of the town, and stretched down nearly to the sea. the crest was held by the austrians, and the italian trenches had been pushed within fifty yards of them. a lively bombardment was going on from either side, but so far as the infantry went there was none of that constant malignant petty warfare with which we were familiar in flanders. i was anxious to see the italian trenches, in order to compare them with our british methods, but save for the support and communication trenches i was courteously but firmly warned off. having got this general view of the position, i was anxious in the afternoon to visit monfalcone, which is the small dockyard captured from the austrians on the adriatic. my kind italian officer guides did not recommend the trip, as it was part of their great hospitality to shield their guest from any part of that danger which they were always ready to incur themselves. the only road to monfalcone ran close to the austrian position at the village of ronchi, and afterwards kept parallel to it for some miles. i was told that it was only on odd days that the austrian guns were active in this particular section, so determined to trust to luck that this might not be one of them. it proved, however, to be one of the worst on record, and we were not destined to see the dockyard to which we started. the civilian cuts a ridiculous figure when he enlarges upon small adventures which may come his way--adventures which the soldier endures in silence as part of his everyday life. on this occasion, however, the episode was all our own, and had a sporting flavour in it which made it dramatic. i know now the feeling of tense expectation with which the driven grouse whirrs onwards towards the butt. i have been behind the butt before now, and it is only poetic justice that i should see the matter from the other point of view. as we approached ronchi we could see shrapnel breaking over the road in front of us, but we had not yet realized that it was precisely for vehicles that the austrians were waiting, and that they had the range marked down to a yard. we went down the road all out at a steady fifty miles an hour. the village was near, and it seemed that we had got past the place of danger. we had, in fact, just reached it. at this moment there was a noise as if the whole four tyres had gone simultaneously, a most terrific bang in our very ears, merging into a second sound like a reverberating blow upon an enormous gong. as i glanced up i saw three clouds immediately above my head, two of them white and the other of a rusty red. the air was full of flying metal, and the road, as we were told afterwards by an observer, was all churned up by it. the metal base of one of the shells was found plumb in the middle of the road just where our motor had been. it was our pace that saved us. the motor was an open one, and the three shells burst, according to one of my italian companions, who was himself an artillery officer, about ten metres above our heads. they threw forward, however, and we, travelling at so great a pace, shot from under. before they could get in another we had swung round the curve and under the lee of a house. the good colonel wrung my hand in silence. they were both distressed, these good soldiers, under the impression that they had led me into danger. as a matter of fact it was i who owed them an apology, since they had enough risks in the way of business without taking others in order to gratify the whim of a visitor. our difficulties were by no means over. we found an ambulance lorry and a little group of infantry huddled under the same shelter, with the expression of people who had been caught in the rain. the road beyond was under heavy fire as well as that by which we had come. had the ostro-boches dropped a high explosive upon us they would have had a good mixed bag. but apparently they were only out for fancy shooting and disdained a sitter. presently there came a lull and the lorry moved on, but we soon heard a burst of firing which showed that they were after it. my companions had decided that it was out of the question for us to finish our excursion. we waited for some time, therefore, and were able finally to make our retreat on foot, being joined later by the car. so ended my visit to monfalcone, the place i did not reach. i hear that two 10,000-ton steamers were left on the stocks there by the austrians, but were disabled before they retired. their cabin basins and other fittings were adorning the italian dug-outs. my second day was devoted to a view of the italian mountain warfare in the carnic alps. besides the two great fronts, one of defence (trentino) and one of offence (isonzo), there were very many smaller valleys which had to be guarded. the total frontier line is over 400 miles, and it had all to be held against raids if not invasions. it was a most picturesque business. far up in the roccolana valley i found the alpini outposts, backed by artillery which had been brought into the most wonderful positions. they had taken 8-inch guns where a tourist could hardly take his knapsack. neither side could ever make serious progress, but there were continual duels, gun against gun, or alpini against jaeger. in a little wayside house was the brigade head-quarters, and here i was entertained to lunch. it was a scene that i shall remember. they drank to england. i raised my glass to _italia irredenta_--might it soon be redenta. they all sprang to their feet and the circle of dark faces flashed into flame. they keep their souls and emotions, these people. i trust that ours may not become atrophied by self-suppression. the last day spent on the italian front was in the trentino. from verona a motor drive of about twenty-five miles takes one up the valley of the adige, and past a place of evil augury for the austrians, the field of rivoli. finally, after a long drive of winding gradients, always beside the adige, we reached ala, where we interviewed the commander of the sector, a man who has done splendid work during the recent fighting. “by all means you can see my front. but no motor car, please. it draws fire, and others may be hit besides you.” we proceeded on foot, therefore, along a valley which branched at the end into two passes. in both very active fighting had been going on, and as we came up the guns were baying merrily, waking up most extraordinary echoes in the hills. it was difficult to believe that it was not thunder. there was one terrible voice that broke out from time to time in the mountains--the angry voice of the holy roman empire. when it came all other sounds died down into nothing. it was--so i was told--the master gun, the vast 42-centimetre giant which brought down the pride of liège and namur. the austrians had brought one or more from innsbruck. the italians assure me, however, as we have ourselves discovered, that in trench work beyond a certain point the size of the guns makes little matter. we passed a burst dug-out by the roadside where a tragedy had occurred recently, for eight medical officers were killed in it by a single shell. there was no particular danger in the valley, however, and the aimed fire was all going across us to the fighting lines in the two passes above us. that to the right, the valley of buello, has seen some of the worst of the fighting. these two passes form the italian left wing which has held firm all through. so has the right wing. it is only the centre which has been pushed in by the concentrated fire. when we arrived at the spot where the two valleys forked we were halted, and were not permitted to advance to the front trenches which lay upon the crests above us. there were about 1,000 yards between the adversaries. i have seen types of some of the bosnian and croatian prisoners, men of poor physique and intelligence, but the italians speak with chivalrous praise of the bravery of the hungarians and of the austrian jaeger. some of their proceedings disgusted them, however, and especially the fact that they used russian prisoners to dig trenches under fire. there is no doubt of this, as some of the men were recaptured and were sent on to join their comrades in france. on the whole, however, it may be said that in the austro-italian war there was nothing which corresponded with the extreme bitterness of our western conflict. the presence or absence of the hun makes all the difference. it was a moment of depression at the trentino front, as there had been a set back. i may flatter myself when i think that even one solitary figure in a british uniform striding about them was good at that particular time to their eyes. they read of allies, but they never saw any. if they had, we might have been spared the subsequent disaster at caporetto. certainly i was heartily welcomed there, and surrounded all the time by great mobs of soldiers, who imagined, i suppose, that i was some one of importance. that night found me back at verona, and next morning i was on my way to paris with sheaves of notes about the italian soldiers which would, i hoped, make the british public more sympathetic towards them. i was told afterwards by the foreign office that my mission had been an unmixed success. i have one other association with the italian front which i may include here. it is embalmed in the annals of the psychic research society. i have several times in my life awakened from sleep with some strong impressions of knowledge gained still lingering in my brain. in one case, for example, i got the strange name nalderu so vividly that i wrote it down between two stretches of insensibility and found it on the outside of my cheque book next morning. a month later i started for australia in the s.s. _naldera_ of which i had then never heard. in this particular italian instance i got the word piave, absolutely ringing in my head. i knew it as a river some seventy miles to the rear of the italian front and quite unconnected with the war. none the less the impression was so strong that i wrote the incident down and had it signed by two witnesses. months passed and the italian battle line was rolled back to the piave, which became a familiar word. some said it would go back further. i was sure it would not. i argued that if the abnormal forces, whatever they may be, had taken such pains to impress the matter upon me, it must needs be good news which they were conveying, since i had needed cheering at the time. therefore i felt sure that some great victory and the turning point of the war would come on the piave. so sure was i that i wrote to my friend mr. lacon watson, who was on the italian front, and the incident got into the italian press. it could have nothing but a good effect upon their morale. finally it is a matter of history how completely my impression was justified, and how the most shattering victory of the whole war was gained at that very spot. there is the fact, amply proved by documents and beyond all possible coincidence. as to the explanation some may say that our own subconscious self has power of foresight. if so it is a singularly dead instinct, seldom or never used. others may say that our “dead” can see further than we, and try when we are asleep and in spiritual touch with us, to give us knowledge and consolation. the latter is my own solution of the mystery. chapter xxx experiences on the french front a dreadful reception--robert donald--clemenceau--soissons cathedral--the commandant’s cane--the extreme outpost--adonis--general henneque--cyrano in the argonne--tir rapide--french canadian--wound stripes. when i got back to paris i had a dreadful reception, for as i dismounted from the railway car a british military policeman in his flat red cap stepped up to me and saluted. “this is bad news, sir,” said he. “what is it?” i gasped. “lord kitchener, sir. drowned!” “good god!” i cried. “yes, sir.” suddenly the machine turned for a moment into a human being. “too much talking in this war,” he said, and then in a moment was his stiff formal self again, and bustled off in search of deserters. kitchener dead! the words were like clods falling on my heart. one could not imagine him dead, that centre of energy and vitality. with a heavy spirit i drove back to my old quarters at the hotel crillon, fuller than ever of red-epauletted, sword-clanking russians. i could have cursed them, for it was in visiting their rotten, crumbling country that our hero had met his end. at the hotel i met by appointment mr. robert donald, editor of the “daily chronicle,” which paper had been publishing my articles. donald, a fine, solid scot, had the advantage of talking good french and being in thorough touch with french conditions. with him i called upon m. clemenceau, who had not at that time played any conspicuous part in the war, save as a violent critic. he lived modestly in a small house which showed that he had not used his power in the state and in journalism to any unfair personal advantage. he entered, a swarthy, wrinkled, white-haired man, with the face of a crabbed bulldog, and a cloth cap upon his head. he reminded me of old “jem” mace the bruiser, as i remember him in his final phase. his eyes looked angry, and he had a truculent, mischievous smile. i was not impressed by the judgment he showed in our conversation, if a squirt on one side and niagara on the other can be called conversation. he was railing loudly at the english rate of exchange between the franc and the pound, which seemed to me very like kicking against the barometer. mr. donald, who is a real authority upon finance, asked him whether france was taking the rouble at its face value; but the roaring voice, like a strong gramophone with a blunt needle, submerged all argument. against joffre he roared his reproaches, and intimated that he had some one else up his sleeve who could very soon bring the war to an end. a volcano of a man, dangerous sometimes to his friends, and sometimes to his foes. let me acknowledge that i did not at the time recognize that he would ever be the opposite number to lloyd george, and that the pair would lead us to victory. donald had arranged that he and i should visit the french lines in the argonne, which was as near as we could get to verdun, where the battle was at its height. there were a few days to spare, however, and in the meantime i got a chance of going to the soissons front, along with leo maxse, editor of the “national review,” and a m. chevillon, who had written an excellent book on british co-operation in the war. maxse, a dark little man, all nerves and ginger, might well plume himself that he was one of those who had foreseen the war and most loudly demanded preparation. chevillon was a grey-bearded father-of-a-family type, and could speak english, which promoted our closer acquaintance, as my french is adventurous but not always successful. a captain of french intelligence, a small, silent man, took the fourth place in the car. when our posterity hear that it was easy to run out from paris to the line, to spend a full day on the line, and to be back again in paris for dinner, it will make them appreciate how close a thing was the war. we passed in the first instance the woods of villars cotteret, where the guards had turned upon the german van on september 1, 1914. eighty guardsmen were buried in the village cemetery, among them a nephew of maxse’s, to whose tomb we now made pious pilgrimage. among the trees on either side of the road i noticed other graves of soldiers, buried where they had fallen. soissons proved to be a considerable wreck, though it was far from being an ypres. but the cathedral would, and will, make many a patriotic frenchman weep. these savages cannot keep their hands off a beautiful church. here, absolutely unchanged through the ages, was the spot where st. louis had dedicated himself to the crusade. every stone of it was holy. and now the lovely old stained-glass strewed the floor, and the roof lay in a huge heap across the central aisle. a dog was climbing over it as we entered. no wonder the french fought well. such sights would drive the mildest man to desperation. the abbé, a good priest, with a large humorous face, took us over his shattered domain. when i pointed out the desecration of the dog he shrugged his shoulders and said: “what matter? it will have to be reconsecrated, anyhow.” he connived at my gathering up some splinters of the rich old stained-glass as souvenirs for my wife. he was full of reminiscences of the german occupation of the place. one of his personal anecdotes was indeed marvellous. it was that a lady in the local ambulance had vowed to kiss the first french soldier who re-entered the town. she did so, and it proved to be her husband. the abbé was a good, kind, truthful man--but he had a humorous face. a walk down a ruined street brought one to the opening of the trenches. there were marks upon the walls of the german occupation, “berlin-paris,” with an arrow of direction, adorning one corner. at another the 76th regiment had commemorated the fact that they were there in 1870 and again in 1914. if the soissons folk are wise, they will keep these inscriptions as reminders to the rising generation. i could imagine, however, that their inclination will be to whitewash, fumigate, and forget. a sudden turn among some broken walls took one into the communication trench. our guide was a commandant of the staff, a tall, thin man with hard, grey eyes and a severe face. it was the more severe towards us, as i gathered that he had been deluded into the belief that only about one out of six of our soldiers went to the trenches. for the moment he was not friends with the english. as we went along, however, we gradually got on better terms, we discovered a twinkle in the hard, grey eyes, and the day ended with an exchange of walking-sticks between him and me and a renewal of the entente. may my cane grow into a marshal’s baton! a charming young artillery subaltern was our guide in that maze of trenches, and we walked and walked and walked, with a brisk exchange of compliments between the “75’s” of the french and the “77’s” of the germans going on high over our heads. the trenches were boarded at the sides, and had a more permanent look than those of flanders. presently we met a fine, brown-faced, upstanding boy, as keen as a razor, who commanded this particular section. a little farther on a helmeted captain of infantry, who was an expert sniper, joined our little party. now we were at the very front trench. i had expected to see primeval men, bearded and shaggy. but the “poilus” have disappeared. the men around me were clean and dapper to a remarkable degree. i gathered, however, that they had their internal difficulties. on one board i read an old inscription: “he is a boche, but he is the inseparable companion of a french soldier.” above was a rude drawing of a louse. i was led to a cunning loop-hole, and had a glimpse through it of a little framed picture of french countryside. there were fields, a road, a sloping hill beyond with trees. quite close, about thirty or forty yards away, was a low, red-tiled house. “they are there,” said our guide. “that is their outpost. we can hear them cough.” only the guns were coughing that morning, so we heard nothing; but it was certainly wonderful to be so near to the enemy and yet in such peace. i suppose wondering visitors from berlin were brought up also to hear the french cough. modern warfare has certainly some extraordinary sides. then we were shown all the devices which a year of experience had suggested to the quick brains of our allies. every form of bomb, catapult, and trench mortar was ready to hand. every method of cross-fire had been thought out to an exact degree. there was something, however, about the disposition of a machine gun which disturbed the commandant. he called for the officer of the gun. his thin lips got thinner and his grey eyes more austere as we waited. presently there emerged an extraordinarily handsome youth, dark as a spaniard, from some rabbit hole. he faced the commandant bravely, and answered back with respect but firmness. “pourquoi?” asked the commandant, and yet again “pourquoi?” adonis had an answer for everything. both sides appealed to the big captain of snipers, who was clearly embarrassed. he stood on one leg and scratched his chin. finally the commandant turned away angrily in the midst of one of adonis’ voluble sentences. his face showed that the matter was not ended. war is taken very seriously in the french army, and any sort of professional mistake is very quickly punished. many officers of high rank had been broken by the french during the war. there was no more forgiveness for the beaten general than there was in the days of the republic when the delegate of the national convention, with a patent portable guillotine, used to drop in at head-quarters to support a more vigorous offensive. it had come on to rain heavily, and we were forced to take refuge in the dug-out of the sniper. eight of us sat in the deep gloom huddled closely together. the commandant was still harping upon that ill-placed machine gun. he could not get over it. my imperfect ear for french could not follow all his complaints, but some defence of the offender brought forth a “jamais! jamais! jamais!” which was rapped out as if it came from the gun itself. there were eight of us in an underground burrow, and some were smoking. better a deluge than such an atmosphere as that. but if there was a thing upon earth which the french officer shied at it was rain and mud. the reason is that he was extraordinarily natty in his person. his charming blue uniform, his facings, his brown gaiters, boots and belts were always just as smart as paint. he was the dandy of the european war. i noticed officers in the trenches with their trousers carefully pressed. [illustration: on the french front. _from left_: “cyrano”; a. conan doyle; mr. robert donald; general henneque.] the rain had now stopped, and we climbed from our burrow. again we were led down that endless line of communication trench, again we stumbled through the ruins, again we emerged into the street where our cars were awaiting us. above our heads the sharp artillery duel was going merrily forward. the french were firing three or four to one, which had been my experience at every point i had touched upon the allied front. thanks to the extraordinary zeal of the french workers, especially of the french women, and to the clever adoption of machinery by their engineers, their supplies were abundant. our next expedition carried us to chalons, where the huns of old met disaster. from chalons we drove some twenty miles to st. menehould, and learned that the trenches were about ten miles north. on this expedition there were donald and i with an extraordinary spaniard, half don quixote, half gipsy troubadour, flat hatted and clad in brown corduroy, with a single arm, having, as we heard, lost the other in some broil. as he spoke no tongue but his own we were never on terms with him. the front at the sector which we struck was under the control of general henneque of the 10th division. a fine soldier this, and heaven help germany if he and his division had invaded it, for he was, as one could see at a glance, a man of iron who had been goaded to fierceness by all that his beloved country had endured. he was a man of middle size, swarthy, hawk-like, very abrupt in his movements, with two steel-grey eyes, which were the most searching that mine have ever met. his hospitality and courtesy to us were beyond all bounds, but there is another side to him, and it is one which it were wiser not to provoke. in person he took us to his lines, passing through the usual shot-torn villages behind them. where the road dipped down into the great forest there was one particular spot which was visible to the german artillery observers. the general mentioned it at the time, but his remark seemed to have no personal interest. we understood it better on our return in the evening. we then found ourselves in the depths of the woods--primeval woods of oak and beech in the deep clay soil that the great oak loves. there had been rain, and the forest paths were ankle deep in mire. everywhere, to right and left, soldiers’ faces, hard and rough from a year of open air, gazed up at us from their burrows in the ground. presently an alert, blue-clad figure, stood in the path to greet us. it was the colonel of the sector. he was ridiculously like cyrano de bergerac as depicted by the late m. coquelin, save that his nose was of more moderate proportion. the ruddy colouring, the bristling, feline, full-ended moustache, the solidity of pose, the backward tilt of the head, the general suggestion of the bantam cock, were all there facing us as he stood amid the leaves in the sunlight. gauntlets and a long rapier--nothing else was wanting. something had amused cyrano. his moustache quivered with suppressed mirth and his blue eyes were demurely gleaming. then the joke came out. he had spotted a german working-party, his guns had concentrated on it, and afterwards he had seen the stretchers go forward. a grim joke, it may seem. but the french saw this war from a different angle to us. if we had had the boche sitting on our heads for two years, and were not quite sure whether we could ever get him off again, we should get cyrano’s point of view. we passed in a little procession among the french soldiers, and viewed their multifarious arrangements. for them we were a little break in a monotonous life, and they formed up in lines as we passed. my own british uniform and the civilian dresses of my two companions interested them. as the general passed these groups, who formed themselves up in perhaps a more familiar manner than would have been usual in the british service, he glanced kindly at them with those singular eyes of his, and once or twice addressed them as “mes enfants.” one might conceive that all was “go as you please” among the french. so it was as long as you went in the right way. when you strayed from it you knew it. as we passed a group of men standing on a low ridge which overlooked us there was a sudden stop. i gazed round. the general’s face was steel and cement. the eyes were cold and yet fiery, sunlight upon icicles. something had happened. cyrano had sprung to his side. his reddish moustache had shot forward beyond his nose, and it bristled out like that of an angry cat. both were looking up at the group above us. one wretched man detached himself from his comrades and sidled down the slope. no skipper and mate of a yankee blood boat could have looked more ferociously at a mutineer. and yet it was all over some minor breach of discipline which was summarily disposed of by two days of confinement. then in an instant the faces relaxed, there was a general buzz of relief, and we were back at “mes enfants” again. trenches are trenches, and the main specialty of those in the argonne were that they were nearer to the enemy. in fact, there were places where they interlocked, and where the advanced posts lay cheek by jowl with a good steel plate to cover both cheek and jowl. we were brought to a sap-head where the germans were at the other side of a narrow forest road. had i leaned forward with extended hand and a boche done the same we could have touched. i looked across, but saw only a tangle of wire and sticks. even whispering was not permitted in those forward posts. when we emerged from these hushed places of danger cyrano took us all to his dug-out, which was a tasty little cottage carved from the side of a hill and faced with logs. he did the honours of the humble cabin with the air of a seigneur in his château. there was little furniture, but from some broken mansion he had extracted an iron fire-back, which adorned his grate. it was a fine, mediæval bit of work, with venus, in her traditional costume, in the centre of it. it seemed the last touch in the picture of the gallant virile cyrano. i only met him this once, nor shall i ever see him again, yet he stands a thing complete within my memory. always in the cinema of memory he will walk the leafy paths of the argonne, his fierce eyes searching for the boche workers, his red moustache bristling over their annihilation. he seems a figure out of the past of france. that night we dined with yet another type of the french soldier, general antoine, who commanded the corps of which my friend had one division. each of these french generals had a striking individuality of his own which i wish i could fix upon paper. their only common point was that each seemed to be a rare good soldier. the corps general was athos with a touch of d’artagnan. he was well over 6 feet high, bluff, jovial, with huge, upcurling moustache, and a voice that would rally a regiment. it was a grand figure, which should have been done by van dyck, with lace collar, hand on sword, and arm akimbo. jovial and laughing was he, but a stern and hard soldier was lurking behind the smiles. his name has appeared in history, and so has humbert’s, who ruled all the army of which the other corps is a unit. humbert was a lord roberts figure, small, wiry, quick-stepping, all steel and elastic, with a short, upturned moustache, which one could imagine as crackling with electricity in moments of excitement like a cat’s fur. what he does or says is quick, abrupt, and to the point. he fires his remarks like pistol shots at this man or that. once to my horror he fixed me with his hard little eyes and demanded; “sherlock holmes, est ce qu’il est un soldat dans l’armée anglaise?” the whole table waited in an awful hush. “mais, mon general,” i stammered, “il est trop vieux pour service.” there was general laughter, and i felt that i had scrambled out of an awkward place. and talking of awkward places, i had forgotten about that spot upon the road whence the boche observer could see our motor-cars. he had actually laid a gun upon it, the rascal, and waited all the long day for our return. no sooner did we appear upon the slope than a shrapnel shell burst above us, but somewhat behind me, as well as to the left. had it been straight the second car would have got it, and there might have been a vacancy in one of the chief editorial chairs in london. the general shouted to the driver to speed up, and we were soon safe from the german gunners. one got perfectly immune to noises in these scenes, for the guns which surrounded you made louder crashes than any shell which burst about you. it is only when you actually saw the cloud over you that your thoughts came back to yourself, and that you realized that in this wonderful drama you might be a useless super, but none the less you were on the stage and not in the stalls. next morning we were down in the front trenches again at another portion of the line. far away on our right, from a spot named the observatory, we could see the extreme left of the verdun position and shells bursting on the fille morte. to the north of us was a broad expanse of sunny france, nestling villages, scattered châteaux, rustic churches, and all as inaccessible as if it were the moon. it was a terrible thing this german bar--a thing unthinkable to britons. to stand on the edge of yorkshire and look into lancashire feeling that it was in other hands, that our fellow-countrymen were suffering there and waiting, waiting for help, and that we could not, after two years, come a yard nearer to them--would it not break our hearts? could i wonder that there was no smile upon the grim faces of those frenchmen! but when the bar was broken, when the line swept forward, when french bayonets gleamed on those uplands and french flags broke from those village spires--ah, what a day that was! men died that day from the pure delirious joy of it. yet another type of french general took us round this morning! he, too, was a man apart, an unforgettable man. conceive a man with a large, broad, good-humoured face, and two placid, dark, seal’s eyes which gazed gently into yours. he was young, and had pink cheeks and a soft voice. such was one of the most redoubtable fighters of france, this general of division dupont. his former staff officers told me something of the man. he was a philosopher, a fatalist, impervious to fear, a dreamer of distant dreams amid the most furious bombardment. the weight of the french assault upon the terrible labyrinth fell at one time upon the brigade which he then commanded. he led them day after day gathering up germans with the detached air of the man of science who is hunting for specimens. in whatever shell-hole he might chance to lunch he had his cloth spread and decorated with wild flowers plucked from the edge. i wrote of him at the time: “if fate be kind to him, he will go far.” as a matter of fact, before the end of the war he was one of the most influential members of the general staff, so my prophetic power was amply vindicated. from the observatory we saw the destruction of a german trench. there had been signs of work upon it, so it was decided to close it down. it was a very visible brown streak a thousand yards away. the word was passed back to the “75’s” in the rear. there was a “tir rapide” over our heads. my word, the man who stands fast under a “tir rapide,” be he boche, french or british, is a man of mettle! the mere passage of the shells was awe-inspiring, at first like the screaming of a wintry wind, and then thickening into the howling of a pack of wolves. the trench was a line of terrific explosions. then the dust settled down and all was still. where were the ants who had made the nest? were they buried beneath it? or had they got from under? no one could say. there was one little gun which fascinated me, and i stood for some time watching it. its three gunners, enormous helmeted men, evidently loved it, and touched it with a swift but tender touch in every movement. when it was fired it ran up an inclined plane to take off the recoil, rushing up and then turning and rattling down again upon the gunners who were used to its ways. the first time it did it, i was standing behind it, and i don’t know which jumped quickest--the gun or i. french officers above a certain rank develop and show their own individuality. in the lower grades the conditions of service enforce a certain uniformity. the british officer is a british gentleman first, and an officer afterwards. the frenchman is an officer first, though none the less the gentleman stands behind it. one very strange type we met, however, in these argonne woods. he was a french-canadian who had been a french soldier, had founded a homestead in far alberta, and had now come back of his own will, though a naturalized briton, to the old flag. he spoke english of a kind, the quality and quantity being equally extraordinary. it poured from him and was, so far as it was intelligible, of the woolly western variety. his views on the germans were the most emphatic we had met. “these godam sons of”--well, let us say “canines!” he would shriek, shaking his fist at the woods to the north of him. a good man was our compatriot, for he had a very recent legion of honour pinned upon his breast. he had been put with a few men on hill 285, a sort of volcano stuffed with mines, and was told to telephone when he needed relief. he refused to telephone, and remained there for three weeks. “we sit like one rabbit in his hall,” he explained. he had only one grievance--there were many wild boars in the forest, but the infantry were too busy to get them. “the godam artillaree he get the wild pig!” out of his pocket he pulled a picture of a frame house with snow round it, and a lady with two children on the stoep. it was his homestead at trochu, seventy miles north of calgary. it was the evening of the third day that we turned our faces towards paris once more. it was my last view of the french. the roar of their guns went far with me upon my way. i wrote at the time: “soldiers of france, farewell! in your own phrase, i salute you! many have seen you who had more knowledge by which to judge your manifold virtues, many also who had more skill to draw you as you are, but never one, i am sure, who admired you more than i. great was the french soldier, under louis the sun-king, great too under napoleon, but never was he greater than to-day.” but in spite of all their bravery only two things saved france, her field guns and the intervention of england. surely she should have a reckoning with her pre-war military authorities. imagine unwarlike britain, protected by the sea, and yet having a high standard of musketry, heavy guns with every division, and khaki uniforms, while warlike france, under the very shadow of germany, had poor musketry, primeval uniforms and no heavy guns. as to her early views of strategy they were lamentable. every british critic, above all lord kitchener, knew that the attack would swing round through belgium. france concentrated all her preparation upon the eastern frontier. it was clear also that the weaker power should be on the defensive and so bring her enemy by heavier losses down to her own weight. france attacked and broke herself in an impossible venture. there should have been a heavy reckoning against some one. the fate of england as well as of france was imperilled by the false estimates of the french general staff. one small visible result of my journey was the establishment of wound stripes upon the uniforms of the british. i had been struck by this very human touch among the french, which gave a man some credit and therefore some consolation for his sufferings. i represented the matter when i came back. lest i seem to claim more than is true, i append general robertson’s letter. the second sentence refers to that campaign for the use of armour which i had prosecuted so long, and with some success as regards helmets, though there the credit was mostly due to dr. saleeby, among civilians. the letter runs thus: war office, _august 14, 1916_. many thanks for sending me a copy of your little book. i will certainly see what can be done in regard to armour. you will remember that i took your previous tip as regards badges for wounded men. yours very truly, w. r. robertson. chapter xxxi breaking the hindenburg line lloyd george--my second excursion--the farthest german point--sir joseph cook--night before the day of judgment--the final battle--on a tank--horrible sight--speech to australians--the magic carpet. i find in my diary that the prime minister, mr. lloyd george, invited me to breakfast in april, 1917. some third person was, i understand, to have been present, but he did not arrive, so that i found myself alone in the classic dining room of no. 10, downing street, while my host was finishing his toilet. presently he appeared, clad in a grey suit, smart and smiling, with no sign at all that he bore the weight of the great european war upon his shoulders. nothing could have been more affable or democratic, for there was no servant present, and he poured out the tea, while i, from a side table, brought the bacon and eggs for both. he had certainly the celtic power of making one absolutely at one’s ease, for there was no trace at all of pomp or ceremony--just a pleasant, smiling, grey-haired but very virile gentleman, with twinkling eyes and a roguish smile. no doubt there are other aspects, but that is how he presented himself that morning. he began by talking about the great loss which the country had sustained in lord kitchener’s death, speaking of him in a very kindly and human way. at the same time he was of opinion that long tropical service and the habit of always talking down to subordinates had had some effect upon his mind and character. he was a strange mixture of rather morose inactivity and sudden flashes of prevision which amounted to genius. he was the only man who had clearly foreseen the length of the war, and but for turkey, bulgaria, and other complications he probably overstated it at three years. there were times when he became so dictatorial as to be almost unbearable, and he had to be reminded at a cabinet council by lloyd george himself that he was in the presence of twenty men who were his peers, and that he could not refuse them information or act above their heads. i confess that it struck me as very natural that a big man with vital knowledge in his brain should hesitate in a world crisis to confide it to twenty men, and probably twenty wives, each of whom was a possible leak. in spite of his genius kitchener was not accessible to new ideas. he could not see clearly why such enormous munitions were necessary. he opposed tanks. he was against the irish and welsh separate divisions. he refused the special flags which the ladies had worked for these divisions. he was as remote from sentiment as a steam hammer, and yet he was dealing with humans who can be influenced by sentiment. he obstructed in many things, particularly in the dardanelles. on the other hand, his steps in organizing the new armies were splendid, though he had attempted--vainly--to do away with the territorials, another example of his blindness to the practical force of sentiment. miss asquith had said of him, “if he is not a great man he is a great poster,” and certainly no one else could have moved the nation to such a degree, though the long series of provocations from the germans had made us very receptive and combative. lloyd george was justly proud of the splendid work of the welsh division at the front. he had been to mametz wood, the taking of which had been such a bloody, and also such a glorious, business. he listened with interest to an account which i was able to give him of some incidents in that fight, and said that it was a beautiful story. he had arranged for a welsh painter to do the scene of the battle. he was interested to hear how i had worked upon my history, and remarked that it was probably better done from direct human documents than from filed papers. he asked me whether i had met many of the divisional generals, and on my saying that i had, he asked me if any had struck me as outstanding among their fellows. i said i thought they were a fine level lot, but that in soldiering it was impossible to say by mere talk or appearance who was the big man at a pinch. he agreed. he seemed to have a particular feeling towards general tom bridges, of the 19th division, and shortly afterwards i noticed that he was chosen for the american mission. i talked to him about my views as to the use of armour, and found him very keen upon it. he is an excellent listener, and seems honestly interested in what you say. he said he had no doubt that in the problem of armour lay the future of warfare, but how to carry it was the crux. he said that the soldiers always obstructed the idea--which was my experience also--with a few notable exceptions. i mentioned general watts of the 7th division as being interested in armour, and he agreed and seemed to know all about watts who, though a “dug-out,” was one of the finds of the war. he was much excited about the revolution in russia, news of which had only just come through. the guards had turned, and that meant that all had turned. the tsar was good but weak. the general character and probable fate of the tsarina were not unlike those of marie antoinette--in fact, the whole course of events was very analogous to the french revolution. “then it will last some years and end in a napoleon,” said i. he agreed. the revolt, he said, was in no sense pro-german. the whole affair had been byzantine, and reminded one of the old histories. as i left he came back to armour, and said that he was about to see some one on that very subject. when i was in the hall it struck me that a few definite facts which i had in my head would be useful in such an interview, so, to the surprise of the butler, i sat down on the hall chair and wrote out on a scrap of paper a few headings which i asked him to give the prime minister. i don’t know if they were of any use. i came away reassured, and feeling that a vigorous virile hand was at the helm. i had not expected to see any more actual operations of the war, but early in september, 1918, i had an intimation from the australian government that i might visit their section of the line. little did i think that this would lead to my seeing the crowning battle of the war. it was on september 26 that we actually started, the party consisting of sir joseph cook, naval minister of the australian commonwealth, commander latham, his aide-de-camp, who in civil life is a rising barrister of melbourne, and mr. berry, soon to be sir william berry, proprietor of the “sunday times.” we crossed in a gale of wind, with a destroyer sheeted in foam on either side of the leave boat, each of us being obliged to wear life-belts. several american newspaper men were on board, one of them an old friend, bok, of the “ladies’ home journal.” it was too late to continue our journey when we got across, so we stayed at an inn that night, and were off to the australian line at an early hour in the morning, our way lying through abbeville and amiens. the latter place was nearly deserted and very badly knocked about, far more so than i had expected. the enemy had, as we knew, been within seven miles of amiens--it was the australian line which held the town safe, and the allied cause from desperate peril if not ruin. it did not surprise us, therefore, that we soon came upon signs of fighting. a little grove was shown us as the absolute farthest ripple of the advanced german wave. a little farther on was the sheltered town of villers brettoneux, with piles of empty cartridge cases at every corner to show where snipers or machine guns had lurked. a little farther on a truly monstrous gun--the largest i have ever seen--lay near the road, broken into three pieces. it was bigger to my eyes than the largest on our battleships, and had been brought up and mounted by the germans just before the tide had turned, which was on july 5. in their retreat they had been compelled to blow it up. a party of british guardsmen were standing round it examining it, and i exchanged a few words with them. then we ran on through ground which was intensely interesting to me, as it was the scene of gough’s retreat, and i had just been carefully studying it at home. there was the somme on our left, a very placid, slow-moving stream, and across it the higher ground where our iii corps had been held up on the historical august 8, the day which made ludendorff realize, as he himself states, that the war was lost. on the plain over which we were moving the australian and canadian divisions had swept, with the tanks leading the british line, as boadicea’s chariots did of old. though i had not been over the ground before, i had visualized it so clearly in making notes about the battle that i could name every hamlet and locate every shattered church tower. presently a hill rose on the left, which i knew to be mount st. quentin, the taking of which by the australians was one of the feats of the war. it had been defended by picked troops, including some of the prussian guards, but they were mostly taken or killed, though a flanking attack by the british yeomanry division had something to do with the result. the old walled town of peronne, sacred for ever to sir walter, quentin durward, and the archers of the scots guards, lay before us, almost if not quite surrounded by the river, the canal, and broad moats. it seemed an impossible place to take, which is of course the greatest possible trap in modern warfare, since something occurring fifty miles away may place troops behind you and cut you off. here our long drive finished, and we were handed over to the care of colonel bennett commanding the camp, a tall, bluff warrior who, if he had doffed his khaki and got into a velvet tunic, would have been the exact image of the veteran warrior in scott’s novel. he was indeed a veteran, having fought, if i remember right, not only in south africa, but even in the australian suakim contingent. a little wooden hut was put at our disposal, and there we slept, sir joseph cook and i, with a small partition between us. i was bitterly cold, and so i can tell was he, for i could hear him tossing about just as i did for warmth. we had neither of us made the discovery that you may pile all the clothes you like on the top of you, but so long as there is only one layer of canvas beneath you, you are likely to be cold. we don’t usually realize that the mattress is also part of the bed-clothes. we both got little sleep that night. next morning, september 28, we were off betimes, for we had much to see, the old town for one thing, which i vowed i would visit again in time of peace. we descended mount st. quentin and saw ample evidence of the grim struggle that had occurred there. there were many rude graves, some of them with strange inscriptions. one of them, i was told, read: “here lies a german who met two diggers.” the australian tommy was of course universally known as a digger. they make a rough, valiant, sporting but rude-handed crew. they went through the prisoners for loot, and even the officers were ransacked. colonel bennett told me that a colonel of the germans was impudent when he came into his presence, so bennett said: “mend your manners, or i will hand you over to the diggers!” they were waiting outside the tent for just such a chance. one german had an iron cross which was snatched from him by an australian. the german shaped up to the man in excellent form and knocked him down. the other australians were delighted, gave him back his cross, and made him quite a hero. i expect the looter had been an unpopular man. the younger australian officers were all promoted from the ranks, and many of them had their own ideas about english grammar. bennett told me that he tried to get the reports better written. one subaltern had reported: “as i came round the traverse i met a bosch and we both reached for our guns, but he lost his block and i got him.” bennett returned this for emendation. it came back: “as i came round the traverse i met a german, and we both drew our automatic pistols, but he lost his presence of mind and i shot him.” i think i like the first style best. i lunched that day at the head-quarters of sir john monash, an excellent soldier who had done really splendid work, especially since the advance began. indeed, it was his own action on july 5 which turned the tide of retreat. he showed that the long line of fighting jews which began with joshua still carries on. one of the australian divisional generals, rosenthal, was also a jew, and the head-quarters staff was full of eagle-nosed, black-haired warriors. it spoke well for them and well also for the perfect equality of the australian system, which would have the best man at the top, be he who he might. my brother was acting as assistant adjutant-general to general butler with the iii british corps on the left of the australians, and they had kindly wired for him, so that i had the joy of having him next me at lunch, and he invited me to join the head-quarters mess of his corps for dinner. it was a wonderful experience that dinner. the great advance was to be next morning, when it was hoped that the hindenburg line, which was practically the frontier of germany, would be carried. there were only six who dined in that little farm-house messroom: butler himself with hard composed face, his head of sappers, head of gunners, my brother, the first and second staff officers, a little group of harassed and weary men. yet there was no word of the huge drama upon the edge of which we were standing. every now and then a telephone tinkled in the next room, a staff officer rose, there were a few short words, a nod, and the incident was closed. it was a wonderful example of quiet self-control. i said to my brother, when we were alone: “don’t you think i am out of the picture at such a moment talking about such frivolous things?” “for god’s sake keep on at it,” he said. “it is just what they need. give their brains something new.” so i tried to do so and we had a memorable evening. i shall never forget the drive back of ten miles in a pitch-dark night, with not a gleam anywhere save that far aloft two little gold points glimmered now and again, like the far-off headlights of a motor transferred suddenly to the heavens. these were british aeroplanes, so lit to distinguish them from the german marauders. the whole eastern horizon was yellow-red with gun-fire, and the distant roar of the artillery preparation was like the atlantic surge upon a rock-bound coast. along the road no lights were permitted, and several times out of the black a still blacker gloom framed itself into some motor-lorry with which only our cries saved a collision. it was wonderful and awesome, the eve of the day of judgment when germany’s last solid defence was to be smashed, and she was to be left open to that vengeance which she had so long provoked. we were awakened early, part of our party getting away to some point which they imagined would be more adventurous than that to which we seniors should be invited, though in the sequel it hardly proved so. they saw much, however, and one of them described to me how one of the first and saddest sights was that of eighteen splendid young americans lying dead and lonely by the roadside, caught in some unlucky shell burst. mr. cook, commander latham, and i had been placed under the charge of captain plunket, a twice-wounded australian officer, who helped us much during the varied adventures of our exciting day. the general programme of attack was already in our minds. two american divisions, the 27th and 30th, one from new york, the other from the south, were to rush the front line. the australian divisions were then to pass over or through them and carry the battle-front forward. already, as we arrived on the battle-field, the glad news came back that the americans had done their part, and that the australians had just been unleashed. also that the germans were standing to it like men. as our car threaded the crowded street between the ruins of templeux we met the wounded coming back, covered cars with nothing visible save protruding boots, and a constant stream of pedestrians, some limping, some with bandaged arms and faces, some supported by red cross men, a few in pain, most of them smiling grimly behind their cigarettes. amid them came the first clump of prisoners, fifty or more, pitiable enough, and yet i could not pity them, the weary, shuffling, hang-dog creatures, with no touch of nobility in their features or their bearing. the village was full of americans and australians, extraordinarily like each other in type. one could well have lingered, for it was all of great interest, but there were even greater interests ahead, so we turned up a hill, left our car, which had reached its limit, and proceeded on foot. the road took us through a farm, where a british anti-aircraft battery stood ready for action. then we found open plain, and went forward, amid old trenches and rusty wire, in the direction of the battle. we had now passed the heavy gun positions, and were among the field guns, so that the noise was deafening. a british howitzer battery was hard at work, and we stopped to chat with the major. his crews had been at it for six hours, but were in great good humour, and chuckled mightily when the blast of one of their guns nearly drove in our ear-drums, we having got rather too far forward. the effect was that of a ringing box on the exposed ear--with which valediction we left our grinning british gunners and pushed on to the east, under a screaming canopy of our own shells. the wild, empty waste of moor was broken by a single shallow quarry or gravel-pit, in which we could see some movement. in it we found an advanced dressing station, with about a hundred american and australian gunners and orderlies. there were dug-outs in the sides of this flat excavation, and it had been an american battalion head-quarters up to a few hours before. we were now about 1,000 yards from the hindenburg line, and i learned with emotion that this spot was the egg redoubt, one of those advanced outposts of general gough’s army which suffered so tragic and glorious a fate in that great military epic of march 21--one of the grandest in the whole war. the fact that we were now actually standing in the egg redoubt showed me, as nothing else could have done, how completely the ground had been recovered, and how the day of retribution was at hand. we were standing near the eastward lip of the excavation, and looking over it, when it was first brought to our attention that it took two to make a battle. up to now we had seen only one. now two shells burst in quick succession forty yards in front of us, and a spray of earth went into the air. “whizz-bangs,” remarked our soldier-guide casually. personally, i felt less keenly interested in their name than in the fact that they were there at all. we thought we had done pretty well to get within 1,000 yards of the famous line, but now came a crowning bit of good fortune, for an australian gunner captain, a mere lad, but a soldier from his hawk’s eyes to his active feet, volunteered to rush us forward to some coign of vantage known to himself. so it was eastward ho! once more, still over a dull, barren plain sloping gently upwards, with little sign of life. here and there was the quick fluff of a bursting shell, but at a comfortable distance. suddenly ahead of us a definite object broke the skyline. it was a tank, upon which the crew were working with spanners and levers, for its comrades were now far ahead, and it would fain follow. this, it seems, was the grandstand which our young gunner had selected. on to the top of it we clambered--and there, at our very feet, and less than 500 yards away, was the rift which had been torn a few hours before in the hindenburg line. on the dun slope beyond it, under our very eyes, was even now being fought a part of that great fight where at last the children of light were beating down into the earth the forces of darkness. it was there. we could see it. and yet how little there was to see! the ridge was passed, and the ground sloped down, as dark and heathy as hindhead. in front of us lay a village. it was bellicourt. the hindenburg position ran through it. it lay quiet enough, and with the unaided eye one could see rusty red fields of wire in front of it. but the wire had availed nothing, nor had the trench that lurked behind it, for beyond it, beside the village of nauroy, there was a long white line, clouds of pale steam-like vapour spouting up against a dark, rain-sodden sky. “the boche smoke barrage,” said our guide. “they are going to counter-attack.” only this, the long, white, swirling cloud upon the dark plain told of the strife in front of us. with my glasses i saw what looked like tanks, but whether wrecked or in action i could not say. there was the battle--the greatest of battles--but nowhere could i see a moving figure. it is true that all the noises of the pit seemed to rise from that lonely landscape, but noise was always with us, go where we would. the australians were ahead where that line of smoke marked their progress. in the sloping fields, which at that point emerged out of the moor, the victorious americans, who had done their part, were crouching. it was an assured victory upon which we gazed, achieved so rapidly that we were ourselves standing far forward in ground which had been won that day. the wounded had been brought in, and i saw no corpses. on the left the fight was very severe, and the germans, who had been hidden in their huge dug-outs, were doing their usual trick of emerging and cutting off the attack. so much we gathered afterwards, but for the moment it was the panorama before us which was engrossing all our thoughts. suddenly the german guns woke up. i can but pray that it was not our group which drew their fire upon the half-mended tank. shell after shell fell in its direction, all of them short, but creeping forward with each salvo. it was time for us to go. if any man says that without a call of duty he likes being under aimed shell-fire, he is not a man whose word i would trust. some of the shells burst with a rusty-red outflame, and we were told that they were gas shells. i may say that before we were admitted on to the battle-field at all, we were ushered one by one into a room where some devil’s pipkin was bubbling in the corner, and were taught to use our gas-masks by the simple expedient of telling us that if we failed to acquire the art then and there a very painful alternative was awaiting us. we made our way back, with no indecent haste, but certainly without loitering, across the plain, the shells always getting rather nearer, until we came to the excavation. here we had a welcome rest, for our good gunner took us into his cubby-hole of a dug-out, which would at least stop shrapnel, and we shared his tea and dried beef, a true australian soldier’s meal. the german fire was now rather heavy, and our expert host explained that this meant that he had recovered from the shock of the attack, had reorganized his guns, and was generally his merry self once more. from where we sat we could see heavy shells bursting far to our rear, and there was an atmosphere of explosion all round us, which might have seemed alarming had it not been for the general chatty afternoon-tea appearance of all these veteran soldiers with whom it was our privilege to find ourselves. a group of sulky-looking german prisoners sat in a corner, while a lank and freckled australian soldier, with his knee sticking out of a rent in his trousers, was walking about with four watches dangling from his hand, endeavouring vainly to sell them. far be it from me to assert that he did not bring the watches from sydney and choose this moment for doing a deal in them, but they were heavy old teutonic time-pieces, and the prisoners seemed to take a rather personal interest in them. as we started on our homeward track we came, first, upon the british battery which seemed to be limbering up with some idea of advancing, and so lost its chance of administering a box on our other ear. farther still we met our friends of the air guns, and stopped again to exchange a few impressions. they had nothing to fire at, and seemed bored to tears, for the red, white and blue machines were in full command of the sky. soon we found our motor waiting in the lee of a ruined house, and began to thread our way back through the wonderfully picturesque streams of men--american, australian, british, and german--who were strung along the road. and then occurred a very horrible incident. one knew, of course, that one could not wander about a battle-field and not find oneself sooner or later involved in some tragedy, but we were now out of range of any but heavy guns, and their shots were spasmodic. we had halted the car for an instant to gather up two german helmets which commander latham had seen on the roadside, when there was a very heavy burst close ahead round a curve in the village street. a geyser of red brick-dust flew up into the air. an instant later our car rounded the corner. none of us will forget what we saw. there was a tangle of mutilated horses, their necks rising and sinking. beside them a man with his hand blown off was staggering away, the blood gushing from his upturned sleeve. he was moving round and holding the arm raised and hanging, as a dog holds an injured foot. beside the horses lay a shattered man, drenched crimson from head to foot, with two great glazed eyes looking upwards through a mask of blood. two comrades were at hand to help, and we could only go upon our way with the ghastly picture stamped for ever upon our memory. the image of that dead driver might well haunt one in one’s dreams. once through templeux and on the main road for peronne things became less exciting, and we drew up to see a column of 900 prisoners pass us. each side of the causeway was lined by australians, with their keen, clear-cut, falcon faces, and between lurched these heavy-jawed, beetle-browed, uncouth louts, new caught and staring round with bewildered eyes at their debonnaire captors. i saw none of that relief at getting out of it which i have read of; nor did i see any signs of fear, but the prevailing impression was an ox-like stolidity and dullness. it was a herd of beasts, not a procession of men. it was indeed farcical to think that these uniformed bumpkins represented the great military nation, while the gallant figures who lined the road belonged to the race which they had despised as being unwarlike. time and fate between them have a pretty sense of humour. one of them caught my eye as he passed and roared out in guttural english, “the old jairman is out!” they were the only words i heard them speak. french cavalry troopers, stern, dignified, and martial, rode at either end of the bedraggled procession. they were great soldiers, these australians. i think they would admit it themselves, but a spectator is bound to confirm it. there was a reckless dare-devilry, combined with a spice of cunning, which gave them a place of their own in the imperial ranks. they had a great advantage too, in having a permanent organization, the same five divisions always in the same corps, under the same chief. it doubled their military value--and the same applied equally, of course, to the canadians. none the less, they should not undervalue their british comrades or lose their sense of proportion. i had a chance of addressing some 1,200 of them on our return that evening, and while telling them all that i thought of their splendid deeds, i ventured to remind them that 72 per cent of the men engaged and 76 per cent of the casualties were englishmen of england. i think that now, in these after-war days, the whole world needs to be reminded of this fact as well as the australians did. there has been, it seems to me, a systematic depreciation of what the glorious english, apart from the british, soldiers did. england is too big to be provincial, and smaller minds sometimes take advantage of it. at the time some of the australian papers slanged me for having given this speech to their soldiers, but i felt that it needed saying, and several of their officers thanked me warmly, saying that as they never saw anything save their own front, they were all of them losing their sense of proportion. i shall not easily forget that speech, i standing on a mound in the rain, the australian soldiers with cloaks swathed round them like brigands, and half a dozen aeroplanes, returning from the battle, circling overhead, evidently curious as to what was going on. it seems to me now like some extraordinary dream. such was my scamper to the australian front. it was as if some huge hand had lifted me from my study table, placed me where i could see what i was writing about, and then within four days laid me down once more before the familiar table, with one more wonderful experience added to my record. and then at last came the blessed day of armistice. i was in a staid london hotel at eleven o’clock in the morning, most prim of all the hours of the day, when a lady, well-dressed and conventional, came through the turning doors, waltzed slowly round the hall with a flag in either hand, and departed without saying a word. it was the first sign that things were happening. i rushed out into the streets, and of course the news was everywhere at once. i walked down to buckingham palace and saw the crowds assembling there, singing and cheering. a slim, young girl had got elevated on to some high vehicle, and was leading and conducting the singing as if she was some angel in tweeds just dropped from a cloud. in the dense crowd i saw an open motor stop with four middle-aged men, one of them a hard-faced civilian, the others officers. i saw this civilian hack at the neck of a whisky bottle and drink it raw. i wish the crowd had lynched him. it was the moment for prayer, and this beast was a blot on the landscape. on the whole the people were very good and orderly. later more exuberant elements got loose. they say that it was when the australian wounded met the war office flappers that the foundations of solid old london got loosened. but we have little to be ashamed of, and if ever folk rejoiced we surely had the right to do so. we did not see the new troubles ahead of us, but at least these old ones were behind. and we had gained an immense reassurance. britain had not weakened. she was still the britain of old. chapter xxxii the psychic quest i have not obtruded the psychic question upon the reader, though it has grown in importance with the years, and has now come to absorb the whole energy of my life. i cannot, however, close these scattered memories of my adventures in thought and action without some reference, however incomplete, to that which has been far the most important thing in my life. it is the thing for which every preceding phase, my gradual religious development, my books, which gave me an introduction to the public, my modest fortune, which enables me to devote myself to unlucrative work, my platform work, which helps me to convey the message, and my physical strength, which is still sufficient to stand arduous tours and to fill the largest halls for an hour and a half with my voice, have each and all been an unconscious preparation. for thirty years i have trained myself exactly for the rôle without the least inward suspicion of whither i was tending. i cannot in the limited space of a chapter go into very lengthy detail or complete argument upon the subject. it is the more unnecessary since i have already in my psychic volumes outlined very clearly how i arrived at my present knowledge. of these volumes the first and second, called respectively “the new revelation” and “the vital message,” show how gradual evidence was given me of the continuation of life, and how thorough and long were my studies before i was at last beaten out of my material agnostic position and forced to admit the validity of the proofs. in the days of universal sorrow and loss, when the voice of rachel was heard throughout the land, it was borne in upon me that the knowledge which had come to me thus was not for my own consolation alone, but that god had placed me in a very special position for conveying it to that world which needed it so badly. i found in the movement many men who saw the truth as clearly as i did; but such was the clamour of the “religious,” who were opposing that which is the very essence of living religion, of the “scientific,” who broke the first laws of science by pronouncing upon a thing which they had not examined, and of the press, who held up every real or imaginary rascality as being typical of a movement which they had never understood, that the true men were abashed and shrank from the public exposition of their views. it was to combat this that i began a campaign in 1916 which can only finish when all is finished. one grand help i had. my wife had always been averse from my psychic studies, deeming the subject to be uncanny and dangerous. her own experiences soon convinced her to the contrary, for her brother, who was killed at mons, came back to us in a very convincing way. from that instant she threw herself with all the whole-hearted energy of her generous nature into the work which lay before us. a devoted mother, she was forced often to leave her children; a lover of home, she was compelled to quit it for many months at a time; distrustful of the sea, she joyfully shared my voyages. we have now travelled a good 50,000 miles upon our quest. we have spoken face to face with a quarter of a million of people. her social qualities, her clear sanity, her ardent charity, and her gracious presence upon the platforms all united with her private counsel and sympathy, have been such an aid to me that they have turned my work into a joy. the presence of our dear children upon our journeys has also lightened them for both of us. i began our public expositions of the subject by three years of intermittent lecturing in my country, during which period i visited nearly every town of importance, many of them twice and thrice. everywhere i found attentive audiences, critical, as they should be, but open to conviction. i roused antagonism only in those who had not heard me, and there were demonstrations outside the doors, but never in the halls. i cannot remember a single interruption during that long series of addresses. it was interesting to notice how i was upheld, for though i was frequently very weary before the address, and though my war lectures had often been attended by palpitation of the heart, i was never once conscious of any fatigue during or after a lecture upon psychic subjects. on august 13, 1920, we started for australia. in proportion to her population she had lost almost as heavily as we during the war, and i felt that my seed would fall upon fruitful ground. i have written all details of this episode in my “wanderings of a spiritualist,” in which the reader will find among other things some evidences of that preternatural help which went with us in our journeys. i addressed large audiences in all the big towns of australia and new zealand. an unfortunate shipping strike prevented me from reaching tasmania, but otherwise the venture was an unalloyed success. contrary to expectation i was able to pay all the expenses of our large party (we were seven) and to leave a balance behind me to help the successor whom i might choose. at the end of march, 1921, we were back in paris again, where, greatly daring, i lectured in french upon psychic subjects. our stay at home was not a very long one, for urgent invitations had come from america, where the spiritual movement had fallen into a somewhat languishing state. on april 1, 1922, our whole party started for the states. what happened to us i have recorded in “our american adventure.” suffice it to say that the trip was very successful, and that from boston to washington, and from new york to chicago, i spoke in all the larger cities and brought about a great revival of interest in the subject. we were back in england at the beginning of july, 1922. i was by no means satisfied about america, however, as we had not touched the great west, the land of the future. therefore we set forth again in march, 1923, getting back in august. our adventures, which were remarkable upon the psychic side, are recorded in “our second american adventure.” when i returned from that journey i had travelled 55,000 miles in three years, and spoken to quarter of a million of people. i am still unsatisfied, however, for the southern states of the union have not been touched, and it is possible that we may yet make a journey in that direction. i have placed on record our experiences, and no doubt they have little interest at the moment for the general public, but the day will come, and that speedily, when people will understand that this proposition for which we are now fighting is far the most important thing for two thousand years in the history of the world, and when the efforts of the pioneers will have a very real interest to all who have sufficient intelligence to follow the progress of human thought. i am only one of many working for the cause, but i hope that i may claim that i brought into it a combative and aggressive spirit which it lacked before, and which has now so forced it upon public attention that one can hardly pick up a paper without reading some comment upon it. if some of these papers are hopelessly ignorant and prejudiced, it is not a bad thing for the cause. if you have a bad case, constant publicity is a misfortune, but if you have a good one, its goodness will always assert itself, however much it may be misrepresented. many spiritualists have taken the view that since we know these comforting and wonderful things, and since the world chooses not to examine the evidence, we may be content with our own happy assurance. this seems to me an immoral view. if god has sent a great new message of exceeding joy down to earth, then it is for us, to whom it has been clearly revealed, to pass it on at any cost of time, money and labour. it is not given to us for selfish enjoyment, but for general consolation. if the sick man turns from the physician, then it cannot be helped, but at least the healing draught should be offered. the greater the difficulty in breaking down the wall of apathy, ignorance and materialism, the more is it a challenge to our manhood to attack and ever attack in the same bulldog spirit with which foch faced the german lines. i trust that the record of my previous life will assure the reader that i have within my limitations preserved a sane and balanced judgment, since i have never hitherto been extreme in my views, and since what i have said has so often been endorsed by the actual course of events. but never have i said anything with the same certainty of conviction with which i now say that this new knowledge is going to sweep the earth and to revolutionize human views upon every topic save only on fundamental morality, which is a fixed thing. all modern inventions and discoveries will sink into insignificance beside those psychic facts which will force themselves within a few years upon the universal human mind. the subject has been obscured by the introduction of all sorts of side issues, some of interest but not vital, others quite irrelevant. there is a class of investigator who loves to wander round in a circle, and to drag you with him if you are weak enough to accept such guidance. he trips continually over his own brains, and can never persuade himself that the simple and obvious explanation is also the true one. his intellect becomes a positive curse to him, for he uses it to avoid the straight road and to fashion out some strange devious path which lands him at last in a quagmire, whilst the direct and honest mind has kept firmly to the highway of knowledge. when i meet men of this type, and then come in contact with the lowly congregations of religious spiritualists, i think always of christ’s words when he thanked god that he had revealed these things to babes and withheld them from the wise and the prudent. i think also of a dictum of baron reichenbach: “there is a scientific incredulity which exceeds in stupidity the obtuseness of the clodhopper.” but what i say in no way applies to the reasonable researcher whose experiences are real stepping-stones leading to his fixed conclusion. there must to every man be this novitiate in knowledge. the matter is too serious to be taken without due intellectual conviction. it must not be imagined that i entirely deny the existence of fraud. but it is far less common than is supposed, and as for its being universal, which is the theory of the conjurers and some other critics, such an opinion is beyond reason or argument. in an experience with mediums which has been excelled by very few living men, and which has embraced three continents, i have not encountered fraud more than three or four times. there is conscious and unconscious fraud, and it is the existence of the latter which complicates the question so badly. conscious fraud usually arises from a temporary failure of real psychic power, and a consequent attempt to replace it by an imitation. unconscious fraud comes in that curious halfway state which i have called the “half-trance condition” when the medium seems normal, and yet is actually hardly responsible for his actions. at such a time the process by which his personality leaves his body seems to have set in, and his higher qualities have already passed, so that he can apparently no longer inhibit the promptings received from the suggestion of those around him, or from his own unchecked desires. thus one will find mediums doing stupid and obvious things which expose them to the charge of cheating. then if the observer disregards these and waits, the true psychic phenomena of unmistakable character will follow as he sinks more deeply into trance. this was, i gather, noticeable in the case of eusapia paladino, but i have seen it with several others. in those cases where a medium has left the cabinet, and is found wandering about among the sitters, as has happened with mrs. corner, with madame d’esperance, and with craddock--all of them mediums who have given many proofs of their real powers--i am convinced that the very natural supposition that they are fraudulent is really quite a mistaken one. when, on the other hand, it is found that the medium has introduced false drapery or accessories, which has sometimes occurred, we are in the presence of the most odious and blasphemous crime which a human being can commit. people ask me, not unnaturally, what it is which makes me so perfectly certain that this thing is true. that i am perfectly certain is surely demonstrated by the mere fact that i have abandoned my congenial and lucrative work, left my home for long periods at a time, and subjected myself to all sorts of inconveniences, losses, and even insults, in order to get the facts home to the people. to give all my reasons would be to write a book rather than a chapter, but i may say briefly that there is no physical sense which i possess which has not been separately assured, and that there is no conceivable method by which a spirit could show its presence which i have not on many occasions experienced. in the presence of miss besinnet as medium and of several witnesses i have seen my mother and my nephew, young oscar hornung, as plainly as ever i saw them in life--so plainly that i could almost have counted the wrinkles of the one and the freckles of the other. in the darkness the face of my mother shone up, peaceful, happy, slightly inclined to one side, the eyes closed. my wife upon my right and the lady upon my left both saw it as clearly as i did. the lady had not known my mother in life but she said, “how wonderfully like she is to her son,” which will show how clear was the detail of the features. on another occasion my son came back to me. six persons heard his conversation with me, and signed a paper afterwards to that effect. it was in his voice and concerned itself with what was unknown to the medium, who was bound and breathing deeply in his chair. if the evidence of six persons of standing and honour may not be taken, then how can any human fact be established? my brother, general doyle, came back with the same medium, but on another occasion. he discussed the health of his widow. she was a danish lady, and he wanted her to use a masseur in copenhagen. he gave the name. i made inquiries and found that such a man did exist. whence came this knowledge? who was it who took so close an interest in the health of this lady? if it was not her dead husband then who was it? all fine-drawn theories of the subconscious go to pieces before the plain statement of the intelligence, “i am a spirit. i am innes. i am your brother.” i have clasped materialized hands. i have held long conversations with the direct voice. i have smelt the peculiar ozone-like smell of ectoplasm. i have listened to prophecies which were quickly fulfilled. i have seen the “dead” glimmer up upon a photographic plate which no hand but mine had touched. i have received through the hand of my own wife, notebooks full of information which was utterly beyond her ken. i have seen heavy articles swimming in the air, untouched by human hand, and obeying directions given to unseen operators. i have seen spirits walk round the room in fair light and join in the talk of the company. i have known an untrained woman, possessed by an artist spirit, to produce rapidly a picture, now hanging in my drawing-room, which few living painters could have bettered. i have read books which might have come from great thinkers and scholars, and which were actually written by unlettered men who acted as the medium of the unseen intelligence, so superior to his own. i have recognized the style of a dead writer which no parodist could have copied, and which was written in his own handwriting. i have heard singing beyond earthly power, and whistling done with no pause for the intake of breath. i have seen objects from a distance projected into a room with closed doors and windows. if a man could see, hear, and feel all this, and yet remain unconvinced of unseen intelligent forces around him, he would have good cause to doubt his own sanity. why should he heed the chatter of irresponsible journalists, or the head-shaking of inexperienced men of science, when he has himself had so many proofs? they are babies in this matter, and should be sitting at his feet. it is not, however, a question to be argued in a detached and impersonal way, as if one were talking of the baconian theory or the existence of atlantis. it is intimate, personal, and vital to the last degree. a closed mind means an earthbound soul, and that in turn means future darkness and misery. if you know what is coming, you can avoid it. if you do not, you run grave risk. some jeremiah or savonarola is needed who will shriek this into the ears of the world. a new conception of sin is needed. the mere carnal frailties of humanity, the weaknesses of the body, are not to be lightly condoned, but are not the serious part of the human reckoning. it is the fixed condition of mind, narrowness, bigotry, materialism--in a word, the sins not of the body, but of the spirit, which are the real permanent things, and condemn the individual to the lower spheres until he has learnt his lesson. we know this from our rescue circles when these poor souls come back to bewail their errors and to learn those truths which they might have learnt here, had their minds not been closed by apathy or prejudice. the radical mistake which science has made in investigating the subject is that it has never troubled to grasp the fact that it is not the medium who is producing the phenomena. it has always treated him as if he were a conjurer, and said, “do this or do that,” failing to understand that little or nothing comes _from_ him, but all or nearly all comes _through_ him. i say “nearly” all, for i believe that some simple phenomena, such as the rap, can within limits be produced by the medium’s own will. it is this false view of science which has prevented sceptics from realizing that a gentle and receptive state of mind on the part of sitters and an easy natural atmosphere for the medium are absolutely essential in order to produce harmony with the outside forces. if in the greatest of all séances, that of the upper room on the day of pentecost, an aggressive sceptic had insisted upon test conditions of his own foolish devising, where would the rushing wind and the tongues of fire have been? “all with one accord,” says the writer of the acts of the apostles, and that is the essential condition. i have sat with saintly people, and i too have felt the rushing wind, seen the flickering tongues and heard the great voice, but how could such results come where harmony did not reign? that is the radical mistake which science has made. men know well that even in her own coarse, material work the presence of a scrap of metal may upset the whole balance of a great magnetic installation, and yet they will not take the word of those who are in a position to speak from experience that a psychic condition may upset a psychic experiment. but indeed when we speak of science in this connection it is a confusion of thought. the fact that a man is a great zoologist like lankester, or a great physicist like tyndall or faraday, does not give his opinion any weight in a subject which is outside his own specialty. there is many an unknown smith and jones whose twenty years of practical work have put him in a far stronger position than that of these intolerant scientists; while as to the real spiritualist leaders, men of many experiences and much reading and thought, it is they who are the real scientific experts who are in a position to teach the world. one does not lose one’s judgment when one becomes a spiritualist. one is as much a researcher as ever, but one understands better what it is that one is studying and how to study it. this controversy with bumptious and ignorant people is a mere passing thing which matters nothing. the real controversy, which does matter very much, is with the continental school who study ectoplasm and other semi-material manifestations, but who have not got the length of seeing independent spirit behind them. richet, schrenck-notzing and other great investigators are still in this midway position, and flammarion is little more advanced. richet goes the length of admitting that he has assured himself by personal observation of the materialized form that it can walk and talk and leave moulds of its hands. so far he has gone. and yet even now he clings to the idea that these phenomena may be the externalization of some latent powers of the human body and mind. such an explanation seems to me to be the desperate defence of the last trench by one of those old-time materialists, who say with brewster: “spirit is the last thing which we will concede,” adding as their reason “it upsets the work of fifty years.” it is hard when a man has taught all his life that the brain governs spirit to have to learn after all that it may be spirit which acts independently of the human brain. but it is their super-materialism which is the real difficulty with which we now have to contend. and what is the end of it all? i have no idea. how could those who first noted the electric twitching of muscles foresee the atlantic cable or the arc lamp? our information is that some great shock is coming shortly to the human race which will finally break down its apathy, and which will be accompanied by such psychic signs that the survivors will be unable any longer to deny the truths which we preach. the real meaning of our movement will then be seen, for it will become apparent that we have accustomed the public mind to such ideas, and provided a body of definite teaching, both scientific and religious, to which they can turn for guidance. as to the prophecy of disaster, i admit that we have to be on our guard. even the christ circle was woefully deceived, and declared confidently that the world would not survive their own generation. various creeds, too, have made vain predictions of the end of the world. i am keenly aware of all this, and also of the difficulty in reckoning time when seen from the other side. but, making every allowance for this, the information upon the point has been so detailed, and has reached me from so many entirely independent sources, that i have been forced to take it seriously, and to think that some great watershed of human experience may be passed within a few years--the greatest, we are told, that our long-suffering race has yet encountered. people who have not gone into the subject may well ask, “but what do you get out of it? how are you the better?” we can only answer that all life has changed to us since this definite knowledge has come. no longer are we shut in by death. we are out of the valley and up on the ridge, with vast clear vistas before us. why should we fear a death which we know for certain is the doorway to unutterable happiness? why should we fear our dear ones’ death if we can be so near to them afterwards? am i not far nearer to my son than if he were alive and serving in that army medical service which would have taken him to the ends of the earth? there is never a month, often never a week, that i do not commune with him. is it not evident that such facts as these change the whole aspect of life, and turn the grey mist of dissolution into a rosy dawn? you may say that we have already all these assurances in the christian revelation. it is true, and that is why we are not anti-christian so long as christianity is the teaching of humble christ and not of his arrogant representatives. every form of christianity is represented in our ranks, often by clergymen of the various denominations. but there is nothing precise in the definitions of the other world as given in the holy writings. the information we have depicts a heaven of congenial work and of congenial play, with every mental and physical activity of life carried on to a higher plane--a heaven of art, of science, of intellect, of organization, of combat with evil, of home circles, of flowers, of wide travel, of sports, of the mating of souls, of complete harmony. this is what our “dead” friends describe. on the other hand we hear from them, and sometimes directly, of the hells, which are temporary spheres of purification. we hear of the mists, the darkness, the aimless wanderings, the mental confusion, the remorse. “our condition is horrible,” wrote one of them to me recently at a séance. these things are real and vivid and provable to us. that is why we are an enormous force for the resuscitation of true religion, and why the clergy take a heavy responsibility when they oppose us. the final result upon scientific thought is unthinkable, save that the sources of all force would be traced rather to spiritual than to material causes. in religion one can perhaps see a little more clearly. theology and dogma would disappear. people would realize that such questions as the number of persons in god, or the process of christ’s birth, have no bearing at all upon the development of man’s spirit, which is the sole object of life. all religions would be equal, for all alike produce gentle, unselfish souls who are god’s elect. christian, jew, buddhist, and mohammedan would shed their distinctive doctrines, follow their own high teachers on a common path of morality, and forget all that antagonism which has made religion a curse rather than a blessing to the world. we shall be in close touch with other-world forces, and knowledge will supersede that faith which has in the past planted a dozen different signposts to point in as many different directions. such will be the future, so far as i can dimly see it, and all this will spring from the seed which now we tend and water amid the cold blasts of a hostile world. do not let it be thought that i claim any special leadership in this movement. i do what i can, but many others have done what they could--many humble workers who have endured loss and insult, but who will come to be recognized as the modern apostles. for my part, i can only claim that i have been an instrument so fashioned that i have had some particular advantages in getting this teaching across to the people. that is the work which will occupy, either by voice or pen, the remainder of my life. what immediate shape it will take i cannot say. human plans are vain things, and it is better for the tool to lie passive until the great hand moves it once more.
﻿ i the adventure of the illustrious client "it can't hurt now," was mr. sherlock holmes's comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, i asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. so it was that at last i obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend's career. both holmes and i had a weakness for the turkish bath. it was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that i have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. on the upper floor of the northumberland avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon september 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. i had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him. "it may be some fussy, self-important fool, it may be a matter of life or death," said he, as he handed me the note. "i know no more than this message tells me." it was from the carlton club, and dated the evening before. this is what i read: "sir james damery presents his compliments to mr. sherlock holmes, and will call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow. sir james begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult mr. holmes is very delicate, and also very important. he trusts, therefore, that mr. holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the carlton club." "i need not say that i have confirmed it, watson," said holmes, as i returned the paper. "do you know anything of this man damery?" "only that his name is a household word in society." "well, i can tell you a little more than that. he has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. you may remember his negotiations with sir george lewis over the hammerford will case. he is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. i am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance." "our?" "well, if you will be so good, watson." "i shall be honoured." "then you have the hour--four-thirty. until then we can put the matter out of our heads." i was living in my own rooms in queen anne street at the time, but i was round at baker street before the time named. sharp to the half-hour, colonel sir james damery was announced. it is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, clean-shaven face, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. frankness shone from his grey irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. his lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. the big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room. "of course, i was prepared to find dr. watson," he remarked, with a courteous bow. "his collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, mr. holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. i should say that there is no more dangerous man in europe." "i have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied," said holmes, with a smile. "don't you smoke? then you will excuse me if i light my pipe. if your man is more dangerous than the late professor moriarty, or than the living colonel sebastian moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. may i ask his name?" "have you ever heard of baron gruner? "you mean the austrian murderer?" colonel damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. "there is no getting past you, mr. holmes! wonderful! so you have already sized him up as a murderer?" "it is my business to follow the details of continental crime. who could possibly have read what happened at prague and have any doubts as to the man's guilt! it was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! i am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called 'accident' happened in the splügen pass as if i had seen him do it. i knew, also, that he had come to england, and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. well, what has baron gruner been up to? i presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again?" "no, it is more serious than that. to revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. it is a terrible thing, mr. holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. can a human being be placed in a more trying position?" "perhaps not." "then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests i am acting." "i did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. who is the principal?" "mr. holmes, i must beg you not to press that question. it is important that i should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. his motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. i need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. surely the actual name of your client is immaterial?" "i am sorry," said holmes. "i am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. i fear, sir james, that i must decline to act." our visitor was greatly disturbed. his large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment. "you hardly realize the effect of your own action, mr. holmes," said he. "you place me in a most serious dilemma, for i am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if i could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. may i, at least, lay all that i can before you?" "by all means, so long as it is understood that i commit myself to nothing." "that is understood. in the first place, you have no doubt heard of general de merville?" "de merville of khyber fame? yes, i have heard of him." "he has a daughter, violet de merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. it is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend." "baron gruner has some hold over her, then?" "the strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned--the hold of love. the fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. he is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact. "but how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of miss violet de merville?" "it was on a mediterranean yachting voyage. the company, though select, paid their own passages. no doubt the promoters hardly realized the baron's true character until it was too late. the villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. to say that she loves him hardly expresses it. she dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him. outside of him there is nothing on earth. she will not hear one word against him. everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. to sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. as she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her." "does she know about the austrian episode?" "the cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. she absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other." "dear me! but surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? it is no doubt general de merville." our visitor fidgeted in his chair. "i could deceive you by saying so, mr. holmes, but it would not be true. de merville is a broken man. the strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident. he has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this austrian. my client, however, is an old friend, one who has known the general intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. he cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. there is nothing in which scotland yard can act. it was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as i have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. i have no doubt, mr. holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but i must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito." holmes gave a whimsical smile. "i think i may safely promise that," said he. "i may add that your problem interests me, and that i shall be prepared to look into it. how shall i keep in touch with you?" "the carlton club will find me. but, in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, 'xx.31.'" holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee. "the baron's present address, please?" "vernon lodge, near kingston. it is a large house. he has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which, naturally, makes him a more dangerous antagonist." "is he at home at present?" "yes." "apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man?" "he has expensive tastes. he is a horse fancier. for a short time he played polo at hurlingham, but then this prague affair got noised about and he had to leave. he collects books and pictures. he is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature. he is, i believe, a recognized authority upon chinese pottery, and has written a book upon the subject." "a complex mind," said holmes. "all great criminals have that. my old friend charlie peace was a violin virtuoso. wainwright was no mean artist. i could quote many more. well, sir james, you will inform your client that i am turning my mind upon baron gruner. i can say no more. i have some sources of information of my own, and dare say we may find some means of opening matter up." when our visitor had left us, holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. at last, however, he came briskly back to earth. "well, watson, any views?" he asked. "i should think you had better see the young lady herself." "my dear watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall i, a stranger, prevail? and yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. but i think we must begin from a different angle. i rather fancy that shinwell johnson might be a help." i have not had occasion to mention shinwell johnson in these memoirs because i have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend's career. during the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. johnson, i grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at parkhurst. finally, he repented and allied himself to holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of london, and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. had johnson been a "nark" of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. with the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the _entrée_ of every night-club, doss-house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. it was to him that sherlock holmes now proposed to turn. it was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for i had some pressing professional business of my own, but i met him by appointment that evening at simpson's, where, sitting at a small table in the front window, and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the strand, he told me something of what had passed. "johnson is on the prowl," said he. "he may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man's secrets." "but, if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?" "who knows, watson? woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. baron gruner remarked to me----" "he remarked to you!" "oh, to be sure, i had not told you of my plans! well, watson, i love to come to close grips with my man. i like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. when i had given johnson his instructions, i took a cab out to kingston and found the baron in a most affable mood." "did he recognize you?" "there was no difficulty about that, for i simply sent in my card. he is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. he has breed in him, a real aristocrat of crime, with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. yes, i am glad to have had my attention called to baron adelbert gruner." "you say he was affable?" "a purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. some people's affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. his greeting was characteristic. 'i rather thought i should see you sooner or later, mr. holmes,' said he. 'you have been engaged, no doubt, by general de merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, violet. that is so, is it not?' "i acquiesced. "'my dear man,' said he, 'you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. it is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. you will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once.' "'it is curious,' i answered, 'but that was the very advice which i had intended to give you. i have a respect for your brains, baron, and the little which i have seen of your personality has not lessened it. let me put it to you as man to man. no one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. it is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made england too hot to hold you. is the game worth it? surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. it would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice.' "the baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. these quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle. "'excuse my amusement, mr. holmes,' said he, 'but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. i don't think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the same. not a colour card there, mr. holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small.' "'so you think.' "'so i know. let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that i can afford to show it. i have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. this was given to me in spite of the fact that i told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. i also told her that certain wicked and designing persons--i hope you recognize yourself--would come to her and tell her these things, and i warned her how to treat them. you have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion, mr. holmes? well, you will see how it works, for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. so she is ready for you and, i have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father's will--save only in the one little matter.' "well, watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so i took my leave with as much cold dignity as i could summon, but, as i had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me. "'by the way, mr. holmes,' said he, 'did you know le brun, the french agent?' "'yes,' said i. "'do you know what befell him?' "'i heard that he was beaten by some apaches in the montmartre district and crippled for life.' "'quite true, mr. holmes. by a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. don't do it, mr. holmes; it's not a lucky thing to do. several have found that out. my last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. good-bye!' "so there you are, watson. you are up to date now." "the fellow seems dangerous." "mighty dangerous. i disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means." "must you interfere? does it really matter if he marries the girl?" "considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, i should say it mattered very much. besides, the client! well, well, we need not discuss that. when you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe shinwell will be there with his report." we found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. it seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her. "this is miss kitty winter," said shinwell johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. "what she don't know--well, there, she'll speak for herself. put my hand right on her, mr. holmes, within an hour of your message." "i'm easy to find," said the young woman. "hell, london, gets me every time. same address for porky shinwell. we're old mates, porky, you and i. but, by gripes! there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! that is the man you are after, mr. holmes." holmes smiled. "i gather we have your good wishes, miss winter." "if i can help to put him where he belongs, i'm yours to the rattle," said our visitor, with fierce energy. there was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain. "you needn't go into my past, mr. holmes. that's neither here nor there. but what i am adelbert gruner made me. if i could pull him down!" she clutched frantically with her hands into the air. "oh, if i could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many!" "you know how the matter stands?" "porky shinwell has been telling me. he's after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. you want to stop it. well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him." "she is not in her senses. she is madly in love. she has been told all about him. she cares nothing." "told about the murder?" "yes." "my lord, she must have a nerve!" "she puts them all down as slanders." "couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes?" "well, can you help us do so?" "ain't i a proof myself? if i stood before her and told her how he used me----" "would you do this?" "would i? would i not!" "well, it might be worth trying. but he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and i understand she will not reopen the question." "i'll lay he didn't tell her all," said miss winter. "i caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. he would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: 'he died within a month.' it wasn't hot air, either. but i took little notice--you see, i loved him myself at that time. whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! there was just one thing that shook me. yes, by gripes! if it had not been for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes, i'd have left him that very night. it's a book he has--a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. i think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me." "what was it, then?" "i tell you, mr. holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. he had it all in that book. snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. it was a beastly book--a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. but it was adelbert gruner's book all the same. 'souls i have ruined.' he could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. however, that's neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can't get it." "where is it?" "how can i tell you where it is now? it's more than a year since i left him. i know where he kept it then. he's a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. do you know his house?" "i've been in the study," said holmes. "have you, though? you haven't been slow on the job if you only started this morning. maybe dear adelbert has met his match this time. the outer study is the one with the chinese crockery in it--big glass cupboard between the windows. then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study--a small room where he keeps papers and things." "is he not afraid of burglars?" "adelbert is no coward. his worst enemy couldn't say that of him. he can look after himself. there's a burglar alarm at night. besides, what is there for a burglar--unless they got away with all this fancy crockery?" "no good," said shinwell johnson, with the decided voice of the expert. "no fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell." "quite so," said holmes. "well, now, miss winter, if you would call here to-morrow evening at five, i would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. i am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation. i need not say that my clients will consider liberally----" "none of that, mr. holmes," cried the young woman. "i am not out for money. let me see this man in the mud, and i've got all i worked for--in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. that's my price. i'm with you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. porky here can tell you always where to find me." i did not see holmes again until the following evening, when we dined once more at our strand restaurant. he shrugged his shoulders when i asked him what luck he had had in his interview. then he told the story, which i would repeat in this way. his hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life. "there was no difficulty at all about the appointment," said holmes, "for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. the general 'phoned that all was ready, and the fiery miss w. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 berkeley square, where the old soldier resides--one of those awful grey london castles which would make a church seem frivolous. a footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain. "i don't quite know how to make her clear to you, watson. perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. she is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. i have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the middle ages. how a beast-man could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond i cannot imagine. you may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. you never saw a worse case than this. "she knew what we had come for, of course--that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. miss winter's advent rather amazed her, i think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. if your head is inclined to swell, my dear watson, take a course of miss violet de merville. "'well, sir,' said she, in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, 'your name is familiar to me. you have called, as i understand, to malign my fiancé, baron gruner. it is only by my father's request that i see you at all, and i warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.' "i was sorry for her, watson. i thought of her for the moment as i would have thought of a daughter of my own. i am not often eloquent. i use my head, not my heart. but i really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that i could find in my nature. i pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character after she is his wife--a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. i spared her nothing--the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. all my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. i thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. one could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies. "'i have listened to you with patience, mr. holmes,' said she. 'the effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. i am aware that adelbert, that my fiancé, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. you are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. possibly you mean well, though i learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the baron as against him. but in any case i wish you to understand once for all that i love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. if his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that i have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. i am not clear,' here she turned her eyes upon my companion, 'who this young lady may be.' "i was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. if ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women. "'i'll tell you who i am,' she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion--'i am his last mistress. i am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. _your_ refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that's the best. i tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he'll be the death of you. it may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he'll have you one way or the other. it's not out of love for you i'm speaking. i don't care a tinker's curse whether you live or die. it's out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. but it's all the same, and you needn't look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than i am before you are through with it.' "'i should prefer not to discuss such matters,' said miss de merville coldly. 'let me say once for all that i am aware of three passages in my fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that i am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done.' "'three passages!' screamed my companion. 'you fool! you unutterable fool!' "'mr. holmes, i beg that you will bring this interview to an end,' said the icy voice. 'i have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you, but i am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.' "with an oath miss winter darted forward, and if i had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. i dragged her towards the door, and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. in a cold way i felt pretty furious myself, watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. so now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that i must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won't work. i'll keep in touch with you, watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us." and it did. their blow fell--or his blow rather, for never could i believe that the lady was privy to it. i think i could show you the very paving-stone upon which i stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. it was between the "grand hotel" and charing cross station, where a one-legged news-vendor displayed his evening papers. the date was just two days after the last conversation. there, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet: +-------------+ | murderous | | attack | | upon | | sherlock | | holmes. | +-------------+ i think i stood stunned for some moments. then i have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom i had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist's shop while i turned up the fateful paragraph. this was how it ran: "we learn with regret that mr. sherlock holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. there are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in regent street, outside the café royal. the attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and mr. holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. he was carried to charing cross hospital, and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in baker street. the miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the café royal and out into glasshouse street behind it. no doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man." i need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before i had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to baker street. i found sir leslie oakshott, the famous surgeon in the hall and his brougham waiting at the kerb. "no immediate danger," was his report. "two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. several stitches have been necessary. morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden." with this permission i stole into the darkened room. the sufferer was wide awake, and i heard my name in a hoarse whisper. the blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. a crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. i sat beside him and bent my head. "all right, watson. don't look so scared," he muttered in a very weak voice. "it's not as bad as it seems." "thank god for that!" "i'm a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. i took most of them on my guard. it was the second man that was too much for me." "what can i do, holmes? of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. i'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word." "good old watson! no, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. but their get-away had been well prepared. we may be sure of that. wait a little. i have my plans. the first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. they'll come to you for news. put it on thick, watson. lucky if i live the week out--concussion--delirium--what you like! you can't overdo it." "but sir leslie oakshott?" "oh, he's all right. he shall see the worst side of me. i'll look after that." "anything else?" "yes. tell shinwell johnson to get that girl out of the way. those beauties will be after her now. they know, of course, that she was with me in the case. if they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. that is urgent. do it to-night." "i'll go now. anything more?" "put my pipe on the table--and the tobacco-slipper. right! come in each morning and we will plan our campaign." i arranged with johnson that evening to take miss winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past. for six days the public were under the impression that holmes was at the door of death. the bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. my continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. his wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. he was recovering fast, and i had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended, even to me. there was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be. he pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. i was nearer him than anyone else, and yet i was always conscious of the gap between. on the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. the same evening papers had an announcement which i was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. it was simply that among the passengers on the cunard boat _ruritania_, starting from liverpool on friday, was the baron adelbert gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the states before his impending wedding to miss violet de merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard. "friday!" he cried. "only three clear days. i believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger's way. but he won't, watson! by the lord harry, he won't! now, watson, i want you to do something for me." "i am here to be used, holmes." "well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of chinese pottery." he gave no explanations and i asked for none. by long experience i had learned the wisdom of obedience. but when i had left his room i walked down baker street, revolving in my head how on earth i was to carry out so strange an order. finally i drove to the london library in st. james's square, put the matter to my friend lomax, the sub-librarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm. it is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the saturday. certainly i should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. and yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning i was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. there i learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the hung-wu and the beauties of the yung-lo, the writings of tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the sung and the yuan. i was charged with all this information when i called upon holmes next evening. he was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite arm-chair. "why, holmes," i said, "if one believed the papers you are dying." "that," said he, "is the very impression which i intended to convey. and now, watson, have you learned your lessons?" "at least i have tried to." "good. you could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?" "i believe i could." "then hand me that little box from the mantel-piece." he opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine eastern silk. this he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour. "it needs careful handling, watson. this is the real egg-shell pottery of the ming dynasty. no finer piece ever passed through christie's. a complete set of this would be worth a king's ransom--in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of peking. the sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild." "what am i to do with it?" holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: "dr. hill barton, 369 half moon street." "that is your name for the evening, watson. you will call upon baron gruner. i know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. a note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of ming china. you may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. you are a collector, this set has come your way, you have heard of the baron's interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price." "what price?" "well asked, watson. you would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. this saucer was got for me by sir james, and comes, i understand, from the collection of his client. you will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world." "i could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert." "excellent, watson! you scintillate to-day. suggest christie or sotheby. your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself." "but if he won't see me?" "oh, yes, he will see you. he has the collection mania in its most acute form--and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. sit down, watson, and i will dictate the letter. no answer needed. you will merely say that you are coming, and why." it was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. a district messenger was duly dispatched with it. on the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of dr. hill barton in my pocket, i set off on my own adventure. the beautiful house and grounds indicated that baron gruner was, as sir james had said, a man of considerable wealth. a long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. the place had been built by a south african gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. a butler who would have adorned a bench of bishops showed me in, and handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ushered me into the baron's presence. he was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows, and which contained part of his chinese collection. he turned as i entered with a small brown vase in his hand. "pray sit down, doctor," said he. "i was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether i could really afford to add to them. this little tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. i am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. have you the ming saucer with you of which you spoke?" i carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. he seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. as he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and i was able to study them at my ease. he was certainly a remarkably handsome man. his european reputation for beauty was fully deserved. in figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. his face was swarthy, almost oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. his hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. his features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. if ever i saw a murderer's mouth it was there--a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. he was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was nature's danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. his voice was engaging and his manners perfect. in age i should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two. "very fine--very fine indeed!" he said at last. "and you say you have a set of six to correspond. what puzzles me is that i should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. i only know of one in england to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. would it be indiscreet if i were to ask you, dr. hill barton, how you obtained this?" "does it really matter?" i asked, with as careless an air as i could muster. "you can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, i am content to take an expert's valuation." "very mysterious," said he, with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark eyes. "in dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. that the piece is genuine is certain. i have no doubts at all about that. but suppose--i am bound to take every possibility into account--that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell?" "i would guarantee you against any claim of the sort." "that, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth." "my bankers would answer that." "quite so. and yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual." "you can do business or not," said i, with indifference. "i have given you the first offer as i understood that you were a connoisseur, but i shall have no difficulty in other quarters." "who told you i was a connoisseur?" "i was aware that you had written a book upon the subject." "have you read the book?" "no." "dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! you are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. how do you explain that?" "i am a very busy man. i am a doctor in practice." "that is no answer. if a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. you said in your note that you were a connoisseur." "so i am." "might i ask you a few questions to test you? i am obliged to tell you, doctor--if you are indeed a doctor--that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. i would ask you what do you know of the emperor shomu and how do you associate him with the shoso-in near nara? dear me, does that puzzle you? tell me a little about the northern wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics." i sprang from my chair in simulated anger. "this is intolerable, sir," said i. "i came here to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if i were a schoolboy. my knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but i certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way." he looked at me steadily. the languor had gone from his eyes. they suddenly glared. there was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips. "what is the game? you are here as a spy. you are an emissary of holmes. this is a trick that you are playing upon me. the fellow is dying, i hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. you've made your way in here without leave, and, by god! you may find it harder to get out than to get in." he had sprung to his feet, and i stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. he may have suspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth; but it was clear that i could not hope to deceive him. he dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently. "ah!" he cried. "ah!" and dashed into the room behind him. two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. the window leading out to the garden was wide open. beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood sherlock holmes. the next instant he was through the gap, and i heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. with a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window. and then! it was done in an instant, and yet i clearly saw it. an arm--a woman's arm--shot out from among the leaves. at the same instant the baron uttered a horrible cry--a yell which will always ring in my memory. he clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house. "water! for god's sake, water!" was his cry. i seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. at the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. i remember that one of them fainted as i knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. the vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. one eye was already white and glazed. the other was red and inflamed. the features which i had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. they were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible. in a few words i explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. "it was that hell-cat, kitty winter!" he cried. "oh, the she-devil! she shall pay for it! she shall pay! oh, god in heaven, this pain is more than i can bear!" i bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. all suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if i might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me. i could have wept over the ruin had i not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. it was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and i was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. an inspector of police had also arrived, and to him i handed my real card. it would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for i was nearly as well known by sight at the yard as holmes himself. then i left that house of gloom and terror. within an hour i was at baker street. holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the baron's transformation. "the wages of sin, watson--the wages of sin!" said he. "sooner or later it will always come. god knows, there was sin enough," he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. "here is the book the woman talked of. if this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. but it will, watson. it must. no self-respecting woman could stand it." "it is his love diary?" "or his lust diary. call it what you will. the moment the woman told us of it i realized what a tremendous weapon was there, if we could but lay our hands on it. i said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. but i brooded over it. then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. that was all to the good. i would have waited a little longer, but his visit to america forced my hand. he would never have left so compromising a document behind him. therefore we had to act at once. burglary at night is impossible. he takes precautions. but there was a chance in the evening if i could only be sure that his attention was engaged. that was where you and your blue saucer came in. but i had to be sure of the position of the book, and i knew i had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of chinese pottery. therefore i gathered the girl up at the last moment. how could i guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? i thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own." "he guessed i came from you." "i feared he would. but you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape. ah, sir james, i am very glad you have come!" our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. he listened with the deepest attention to holmes's account of what had occurred. "you have done wonders--wonders!" he cried, when he had heard the narrative. "but if these injuries are as terrible as dr. watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book." holmes shook his head. "women of the de merville type do not act like that. she would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. no, no. it is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. that book will bring her back to earth--and i know nothing else that could. it is in his own writing. she cannot get past it." sir james carried away both it and the precious saucer. as i was myself overdue, i went down with him into the street. a brougham was waiting for him. he sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, and drove swiftly away. he flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but i had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. i gasped with surprise. then i turned back and ascended the stair to holmes's room. "i have found out who our client is," i cried, bursting with my great news. "why, holmes, it is----" "it is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman," said holmes, holding up a restraining hand. "let that now and for ever be enough for us." i do not know how the incriminating book was used. sir james may have managed it. or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady's father. the effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired. three days later appeared a paragraph in _the morning post_ to say that the marriage between baron adelbert gruner and miss violet de merville would not take place. the same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against miss kitty winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered, was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. sherlock holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid british law becomes human and elastic. my friend has not yet stood in the dock. ii the adventure of the blanched soldier the ideas of my friend watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. for a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. perhaps i have rather invited this persecution, since i have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. "try it yourself, holmes!" he has retorted, and i am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, i do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. the following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that watson had no note of it in his collection. speaking of my old friend and biographer, i would take this opportunity to remark that if i burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own, to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. a confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is, indeed, an ideal helpmate. i find from my notebook that it was in january, 1903, just after the conclusion of the boer war, that i had my visit from mr. james m. dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding briton. the good watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which i can recall in our association. i was alone. it is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. mr. james m. dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. i did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. i have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so i gave him some of my conclusions. "from south africa, sir, i perceive." "yes, sir," he answered, with some surprise. "imperial yeomanry, i fancy." "exactly." "middlesex corps, no doubt." "that is so. mr. holmes, you are a wizard." i smiled at his bewildered expression. "when a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an english sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. you wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. you have the cut of a riding-man. as to middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from throgmorton street. what other regiment would you join?" "you see everything." "i see no more than you, but i have trained myself to notice what i see. however, mr. dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. what has been happening at tuxbury old park?" "mr. holmes----!" "my dear sir, there is no mystery. your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred." "yes, indeed. but the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. if colonel emsworth had not kicked me out----" "kicked you out!" "well, that was what it amounted to. he is a hard nail, is colonel emsworth. the greatest martinet in the army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. i couldn't have stuck the colonel if it had not been for godfrey's sake." i lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair. "perhaps you will explain what you are talking about." my client grinned mischievously. "i had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told," said he. "but i will give you the facts, and i hope to god that you will be able to tell me what they mean. i've been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more i think the more incredible does it become. "when i joined up in january, 1901--just two years ago--young godfrey emsworth had joined the same squadron. he was colonel emsworth's only son--emsworth, the crimean v.c.--and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. there was not a finer lad in the regiment. we formed a friendship--the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. he was my mate--and that means a good deal in the army. we took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near diamond hill outside pretoria. i got one letter from the hospital at cape town and one from southampton. since then not a word--not one word, mr. holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal. "well, when the war was over, and we all got back, i wrote to his father and asked where godfrey was. no answer. i waited a bit and then i wrote again. this time i had a reply, short and gruff. godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. that was all. "i wasn't satisfied, mr. holmes. the whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. he was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that. it was not like him. then, again, i happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. the old man was sometimes a bully, and young godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. no, i wasn't satisfied, and i determined that i would get to the root of the matter. it happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that i have been able to take up godfrey's case again. but since i have taken it up i mean to drop everything in order to see it through." mr. james m. dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. his blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke. "well, what have you done?" i asked. "my first move was to get down to his home, tuxbury old park, near bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. i wrote to the mother, therefore--i had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father--and i made a clean frontal attack: godfrey was my chum, i had a great deal of interest which i might tell her of our common experiences, i should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? in reply i had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. that was what took me down on monday. "tuxbury old hall is inaccessible--five miles from anywhere. there was no trap at the station, so i had to walk, carrying my suit-case, and it was nearly dark before i arrived. it is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. i should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered elizabethan foundation and ending in a victorian portico. inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. there was a butler, old ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house and there was his wife, who might have been older. she had been godfrey's nurse, and i had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so i was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. the mother i liked also--a gentle little white mouse of a woman. it was only the colonel himself whom i barred. "we had a bit of a barney right away, and i should have walked back to the station if i had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. i was shown straight into his study, and there i found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard, seated behind his littered desk. a red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. i could understand now why godfrey seldom spoke of his father. "'well, sir,' said he in a rasping voice. 'i should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.' "i answered that i had explained them in my letter to his wife. "'yes, yes; you said that you had known godfrey in africa. we have, of course, only your word for that.' "'i have his letters to me in my pocket.' "'kindly let me see them.' "he glanced at the two which i handed him, and then he tossed them back. "'well, what then?' he asked. "'i was fond of your son godfrey, sir. many ties and memories united us. is it not natural that i should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?' "'i have some recollection, sir, that i had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. he has gone upon a voyage round the world. his health was in a poor way after his african experiences, and both his mother and i were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.' "'certainly,' i answered. 'but perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. i have no doubt that i should be able to get a letter through to him.' "my request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. his great eyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. he looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it. "'many people, mr. dodd,' said he, 'would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.' "'you must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.' "'exactly. i have already made every allowance upon that score. i must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. my wife is anxious to hear something of godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her, but i would ask you to let the present and the future alone. such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.' "so i came to a dead end, mr. holmes. there was no getting past it. i could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that i would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up. it was a dull evening. we dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. the lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. i was so bored by the whole proceeding that i made an excuse as soon as i decently could and retired to my bedroom. it was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, mr. holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters. i opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. then i sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. i was interrupted, however, by ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals. "'i thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. it is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.' "he hesitated before leaving the room, and when i looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face. "'beg your pardon, sir, but i could not help hearing what you said of young master godfrey at dinner. you know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so i may say i am his foster-father. it's natural we should take an interest. and you say he carried himself well, sir?' "'there was no braver man in the regiment. he pulled me out once from under the rifles of the boers, or maybe i should not be here.' "the old butler rubbed his skinny hands. "'yes, sir, yes, that is master godfrey all over. he was always courageous. there's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. nothing would stop him. he was a fine boy--and oh, sir, he was a fine man.' "i sprang to my feet. "'look here!' i cried. 'you say he was. you speak as if he were dead. what is all this mystery? what has become of godfrey emsworth?' "i gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away. "'i don't know what you mean, sir. ask the master about master godfrey. he knows. it is not for me to interfere.' "he was leaving the room, but i held his arm. "'listen,' i said. 'you are going to answer one question before you leave if i have to hold you all night. is godfrey dead?' "he could not face my eyes. he was like a man hypnotized. the answer was dragged from his lips. it was a terrible and unexpected one. "'i wish to god he was!' he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room. "you will think, mr. holmes, that i returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. the old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal, or, at the least, disreputable, transaction which touched the family honour. that stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. godfrey was a reckless fellow. he was easily influenced by those around him. no doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. it was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if i could aid him. i was anxiously pondering the matter when i looked up, and there was godfrey emsworth standing before me." my client had paused as one in deep emotion. "pray continue," i said. "your problem presents some very unusual features." "he was outside the window, mr. holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. i have told you that i looked out at the night. when i did so, i left the curtains partly open. his figure was framed in this gap. the window came down to the ground and i could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. he was deadly pale--never have i seen a man so white. i reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. he sprang back when he saw that i was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness. "there was something shocking about the man, mr. holmes. it wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. it was more subtle than that--something slinking, something furtive, something guilty--something very unlike the frank, manly lad that i had known. it left a feeling of horror in my mind. "but when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. godfrey had hardly vanished before i was at the window. there was an awkward catch, and i was some little time before i could throw it up. then i nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that i thought he might have taken. "it was a long path and the light was not very good but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. i ran on and called his name, but it was no use. when i got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. i stood hesitating, and as i did so i heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. it was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. that was enough, mr. holmes, to assure me that what i had seen was not a vision. godfrey had run away from me and he had shut a door behind him. of that i was certain. "there was nothing more i could do, and i spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. next day i found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. a somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. i was already perfectly convinced that godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved. "the house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. if the secret lay there, it was difficult for me to penetrate it. but the door which i had heard close was certainly not in the house. i must explore the garden and see what i could find. there was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices. "there were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size--large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence. could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? i approached it in a careless fashion, as though i were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. as i did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat--not at all the gardener type--came out of the door. to my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. then he looked at me with some surprise on his face. "'are you a visitor here?' he asked. "i explained that i was and that i was a friend of godfrey's. "'what a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,' i continued. "'quite so. exactly,' said he, with a rather guilty air. 'no doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.' he passed on, but when i turned i observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden. "i had a good look at the little house as i passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. i might spoil my own game, and even be ordered off the premises, if i were too audacious, for i was still conscious that i was being watched. therefore, i strolled back to the house and waited for night before i went on with my inquiry. when all was dark and quiet, i slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge. "i have said that it was heavily curtained, but now i found that the windows were shuttered as well. some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so i concentrated my attention upon this. i was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter so that i could see the inside of the room. it was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. opposite to me was seated the little man whom i had seen in the morning. he was smoking a pipe and reading a paper." "what paper?" i asked. my client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative. "can it matter?" he asked. "it is most essential." "i really took no notice." "possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies." "now that you mention it, it was not large. it might have been _the spectator_. however, i had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and i could swear that this second man was godfrey. i could not see his face, but i knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. he was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. i was hesitating as to what i should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was colonel emsworth beside me. "'this way, sir!' said he in a low voice. he walked in silence to the house and i followed him into my own bedroom. he had picked up a timetable in the hall. "'there is a train to london at eight-thirty,' said he. 'the trap will be at the door at eight.' "he was white with rage, and, indeed, i felt myself in so difficult a position that i could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies, in which i tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend. "'the matter will not bear discussion,' said he abruptly. 'you have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. you were here as a guest and you have become a spy. i have nothing more to say, sir, save that i have no wish ever to see you again.' "at this i lost my temper, mr. holmes, and i spoke with some warmth. "'i have seen your son, and i am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. i have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but i am sure that he is no longer a free agent. i warn you, colonel emsworth, that until i am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend i shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and i shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.' "the old fellow looked diabolical, and i really thought he was about to attack me. i have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though i am no weakling i might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. however, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. for my part, i took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which i had already written." such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. it presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. i now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions. "the servants," i asked; "how many were in the house?" "to the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. they seemed to live in the simplest fashion." "there was no servant, then, in the detached house?" "none, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. he seemed, however, to be quite a superior person." "that seems very suggestive. had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?" "now that you mention it, i did see old ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. the idea of food did not occur to me at the moment." "did you make any local inquiries?" "yes, i did. i spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. i simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, godfrey emsworth. both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. he had come home and then had almost at once started off again. the story was evidently universally accepted." "you said nothing of your suspicions?" "nothing." "that was very wise. the matter should certainly be inquired into. i will go back with you to tuxbury old park." "to-day?" it happened that at the moment i was clearing up the case which my friend watson has described as that of the abbey school, in which the duke of greyminster was so deeply involved. i had also a commission from the sultan of turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that i was able to start forth on my mission to bedfordshire in company with mr. james m. dodd. as we drove to euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with whom i had made the necessary arrangements. "this is an old friend," said i to dodd. "it is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. it is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter." the narratives of watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that i do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said and the three of us continued our journey together. in the train i asked dodd one more question which i wished our companion to hear. "you say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?" "i have no doubt about it whatever. his nose was pressed against the glass. the lamplight shone full upon him." "it could not have been someone resembling him?" "no, no; it was he." "but you say he was changed?" "only in colour. his face was--how shall i describe it?--it was of a fish-belly whiteness. it was bleached." "was it equally pale all over?" "i think not. it was his brow which i saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window." "did you call to him?" "i was too startled and horrified for the moment. then i pursued him, as i have told you, but without result." my case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. when, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. i had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. he wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. i have, as my friend watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. it seemed to centre on the hall-table. i turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. i passed on into the study with my case complete. alas, that i should have to show my hand so when i tell my own story! it was by concealing such links in the chain that watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales. colonel emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of ralph's message. we heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. the door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever i have seen. he held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments. "have i not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? never dare to show your damned face here again. if you enter again without my leave i shall be within my rights if i use violence. i'll shoot you, sir! by god, i will! as to you, sir," turning upon me, "i extend the same warning to you. i am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. there is no opening for them here." "i cannot leave here," said my client firmly, "until i hear from godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint." our involuntary host rang the bell. "ralph," he said, "telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. tell him there are burglars in the house." "one moment," said i. "you must be aware, mr. dodd, that colonel emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. on the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. i venture to hope that, if i were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with colonel emsworth, i could certainly alter his view of the matter." "i am not so easily altered," said the old soldier. "ralph, do what i have told you. what the devil are you waiting for? ring up the police!" "nothing of the sort," i said, putting my back to the door. "any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread." i took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. "that," said i, as i handed it to colonel emsworth, "is what has brought us here." he stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished. "how do you know?" he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair. "it is my business to know things. that is my trade." he sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. then he made a gesture of resignation. "well, if you wish to see godfrey, you shall. it is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. ralph, tell mr. godfrey and mr. kent that in five minutes we shall be with them." at the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. a small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face. "this is very sudden, colonel emsworth," said he. "this will disarrange all our plans." "i can't help it, mr. kent. our hands have been forced. can mr. godfrey see us?" "yes; he is waiting inside." he turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. a man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand. "why, godfrey, old man, this is fine!" but the other waved him back. "don't touch me, jimmie. keep your distance. yes, you may well stare! i don't quite look the smart lance-corporal emsworth, of b squadron, do i?" his appearance was certainly extraordinary. one could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an african sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin. "that's why i don't court visitors," said he. "i don't mind you, jimmie, but i could have done without your friend. i suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage." "i wanted to be sure that all was well with you, godfrey. i saw you that night when you looked into my window, and i could not let the matter rest till i had cleared things up." "old ralph told me you were there, and i couldn't help taking a peep at you. i hoped you would not have seen me, and i had to run to my burrow when i heard the window go up." "but what in heaven's name is the matter?" "well, it's not a long story to tell," said he, lighting a cigarette. "you remember that morning fight at buffelsspruit, outside pretoria, on the eastern railway line? you heard i was hit?" "yes, i heard that, but i never got particulars." "three of us got separated from the others. it was very broken country, you may remember. there was simpson--the fellow we called baldy simpson--and anderson, and i. we were clearing brother boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. the other two were killed. i got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. i stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before i fainted and rolled off the saddle. "when i came to myself it was nightfall, and i raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. to my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. it was deadly cold. you remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. well, i was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. i staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what i did. i have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. it was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. i drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment i was in a deep sleep. "it was morning when i wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity i had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. the african sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. in front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as i looked at them. not one of them was a normal human being. every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. the laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear. "it seemed that none of them could speak english, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry and, uttering wild beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. the little monster was as strong as a bull, and i don't know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub. he said a few stern words in dutch and my persecutor shrank away. then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement. "'how in the world did you come here?' he asked, in amazement. 'wait a bit! i see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. i am a doctor, and i'll soon have you tied up. but, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. you are in the leper hospital, and you have slept in a leper's bed.' "need i tell you more, jimmie? it seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. then, as the british advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what i had done. he put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so i was removed to the general hospital at pretoria. "so there you have my tragedy. i hoped against hope, but it was not until i had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that i had not escaped. what was i to do? i was in this lonely house. we had two servants whom we could utterly trust. there was a house where i could live. under pledge of secrecy, mr. kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. it seemed simple enough on those lines. the alternative was a dreadful one--segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. but absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an outcry, and i should have been dragged to my horrible doom. even you, jimmie--even you had to be kept in the dark. why my father has relented i cannot imagine." colonel emsworth pointed to me. "this is the gentleman who forced my hand." he unfolded the scrap of paper on which i had written the word "leprosy." "it seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all." "and so it was," said i. "who knows but good may come of it? i understand that only mr. kent has seen the patient. may i ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, i understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?" "i have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man," he observed, with some stiffness. "i have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but i am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. you have avoided this, i understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient." "that is so," said colonel emsworth. "i foresaw this situation," i explained, "and i have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. i was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. his name is sir james saunders." the prospect of an interview with lord roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of mr. kent. "i shall indeed be proud," he murmured. "then i will ask sir james to step this way. he is at present in the carriage outside the door. meanwhile, colonel emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where i could give the necessary explanations." and here it is that i miss my watson. by cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematized common sense, into a prodigy. when i tell my own story i have no such aid. and yet i will give my process of thought even as i gave it to my small audience, which included godfrey's mother, in the study of colonel emsworth. "that process," said i, "starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains however improbable, must be the truth. it may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. we will now apply this principle to the case in point. as it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion. there was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. i could think of no other adequate solutions. these, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other. "the criminal solution would not bear inspection. no unsolved crime had been reported from that district. i was sure of that. if it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. i could see no explanation for such a line of conduct. "insanity was more plausible. the presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. the fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. on the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. you will remember, mr. dodd, that i felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which mr. kent was reading. had it been _the lancet_ or _the british medical journal_ it would have helped me. it is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? once again i could not get the theory to fit the facts. "there remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. leprosy is not uncommon in south africa. by some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. his people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. a devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. there would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. the case was a strong one--so strong that i determined to act as if it were actually proved. when on arriving here i noticed that ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. a single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if i wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted." i was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. but for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. he strode up to colonel emsworth and shook him by the hand. "it is often my lot to bring ill-tidings, and seldom good," said he. "this occasion is the more welcome. it is not leprosy." "what?" "a well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly non-infective. yes, mr. holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. but is it coincidence? are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? are we assured that the apprehension, from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion, may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? at any rate, i pledge my professional reputation---- but the lady has fainted! i think that mr. kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock." iii the adventure of the mazarin stone it was pleasant to dr. watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in baker street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. he looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective. "it all seems very unchanged, billy. you don't change, either. i hope the same can be said of him?" billy glanced, with some solicitude, at the closed door of the bedroom. "i think he's in bed and asleep," he said. it was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but dr. watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea. "that means a case, i suppose?" "yes, sir; he is very hard at it just now. i'm frightened for his health. he gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'when will you be pleased to dine, mr. holmes?' mrs. hudson asked. 'seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. you know his way when he is keen on a case." "yes, billy, i know." "he's following someone. yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. to-day he was an old woman. fairly took me in, he did, and i ought to know his ways by now." billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. "that's part of the old woman's outfit," he said. "but what is it all about, billy?" billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of state. "i don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. it's this case of the crown diamond." "what--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?" "yes, sir. they must get it back, sir. why, we had the prime minister and the home secretary both sitting on that very sofa. mr. holmes was very nice to them. he soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. then there is lord cantlemere----" "ah!" "yes, sir; you know what that means. he's a stiff 'un, sir, if i may say so. i can get along with the prime minister, and i've nothing against the home secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but i can't stand his lordship. neither can mr. holmes, sir. you see, he don't believe in mr. holmes and he was against employing him. he'd rather he failed." "and mr. holmes knows it?" "mr. holmes always knows whatever there is to know." "well, we'll hope he won't fail and that lord cantlemere will be confounded. but i say, billy, what is that curtain for across the window?" "mr. holmes had it put up there three days ago. we've got something funny behind it." billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window. dr. watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. there was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downwards, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair. billy detached the head and held it in the air. "we put it at different angles, so that it may seem more life-like. i wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. but when it's up you can see this from across the way." "we used something of the sort once before." "before my time," said billy. he drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. "there are folk who watch us from over yonder. i can see a fellow now at the window. have a look for yourself." watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. with a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more. "that will do, billy," said he. "you were in danger of your life then, my boy, and i can't do without you just yet. well, watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. you come at a critical moment." "so i gather." "you can go, billy. that boy is a problem, watson. how far am i justified in allowing him to be in danger?" "danger of what, holmes?" "of sudden death. i'm expecting something this evening." "expecting what?" "to be murdered, watson." "no, no; you are joking, holmes!" "even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. but we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? is alcohol permitted? the gasogene and cigars are in the old place. let me see you once more in the customary arm-chair. you have not, i hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? it has to take the place of food these days." "but why not eat?" "because the faculties become refined when you starve them. why, surely, as a doctor, my dear watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. i am a brain, watson. the rest of me is a mere appendix. therefore, it is the brain i must consider." "but this danger, holmes?" "ah, yes; in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. you can give it to scotland yard, with my love and a parting blessing. sylvius is the name--count negretto sylvius. write it down, man, write it down! 136 moorside gardens, n.w. got it?" watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. he knew only too well the immense risks taken by holmes, and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion. "count me in, holmes. i have nothing to do for a day or two." "your morals don't improve, watson. you have added fibbing to your other vices. you bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour." "not such important ones. but can't you have this fellow arrested?" "yes, watson, i could. that's what worries him so." "but why don't you?" "because i don't know where the diamond is." "ah! billy told me--the missing crown jewel!" "yes, the great yellow mazarin stone. i've cast my net and i have my fish. but i have not got the stone. what is the use of taking _them_? we can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. but that is not what i am out for. it's the stone i want." "and is this count sylvius one of your fish?" "yes, and he's a shark. he bites. the other is sam merton, the boxer. not a bad fellow, sam, but the count has used him. sam's not a shark. he is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. but he is flopping about in my net all the same." "where is this count sylvius?" "i've been at his very elbow all the morning. you've seen me as an old lady, watson. i was never more convincing. he actually picked up my parasol for me once. 'by your leave, madame,' said he--half-italian, you know, and with the southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. life is full of whimsical happenings, watson." "it might have been tragedy." "well, perhaps it might. i followed him to old straubenzee's workshop in the minories. straubenzee made the air-gun--a very pretty bit of work, as i understand, and i rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. have you seen the dummy? of course, billy showed it to you. well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. ah, billy, what is it?" the boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile. "the man himself. i had hardly expected this. grasp the nettle, watson! a man of nerve. possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. it would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. this is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel." "send for the police." "i probably shall. but not just yet. would you glance carefully out of the window, watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?" watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain. "yes, there is one rough fellow near the door." "that will be sam merton--the faithful but rather fatuous sam. where is this gentleman, billy?" "in the waiting-room, sir." "show him up when i ring." "yes, sir." "if i am not in the room, show him in all the same." "yes, sir." watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion. "look here, holmes, this is simply impossible. this is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. he may have come to murder you." "i should not be surprised." "i insist upon staying with you." "you would be horribly in the way." "in his way?" "no, my dear fellow--in my way." "well, i can't possibly leave you." "yes, you can, watson. and you will, for you have never failed to play the game. i am sure you will play it to the end. this man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine." holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. "take a cab to scotland yard and give this to youghal of the c.i.d. come back with the police. the fellow's arrest will follow." "i'll do that with joy." "before you return i may have just time enough to find out where the stone is." he touched the bell. "i think we will go out through the bedroom. this second exit is exceedingly useful. i rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and i have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it." it was, therefore, an empty room into which billy, a minute later, ushered count sylvius. the famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache, shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose, like the beak of an eagle. he was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. as the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair in the window. at first his expression was one of pure amazement. then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. he took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. he was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door: "don't break it, count! don't break it!" the assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. for an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side. "it's a pretty little thing," said holmes, advancing towards the image. "tavernier, the french modeller, made it. he is as good at waxworks as your friend straubenzee is at air-guns." "air-guns, sir! what do you mean?" "put your hat and stick on the side-table. thank you! pray take a seat. would you care to put your revolver out also? oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. your visit is really most opportune, for i wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you." the count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows. "i, too, wished to have some words with you, holmes. that is why i am here. i won't deny that i intended to assault you just now." holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table. "i rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head," said he. "but why these personal attentions?" "because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. because you have put your creatures upon my track." "my creatures! i assure you no!" "nonsense! i have had them followed. two can play at that game, holmes." "it is a small point, count sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. you can understand that, with my routine of work, i should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious." "well, _mr._ holmes, then." "excellent! but i assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents." count sylvius laughed contemptuously. "other people can observe as well as you. yesterday there was an old sporting man. to-day it was an elderly woman. they held me in view all day." "really, sir, you compliment me. old baron dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. and now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise!" "it was you--you yourself?" holmes shrugged his shoulders. "you can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the minories before you began to suspect." "if i had known, you might never----" "have seen this humble home again. i was well aware of it. we all have neglected opportunities to deplore. as it happens, you did not know, so here we are!" the count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. "what you say only makes the matter worse. it was not your agents, but your play-acting, busybody self! you admit that you have dogged me. why?" "come now, count. you used to shoot lions in algeria." "well?" "but why?" "why? the sport--the excitement--the danger!" "and, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?" "exactly!" "my reasons in a nutshell!" the count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket. "sit down, sir, sit down! there was another, more practical, reason. i want that yellow diamond!" count sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile. "upon my word!" said he. "you knew that i was after you for that. the real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much i know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. well, i should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for i know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me." "oh, indeed! and, pray, what is this missing fact?" "where the crown diamond now is." the count looked sharply at his companion. "oh, you want to know that, do you? how the devil should i be able to tell you where it is?" "you can, and you will." "indeed!" "you can't bluff me, count sylvius." holmes's eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. "you are absolute plate-glass. i see to the very back of your mind." "then, of course, you see where the diamond is!" holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. "then you do know. you have admitted it!" "i admit nothing." "now, count, if you will be reasonable, we can do business. if not, you will get hurt." count sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. "and you talk about bluff!" said he. holmes looked at him thoughtfully, like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook. "do you know what i keep in this book?" "no, sir, i do not!" "you!" "me?" "yes, sir, _you_! you are all here--every action of your vile and dangerous life." "damn you, holmes!" cried the count, with blazing eyes. "there are limits to my patience!" "it's all here, count. the real facts as to the death of old mrs. harold, who left you the blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away." "you are dreaming!" "and the complete life history of miss minnie warrender." "tut! you will make nothing of that!" "plenty more here, count. here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to the riviera on february 13, 1892. here is the forged cheque in the same year on the crédit lyonnais." "no; you're wrong there." "then i am right on the others! now, count, you are a card-player. when the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand." "what has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?" "gently, count. restrain that eager mind! let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. i have all this against you; but, above all, i have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the crown diamond. "indeed!" "i have the cabman who took you to whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. i have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. i have ikey sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. ikey has peached, and the game is up." the veins stood out on the count's forehead. his dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. he tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves. "that's the hand i play from," said holmes. "i put it all upon the table. but one card is missing. it's the king of diamonds. i don't know where the stone is." "you never shall know." "no? now, be reasonable, count. consider the situation. you are going to be locked up for twenty years. so is sam merton. what good are you going to get out of your diamond? none in the world. but if you hand it over--well, i'll compound a felony. we don't want you or sam. we want the stone. give that up, and so far as i am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. if you make another slip--well, it will be the last. but this time my commission is to get the stone, not you." "but if i refuse?" "why, then--alas!--it must be you and not the stone." billy had appeared in answer to a ring. "i think, count, that it would be as well to have your friend sam at this conference. after all, his interests should be represented. billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. ask him to come up." "if he won't come, sir?" "no violence, billy. don't be rough with him. if you tell him that count sylvius wants him he will certainly come." "what are you going to do now?" asked the count, as billy disappeared. "my friend watson was with me just now. i told him that i had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now i am drawing the net and up they come together." the count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown. "you won't die in your bed, holmes." "i have often had the same idea. does it matter very much? after all, count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. but these anticipations of the future are morbid. why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?" a sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready. "it is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend," he said, in a quiet voice. "you know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if i gave you time to draw it. nasty, noisy things, revolvers, count. better stick to air-guns. ah! i think i hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. good day, mr. merton. rather dull in the street, is it not?" the prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. he turned to his more astute comrade for help. "what's the game now, count? what's this fellow want? what's up?" his voice was deep and raucous. the count shrugged his shoulders and it was holmes who answered. "if i may put it in a nutshell, mr. merton, i should say it was _all_ up." the boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate. "is this cove trying to be funny, or what? i'm not in the funny mood myself." "no, i expect not," said holmes. "i think i can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. now, look here, count sylvius. i'm a busy man and i can't waste time. i'm going into that bedroom. pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. you can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. i shall try over the hoffmann barcarolle upon my violin. in five minutes i shall return for your final answer. you quite grasp the alternative, do you not? shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?" holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. a few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom. "what is it, then?" asked merton anxiously, as his companion turned to him. "does he know about the stone?" "he knows a damned sight too much about it. i'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it." "good lord!" the boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter. "ikey sanders has split on us." "he has, has he? i'll do him down a thick 'un for that if i swing for it." "that won't help us much. we've got to make up our minds what to do." "half a mo'," said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. "he's a leary cove that wants watching. i suppose he's not listening?" "how can he be listening with that music going?" "that's right. maybe somebody's behind a curtain. too many curtains in this room." as he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words. "tut! it's only a dummy," said the count. "a fake, is it? well, strike me! madame tussaud ain't in it. it's the living spit of him, gown and all. but them curtains, count!" "oh, confound the curtains! we are wasting our time, and there is none too much. he can lag us over this stone." "the deuce he can!" "but he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is." "what! give it up? give up a hundred thousand quid?" "it's one or the other." merton scratched his short-cropped pate. "he's alone in there. let's do him in. if his light were out we should have nothing to fear." the count shook his head. "he is armed and ready. if we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. besides, it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. hallo! what was that?" there was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. both men sprang round, but all was quiet. save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty. "something in the street," said merton. "now look here, guv'nor, you've got the brains. surely you can think a way out of it. if slugging is no use then it's up to you." "i've fooled better men than he," the count answered. "the stone is here in my secret pocket. i take no chances leaving it about. it can be out of england to-night and cut into four pieces in amsterdam before sunday. he knows nothing of van seddar." "i thought van seddar was going next week." "he _was_. but now he must get off by the next boat. one or other of us must slip round with the stone to lime street and tell him." "but the false bottom ain't ready." "well, he must take it as it is and chance it. there's not a moment to lose." again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come. "as to holmes," he continued, "we can fool him easily enough. you see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. well, we'll promise him the stone. we'll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in holland and we out of the country." "that sounds good to me!" cried sam merton, with a grin. "you go on and tell the dutchman to get a move on him. i'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. i'll tell him that the stone is in liverpool. confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! by the time he finds it isn't in liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. here is the stone." "i wonder you dare carry it." "where could i have it safer? if we could take it out of whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings." "let's have a look at it." count sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate, and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him. "what--d'ye think i'm going to snatch it off you? see here, mister, i'm getting a bit tired of your ways." "well, well; no offence, sam. we can't afford to quarrel. come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. now hold it to the light! here!" "thank you!" with a single spring holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel. he held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the count's head. the two villains staggered back in utter amazement. before they had recovered holmes had pressed the electric bell. "no violence, gentlemen--no violence, i beg of you! consider the furniture! it must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. the police are waiting below." the count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear. "but how the deuce----?" he gasped. "your surprise is very natural. you are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. i fancied that you must have heard me when i displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. it gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence." the count gave a gesture of resignation. "we give you best, holmes. i believe you are the devil himself." "not far from him, at any rate," holmes answered, with a polite smile. sam merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last. "a fair cop!" said he. "but, i say, what about that bloomin' fiddle! i hear it yet." "tut, tut!" holmes answered. "you are perfectly right. let it play! these modern gramophones are a remarkable invention." there was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. watson lingered with holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable billy with his card-tray. "lord cantlemere, sir." "show him up, billy. this is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests," said holmes. "he is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. shall we make him unbend? dare we venture upon a slight liberty? he knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred." the door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand. "how-do-you-do, lord cantlemere? it is chilly, for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. may i take your overcoat?" "no, i thank you; i will not take it off." holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve. "pray allow me! my friend dr. watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious." his lordship shook himself free with some impatience. "i am quite comfortable, sir. i have no need to stay. i have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing." "it is difficult--very difficult." "i feared that you would find it so." there was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner. "every man finds his limitations, mr. holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction." "yes, sir, i have been much perplexed." "no doubt." "especially upon one point. possibly you could help me upon it?" "you apply for my advice rather late in the day. i thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. still, i am ready to help you." "you see, lord cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves." "when you have caught them." "exactly. but the question is--how shall we proceed against the receiver?" "is this not rather premature?" "it is as well to have our plans ready. now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?" "the actual possession of the stone." "you would arrest him upon that?" "most undoubtedly." holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend watson could remember. "in that case, my dear sir, i shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest." lord cantlemere was very angry. some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks. "you take a great liberty, mr. holmes. in fifty years of official life i cannot recall such a case. i am a busy man, sir, engaged upon important affairs, and i have no time or taste for foolish jokes. i may tell you frankly, sir, that i have never been a believer in your powers, and that i have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. your conduct confirms all my conclusions. i have the honour, sir, to wish you good evening." holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door. "one moment, sir," said he. "to actually go off with the mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it." "sir, this is intolerable! let me pass." "put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat." "what do you mean, sir?" "come--come; do what i ask." an instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm. "what! what! how is this, mr. holmes?" "too bad, lord cantlemere, too bad!" cried holmes. "my old friend here will tell you that i have an impish habit of practical joking. also that i can never resist a dramatic situation. i took the liberty--the very great liberty, i admit--of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview." the old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him. "sir, i am bewildered. but--yes--it is indeed the mazarin stone. we are greatly your debtors, mr. holmes. your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least i withdraw any reflection i have made upon your amazing professional powers. but how----" "the case is but half finished; the details can wait. no doubt, lord cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. billy, you will show his lordship out, and tell mrs. hudson that i should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible." iv the adventure of the three gables i don't think that any of my adventures with mr. sherlock holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which i associate with the three gables. i had not seen holmes for some days, and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed. he was in a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. if i had said that a mad bull had arrived, it would give a clearer impression of what occurred. the door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room. he would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie. his broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other. "which of you genelmen is masser holmes?" he asked. holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile. "oh! it's you, is it?" said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. "see here, masser holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks' business. leave folks to manage their own affairs. got that, masser holmes?" "keep on talking," said holmes. "it's fine." "oh! it's fine, is it?" growled the savage. "it won't be so damn fine if i have to trim you up a bit. i've handled your kind before now, and they didn't look fine when i was through with them. look at that, masser holmes!" he swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose. holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest. "were you born so?" he asked. "or did it come by degrees?" it may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the slight clatter which i made as i picked up the poker. in any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant. "well, i've given you fair warnin'," said he. "i've a friend that's interested out harrow way--you know what i'm meaning--and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you. got that? you ain't the law, and i ain't the law either, and if you come in i'll be on hand also. don't you forget it." "i've wanted to meet you for some time," said holmes. "i won't ask you to sit down, for i don't like the smell of you, but aren't you steve dixie, the bruiser? "that's my name, masser holmes, and you'll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip." "it is certainly the last thing you need," said holmes, staring at our visitor's hideous mouth. "but it was the killing of young perkins outside the holborn bar---- what! you're not going?" the negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. "i won't listen to no such talk," said he. "what have i to do with this 'ere perkins, masser holmes? i was trainin' at the bull ring in birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble." "yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, steve," said holmes. "i've been watching you and barney stockdale----" "so help me the lord! masser holmes----" "that's enough. get out of it. i'll pick you up when i want you." "good mornin', masser holmes. i hope there ain't no hard feelin's about this 'ere visit?" "there will be unless you tell me who sent you." "why, there ain't no secret about that, masser holmes. it was that same genelman that you have just done gone mention." "and who set him on to it?" "s'elp me. i don't know, masser holmes. he just say, 'steve, you go see mr. holmes, and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down harrow way.' that's the whole truth." without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered. holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle. "i am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, watson. i observed your manoeuvres with the poker. but he is really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. he is one of the spencer john gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which i may clear up when i have time. his immediate principal, barney, is a more astute person. they specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. what i want to know is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion?" "but why do they want to intimidate you?" "it is this harrow weald case. it decides me to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble, there must be something in it." "but what is it?" "i was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude. here is mrs. maberley's note. if you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once." dear mr. sherlock holmes, (i read)-- i have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house, and i should much value your advice. you would find me at home any time to-morrow. the house is within a short walk of the weald station. i believe that my late husband, mortimer maberley, was one of your early clients. yours faithfully, mary maberley. the address was "the three gables, harrow weald." "so that's that!" said holmes. "and now, if you can spare the time, watson, we will get upon our way." a short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland. three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. behind was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing. none the less, we found the house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and culture. "i remember your husband well, madam," said holmes, "though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter." "probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son douglas." holmes looked at her with great interest. "dear me! are you the mother of douglas maberley? i knew him slightly. but, of course, all london knew him. what a magnificent creature he was! where is he now?" "dead, mr. holmes, dead! he was attaché at rome, and he died there of pneumonia last month." "i am sorry. one could not connect death with such a man. i have never known anyone so vitally alive. he lived intensely--every fibre of him!" "too intensely, mr. holmes. that was the ruin of him. you remember him as he was--debonair and splendid. you did not see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he developed. his heart was broken. in a single month i seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man." "a love affair--a woman?" "or a fiend. well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that i asked you to come, mr. holmes." "dr. watson and i are at your service." "there have been some very strange happenings. i have been in this house more than a year now, and as i wished to lead a retired life i have seen little of my neighbours. three days ago i had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. he said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if i would part with it money would be no object. it seemed to me very strange, as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally i was interested in what he said. i therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than i gave. he at once closed with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would i put a price upon it. some of this furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that i named a good round sum. to this also he at once agreed. i had always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that i should be my own mistress for the rest of my life. "yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out. luckily i showed it to mr. sutro, my lawyer, who lives in harrow. he said to me, 'this is a very strange document. are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take _anything_ out of the house--not even your own private possessions?' when the man came again in the evening i pointed this out, and i said that i meant only to sell the furniture. "'no, no; everything,' said he. "'but my clothes? my jewels?' "'well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects. but nothing shall go out of the house unchecked. my client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things. it is everything or nothing with him.' "'then it must be nothing,' said i. and there the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that i thought----" here we had a very extraordinary interruption. holmes raised his hand for silence. then he strode across the room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder. she entered with ungainly struggles, like some huge awkward chicken, torn squawking out of its coop. "leave me alone! what are you a-doin' of?" she screeched. "why, susan, what is this?" "well, ma'am, i was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me." "i have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. just a little wheezy, susan, are you not? you breathe too heavily for that kind of work." susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. "who be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this?" "it was merely that i wished to ask a question in your presence. did you, mrs. maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me?" "no, mr. holmes, i did not." "who posted your letter?" "susan did." "exactly. now, susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me?" "it's a lie. i sent no message." "now, susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know. it's a wicked thing to tell fibs. whom did you tell?" "susan!" cried her mistress, "i believe you are a bad, treacherous woman. i remember now that i saw you speaking to someone over the hedge." "that was my own business," said the woman sullenly. "suppose i tell you that it was barney stockdale to whom you spoke?" said holmes. "well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?" "i was not sure, but i know now. well now, susan, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of barney." "someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world." "so, a rich man? no; you smiled--a rich woman. now we have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner." "i'll see you in hell first." "oh, susan! language!" "i am clearing out of here. i've had enough of you all. i'll send for my box to-morrow." she flounced for the door. "good-bye, susan. paregoric is the stuff.... now," he continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, "this gang means business. look how close they play the game. your letter to me had the 10 p.m. postmark. and yet susan passes the word to barney. barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions; he or she--i incline to the latter from susan's grin when she thought i had blundered--forms a plan. black steve is called in, and i am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning. that's quick work, you know." "but what do they want?" "yes, that's the question. who had the house before you?" "a retired sea captain, called ferguson." "anything remarkable about him?" "not that ever i heard of." "i was wondering whether he could have buried something. of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the post office bank. but there are always some lunatics about. it would be a dull world without them. at first i thought of some buried valuable. but why, in that case, should they want your furniture? you don't happen to have a raphael or a first folio shakespeare without knowing it?" "no, i don't think i have anything rarer than a crown derby tea-set." "that would hardly justify all this mystery. besides, why should they not openly state what they want? if they covet your tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. no, as i read it, there is something which you do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you did know." "that is how i read it," said i. "dr. watson agrees, so that settles it." "well, mr. holmes, what can it be?" "let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point. you have been in this house a year." "nearly two." "all the better. during this long period no one wants anything from you. now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands. what would you gather from that?" "it can only mean," said i, "that the object, whatever it may be, has only just come into the house." "settled once again," said holmes. "now, mrs. maberley, has any object just arrived?" "no; i have bought nothing new this year." "indeed! that is very remarkable. well, i think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. is that lawyer of yours a capable man?" "mr. sutro is most capable." "have you another maid, or was the fair susan, who has just banged your front door, alone?" "i have a young girl." "try and get sutro to spend a night or two in the house. you might possibly want protection." "against whom?" "who knows? the matter is certainly obscure. if i can't find what they are after, i must approach the matter from the other end, and try to get at the principal. did this house-agent man give any address?" "simply his card and occupation. haines-johnson, auctioneer and valuer." "i don't think we shall find him in the directory. honest business men don't conceal their place of business. well, you will let me know any fresh development. i have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it that i shall see it through." as we passed through the hall holmes's eyes, which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner. the labels shone out upon them. "'milano.' 'lucerne.' these are from italy." "they are poor douglas's things." "you have not unpacked them? how long have you had them?" "they arrived last week." "but you said--why, surely this might be the missing link. how do we know that there is not something of value there?" "there could not possibly be, mr. holmes. poor douglas had only his pay and a small annuity. what could he have of value?" holmes was lost in thought. "delay no longer, mrs. maberley," he said at last. "have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain. i will come to-morrow and hear your report." it was quite evident that the three gables was under very close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow. we came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. holmes clapped his hand to his pocket. "lookin' for your gun, masser holmes?" "no; for my scent-bottle, steve." "you are funny, masser holmes, ain't you?" "it won't be funny for you, steve, if i get after you. i gave you fair warning this morning." "well, masser holmes, i done gone think over what you said, and i don't want no more talk about that affair of masser perkins. s'pose i can help you, masser holmes, i will." "well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job?" "so help me the lord! masser holmes, i told you the truth before. i don't know. my boss barney gives me orders and that's all." "well, just bear in mind, steve, that the lady in that house, and everything under that roof, is under my protection. don't you forget it." "all right, masser holmes. i'll remember.' "i've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, watson," holmes remarked as we walked on. "i think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. it was lucky i had some knowledge of the spencer john crowd, and that steve was one of them. now, watson, this is a case for langdale pike, and i am going to see him now. when i get back i may be clearer in the matter." i saw no more of holmes during the day, but i could well imagine how he spent it, for langdale pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. this strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a st. james's street club, and was the receiving-station, as well as the transmitter, for all the gossip of the metropolis. he made, it was said, a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater for an inquisitive public. if ever, far down in the turbid depths of london life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface. holmes discreetly helped langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn. when i met my friend in his room early next morning, i was conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. it took the shape of the following telegram: "please come out at once. client's house burgled in the night. police in possession. "sutro." holmes whistled. "the drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than i had expected. there is a great driving-power at the back of this business, watson, which does not surprise me after what i have heard. this sutro, of course, is her lawyer. i made a mistake, i fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. this fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. well, there is nothing for it but another journey to harrow weald." we found the three gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day. a small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds. within we met a grey old gentleman, who introduced himself as the lawyer, together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who greeted holmes as an old friend. "well, mr. holmes, no chance for you in this case, i'm afraid. just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. no experts need apply." "i am sure the case is in very good hands," said holmes. "merely a common burglary, you say?" "quite so. we know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. it is that gang of barney stockdale, with the big nigger in it--they've been seen about here." "excellent! what did they get?" "well, they don't seem to have got much. mrs. maberley was chloroformed and the house was---- ah! here is the lady herself." our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maid-servant. "you gave me good advice, mr. holmes," said she, smiling ruefully. "alas, i did not take it! i did not wish to trouble mr. sutro, and so i was unprotected." "i only heard of it this morning," the lawyer explained. "mr. holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. i neglected his advice, and i have paid for it." "you look wretchedly ill," said holmes. "perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred." "it is all here," said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook. "still, if the lady is not too exhausted----" "there is really so little to tell. i have no doubt that wicked susan had planned an entrance for them. they must have known the house to an inch. i was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but i have no notion how long i may have been senseless. when i woke, one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage, which was partially opened and littered over the floor. before he could get away i sprang up and seized him." "you took a big risk," said the inspector. "i clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me, for i can remember no more. mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window. that brought the police, but the rascals had got away." "what did they take?" "well, i don't think there is anything of value missing. i am sure there was nothing in my son's trunks." "did the men leave no clue?" "there was one sheet of paper which i may have torn from the man that i grasped. it was lying all crumpled on the floor. it is in my son's handwriting." "which means that it is not of much use," said the inspector. "now if it had been in the burglar's----" "exactly," said holmes. "what rugged common sense! none the less, i should be curious to see it." the inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book. "i never pass anything, however trifling," said he, with some pomposity. "that is my advice to you, mr. holmes. in twenty-five years' experience i have learned my lesson. there is always the chance of finger-marks or something." holmes inspected the sheet of paper. "what do you make of it, inspector?" "seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as i can see." "it may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale," said holmes. "you have noticed the number on the top of the page. it is two hundred and forty-five. where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages?" "well, i suppose the burglars got those. much good may it do them!" "it seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that. does it suggest anything to you, inspector?" "yes, sir; it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand. i wish them joy of what they got." "why should they go to my son's things?" asked mrs. maberley. "well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck upstairs. that is how i read it. what do you make of it, mr. holmes?" "i must think it over, inspector. come to the window, watson." then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. it began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this: "... face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humiliation. she smiled--yes, by heaven! she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. it was at that moment that love died and hate was born. man must live for something. if it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge." "queer grammar!" said holmes, with a smile, as he handed the paper back to the inspector. "did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to 'my.' the writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero." "it seemed mighty poor stuff," said the inspector, as he replaced it in his book. "what! are you off, mr. holmes?" "i don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands. by the way, mrs. maberley, did you say you wished to travel?" "it has always been my dream, mr. holmes." "where would you like to go--cairo, madeira, the riviera?" "oh! if i had the money i would go round the world." "quite so. round the world. well, good morning. i may drop you a line in the evening." as we passed the window i caught a glimpse of the inspector's smile and shake of the head. "these clever fellows have always a touch of madness." that was what i read in the inspector's smile. "now, watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey," said holmes, when we were back in the roar of central london once more. "i think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as isadora klein." we had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in grosvenor square. holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly. "by the way, watson, i suppose you see it all clearly?" "no, i can't say that i do. i only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief." "exactly! but does the name isadora klein convey nothing to you? she was, of course, the celebrated beauty. there was never a woman to touch her. she is pure spanish, the real blood of the masterful conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in pernambuco for generations. she married the aged german sugar king, klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth. then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes. she had several lovers, and douglas maberley, one of the most striking men in london, was one of them. it was by all accounts more than an adventure with him. he was not a society butterfly, but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. but she is the '_belle dame sans merci_' of fiction. when her caprice is satisfied, the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter can't take her word for it, she knows how to bring it home to him." "then that was his own story----" "ah! you are piecing it together now. i hear that she is about to marry the young duke of lomond, who might almost be her son. his grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a different matter, so it is imperative---- ah! here we are." it was one of the finest corner-houses of the west end. a machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home. "then we shall wait until she is," said holmes cheerfully. the machine broke down. "not at home means not at home to _you_," said the footman. "good," holmes answered. "that means that we shall not have to wait. kindly give this note to your mistress." he scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the man. "what did you say, holmes?" i asked. "i simply wrote 'shall it be the police, then?' i think that should pass us in." it did--with amazing celerity. a minute later we were in an arabian-nights' drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. the lady had come, i felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome. she rose from a settee as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful spanish eyes which looked murder at us both. "what is this intrusion--and this insulting message?" she asked, holding up the slip of paper. "i need not explain, madame. i have too much respect for your intelligence to do so--though i confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late." "how so, sir?" "by supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work. surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him. it was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of young maberley." "i have no idea what you are talking about. what have i to do with hired bullies?" holmes turned away wearily. "yes, i have underrated your intelligence. well, good afternoon!" "stop! where are you going?" "to scotland yard." we had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm. she had turned in a moment from steel to velvet. "come and sit down, gentlemen. let us talk this matter over. i feel that i may be frank with you, mr. holmes. you have the feelings of a gentleman. how quick a woman's instinct is to find it out. i will treat you as a friend." "i cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. i am not the law, but i represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. i am ready to listen, and then i will tell you how i will act." "no doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself." "what was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away." "no, no! i am not so simple. since i have promised to be frank, i may say that no one, save barney stockdale and susan, his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. as to them, well, it is not the first----" she smiled and nodded, with a charming coquettish intimacy. "i see. you've tested them before." "they are good hounds who run silent." "such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them. they will be arrested for this burglary. the police are already after them." "they will take what comes to them. that is what they are paid for. i shall not appear in the matter." "unless i bring you into it." "no, no; you would not. you are a gentleman. it is a woman's secret." "in the first place you must give back this manuscript." she broke into a ripple of laughter, and walked to the fireplace. there was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker. "shall i give this back?" she asked. so roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that i felt of all holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face. however, he was immune from sentiment. "that seals your fate," he said coldly. "you are very prompt in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion." she threw the poker down with a clatter. "how hard you are!" she cried. "may i tell you the whole story?" "i fancy i could tell it to you." "but you must look at it with my eyes, mr. holmes. you must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself?" "the original sin was yours." "yes, yes! i admit it. he was a dear boy, douglas, but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans. he wanted marriage--marriage, mr. holmes--with a penniless commoner. nothing less would serve him. then he became pertinacious. because i had given he seemed to think that i still must give, and to him only. it was intolerable. at last i had to make him realize it." "by hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window." "you do indeed seem to know everything. well, it is true. barney and the boys drove him away, and were, i admit, a little rough in doing so. but what did he do then? could i have believed that a gentleman would do such an act? he wrote a book in which he described his own story. i, of course, was the wolf; he the lamb. it was all there, under different names, of course; but who in all london would have failed to recognize it? what do you say to that, mr. holmes?" "well, he was within his rights." "it was as if the air of italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel italian spirit. he wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that i might have the torture of anticipation. there were two copies, he said--one for me, one for his publisher." "how did you know the publisher's had not reached him?" "i knew who his publisher was. it is not his only novel, you know. i found out that he had not heard from italy. then came douglas's sudden death. so long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me. of course, it must be among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. i set the gang at work. one of them got into the house as servant. i wanted to do the thing honestly. i really and truly did. i was ready to buy the house and everything in it. i offered any price she cared to ask. i only tried the other way when everything else had failed. now, mr. holmes, granting that i was too hard on douglas--and, god knows, i am sorry for it!--what else could i do with my whole future at stake?" sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders. "well, well," said he, "i suppose i shall have to compound a felony as usual. how much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style?" the lady stared in amazement. "could it be done on five thousand pounds?" "well, i should think so, indeed!" "very good. i think you will sign me a cheque for that, and i will see that it comes to mrs. maberley. you owe her a little change of air. meantime, lady"--he wagged a cautionary forefinger--"have a care! have a care! you can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those dainty hands." v the adventure of the sussex vampire holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me. "for a mixture of the modern and the mediæval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, i think this is surely the limit," said he. "what do you make of it, watson?" i read as follows: 46, old jewry, _nov._ 19_th._ _re_ vampires. sir,-- our client, mr. robert ferguson, of ferguson and muirhead, tea brokers, of mincing lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. as our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended mr. ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. we have not forgotten your successful action in the case of matilda briggs. we are, sir, faithfully yours, morrison, morrison, and dodd. per e. j. c. "matilda briggs was not the name of a young woman, watson," said holmes, in a reminiscent voice. "it was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. but what do we know about vampires? does it come within our purview either? anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a grimm's fairy tale. make a long arm, watson, and see what v has to say." i leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime. "voyage of the gloria scott," he read. "that was a bad business. i have some recollection that you made a record of it, watson, though i was unable to congratulate you upon the result. victor lynch, the forger. venomous lizard or gila. remarkable case, that! vittoria, the circus belle. vanderbilt and the yeggman. vipers. vigor, the hammersmith wonder. hullo! hullo! good old index. you can't beat it. listen to this, watson. vampirism in hungary. and again, vampires in transylvania." he turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment. "rubbish, watson, rubbish! what have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? it's pure lunacy." "but surely," said i, "the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? a living person might have the habit. i have read, for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth." "you are right, watson. it mentions the legend in one of these references. but are we to give serious attention to such things? this agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. the world is big enough for us. no ghosts need apply. i fear that we cannot take mr. robert ferguson very seriously. possibly this note may be from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him." he took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first. this he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. when he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie. "cheeseman's, lamberley. where is lamberley, watson?" "it is in sussex, south of horsham." "not very far, eh? and cheeseman's?" "i know that country, holmes. it is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. you get odley's and harvey's and carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses." "precisely," said holmes coldly. it was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. "i rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about cheeseman's, lamberley, before we are through. the letter is, as i had hoped, from robert ferguson. by the way, he claims acquaintance with you." "with me!" "you had better read it." he handed the letter across. it was headed with the address quoted. dear mr. holmes, (it said)--i have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. it concerns a friend for whom i am acting. this gentleman married some five years ago a peruvian lady, the daughter of a peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. the lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. he felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. this was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have--to all appearance absolutely devoted. now for the point which i will make more plain when we meet. indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. the lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. the gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. this boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm. this was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. on one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. a loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. as she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. there was a small wound in the neck, from which a stream of blood had escaped. the nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so, and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. no explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over. it left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. it seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. it must read most incredible to you, and yet i beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it. at last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. the nurse's nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. to him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. he knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? he told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. whilst they were talking, a sudden cry of pain was heard. nurse and master rushed together to the nursery. imagine his feelings, mr. holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. with a cry of horror, he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. it was she--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's blood. so the matter stands. she is now confined to her room. there has been no explanation. the husband is half demented. he knows, and i know, little of vampirism beyond the name. we had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. and yet here in the very heart of the english sussex--well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. will you see me? will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? if so, kindly wire to ferguson, cheeseman's, lamberley, and i will be at your rooms by ten o'clock. yours faithfully, robert ferguson. ps.--i believe your friend watson played rugby for blackheath when i was three-quarter for richmond. it is the only personal introduction which i can give. "of course i remember him," said i, as i laid down the letter. "big bob ferguson, the finest three-quarter richmond ever had. he was always a good-natured chap. it's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case." holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head. "i never get your limits, watson," said he. "there are unexplored possibilities about you. take a wire down, like a good fellow. 'will examine your case with pleasure.'" "_your_ case!" "we must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. of course it is his case. send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning." promptly at ten o'clock next morning ferguson strode into our room. i had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back. there is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. his great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. i fear that i roused corresponding emotions in him. "hullo, watson," said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. "you don't look quite the man you did when i threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the old deer park. i expect i have changed a bit also. but it's this last day or two that has aged me. i see by your telegram, mr. holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy." "it is simpler to deal direct," said holmes. "of course it is. but you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. what can i do? how am i to go to the police with such a story? and yet the kiddies have got to be protected. is it madness, mr. holmes? is it something in the blood? have you any similar case in your experience? for god's sake, give me some advice, for i am at my wits' end." "very naturally, mr. ferguson. now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. i can assure you that i am very far from being at my wits' end, and that i am confident we shall find some solution. first of all, tell me what steps you have taken. is your wife still near the children?" "we had a dreadful scene. she is a most loving woman, mr. holmes. if ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. she was cut to the heart that i should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. she would not even speak. she gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. since then she has refused to see me. she has a maid who was with her before her marriage, dolores by name--a friend rather than a servant. she takes her food to her." "then the child is in no immediate danger?" "mrs. mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. i can absolutely trust her. i am more uneasy about poor little jack, for, as i told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her." "but never wounded?" "no; she struck him savagely. it is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple." ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. "you would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart. a fall in childhood and a twisted spine, mr. holmes. but the dearest, most loving heart within." holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. "what other inmates are there in your house, mr. ferguson?" "two servants who have not been long with us. one stable-hand, michael, who sleeps in the house. my wife, myself, my boy jack, baby, dolores, and mrs. mason. that is all." "i gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?" "i had only known her a few weeks." "how long had this maid dolores been with her?" "some years." "then your wife's character would really be better known by dolores than by you?" "yes, you may say so." holmes made a note. "i fancy," said he, "that i may be of more use at lamberley than here. it is eminently a case for personal investigation. if the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. of course, we would stay at the inn." ferguson gave a gesture of relief. "it is what i hoped, mr. holmes. there is an excellent train at two from victoria, if you could come." "of course we could come. there is a lull at present. i can give you my undivided energies. watson, of course, comes with us. but there are one or two points upon which i wish to be very sure before i start. this unhappy lady, as i understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?" "that is so." "but the assaults take different forms, do they not? she has beaten your son." "once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands." "did she give no explanation why she struck him?" "none, save that she hated him. again and again she said so." "well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. a posthumous jealousy, we will say. is the lady jealous by nature?" "yes, she is very jealous--jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love." "but the boy--he is fifteen, i understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. did he give you no explanation of these assaults?" "no; he declared there was no reason." "were they good friends at other times?" "no; there was never any love between them." "yet you say he is affectionate?" "never in the world could there be so devoted a son. my life is his life. he is absorbed in what i say or do." once again holmes made a note. for some time he sat lost in thought. "no doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. you were thrown very close together, were you not?" "very much so." "and the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?" "most devoted." "he would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. there is one other point about these assaults. were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?" "in the first case it was so. it was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. in the second case it was only jack who suffered. mrs. mason had no complaint to make about the baby." "that certainly complicates matters." "i don't quite follow you, mr. holmes." "possibly not. one forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. a bad habit, mr. ferguson; but human nature is weak. i fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. however, i will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at victoria at two o'clock." it was evening of a dull, foggy november day when, having left our bags at the "chequers," lamberley, we drove through the sussex clay of a long winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient farm-house in which ferguson dwelt. it was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of horsham slabs. the doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man, after the original builder. within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. an odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building. there was one very large central room, into which ferguson led us. here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire. the room, as i gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. the half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. they were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of south american utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the peruvian lady upstairs. holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. he returned with his eyes full of thought. "hullo!" he cried. "hullo!" a spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. it came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. its hind-legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. it licked ferguson's hand. "what is it, mr. holmes?" "the dog. what's the matter with it?" "that's what puzzled the vet. a sort of paralysis. spinal meningitis, he thought. but it is passing. he'll be all right soon--won't you, carlo?" a shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. the dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. he knew that we were discussing his case. "did it come on suddenly?" "in a single night." "how long ago?" "it may have been four months ago." "very remarkable. very suggestive." "what do you see in it, mr. holmes?" "a confirmation of what i had already thought." "for god's sake, what do you think, mr. holmes? it may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! my wife a would-be murderer--my child in constant danger! don't play with me, mr. holmes. it is too terribly serious." the big rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm. "i fear that there is pain for you, mr. ferguson, whatever the solution may be," said he. "i would spare you all i can. i cannot say more for the instant, but before i leave this house i hope i may have something definite." "please god you may! if you will excuse me, gentlemen, i will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change." he was away some minutes, during which holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. when our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. he brought with him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl. "the tea is ready, dolores," said ferguson. "see that your mistress has everything she can wish." "she verra ill," cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. "she no ask for food. she verra ill. she need doctor. i frightened stay alone with her without doctor." ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes. "i should be so glad if i could be of use." "would your mistress see dr. watson?" "i take him. i no ask leave. she needs doctor." "then i'll come with you at once." i followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. at the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. it struck me as i looked at it that if ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. the girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. i passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her. on the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. she was only half conscious, but as i entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. i stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while i took her pulse and temperature. both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure. "she lie like that one day, two day. i 'fraid she die," said the girl. the woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me. "where is my husband?" "he is below, and would wish to see you." "i will not see him. i will not see him." then she seemed to wander off into delirium. "a fiend! a fiend! oh, what shall i do with this devil?" "can i help you in any way?" "no. no one can help. it is finished. all is destroyed. do what i will, all is destroyed." the woman must have some strange delusion. i could not see honest bob ferguson in the character of fiend or devil. "madame," i said, "your husband loves you dearly. he is deeply grieved at this happening." again she turned on me those glorious eyes. "he loves me. yes. but do i not love him? do i not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart. that is how i love him. and yet he could think of me--he could speak of me so." "he is full of grief, but he cannot understand. "no, he cannot understand. but he should trust." "will you not see him?" i suggested. "no, no; i cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. i will not see him. go now. you can do nothing for me. tell him only one thing. i want my child. i have a right to my child. that is the only message i can send him." she turned her face to the wall and would say no more. i returned to the room downstairs, where ferguson and holmes still sat by the fire. ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview. "how can i send her the child?" he said. "how do i know what strange impulse might come upon her? how can i ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips?" he shuddered at the recollection. "the child is safe with mrs. mason, and there he must remain." a smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. as she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. he was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. he rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl. "oh, daddy," he cried, "i did not know that you were due yet. i should have been here to meet you. oh, i am so glad to see you!" ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment. "dear old chap," said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. "i came early because my friends, mr. holmes and dr. watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us." "is that mr. holmes, the detective?" "yes." the youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze. "what about your other child, mr. ferguson?" asked holmes. "might we make the acquaintance of the baby?" "ask mrs. mason to bring baby down," said ferguson. the boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the saxon and the latin. ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly. "fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him," he muttered, as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat. it was at this moment that i chanced to glance at holmes, and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. his face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. following his gaze i could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. it is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that holmes was fixing his concentrated attention. then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. on its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. without speaking, holmes examined it with care. finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him. "good-bye, little man. you have made a strange start in life. nurse, i should wish to have a word with you in private." he took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. i only heard the last words, which were: "your anxiety will soon, i hope, be set at rest." the woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child. "what is mrs. mason like?" asked holmes. "not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child." "do you like her, jack?" holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. his expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head. "jacky has very strong likes and dislikes," said ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. "luckily i am one of his likes." the boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. ferguson gently disengaged him. "run away, little jacky," said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. "now, mr. holmes," he continued, when the boy was gone, "i really feel that i have brought you on a fool's errand, for what can you possibly do, save give me your sympathy? it must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view." "it is certainly delicate," said my friend, with an amused smile, "but i have not been struck up to now with its complexity. it has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. i had, in fact, reached it before we left baker street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation." ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead. "for heaven's sake, holmes," he said hoarsely, "if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. how do i stand? what shall i do? i care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them." "certainly i owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. but you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? is the lady capable of seeing us, watson?" "she is ill, but she is quite rational." "very good. it is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. let us go up to her." "she will not see me," cried ferguson. "oh, yes, she will," said holmes. he scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. "you at least have the _entrée_, watson. will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?" i ascended again and handed the note to dolores, who cautiously opened the door. a minute later i heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. dolores looked out. "she will see them. she will leesten," said she. at my summons ferguson and holmes came up. as we entered the room ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. he sank into an arm-chair, while holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement. "i think we can dispense with dolores," said holmes. "oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed i can see no objection. now, mr. ferguson, i am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. the swiftest surgery is the least painful. let me first say what will ease your mind. your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman." ferguson sat up with a cry of joy. "prove that, mr. holmes, and i am your debtor for ever." "i will do so, but in doing so i must wound you deeply in another direction." "i care nothing so long as you clear my wife. everything on earth is insignificant compared to that." "let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in baker street. the idea of a vampire was to me absurd. such things do not happen in criminal practice in england. and yet your observation was precise. you had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips." "i did." "did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? was there not a queen in english history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?" "poison!" "a south american household. my instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. it might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. when i saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what i expected to see. if the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out. "and the dog! if one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? i did not foresee the dog, but at least i understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction. "now do you understand? your wife feared such an attack. she saw it made and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart." "jacky!" "i watched him as you fondled the child just now. his face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. i saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as i have seldom seen in a human face." "my jacky!" "you have to face it, mr. ferguson. it is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. his very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness." "good god! it is incredible!" "have i spoken the truth, madame?" the lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. now she turned to her husband. "how could i tell you, bob? i felt the blow it would be to you. it was better that i should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. when this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, i was glad." "i think a year at sea would be my prescription for master jacky," said holmes, rising from his chair. "only one thing is still clouded, madame. we can quite understand your attacks upon master jacky. there is a limit to a mother's patience. but how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?" "i had told mrs. mason. she knew." "exactly. so i imagined." ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering. "this, i fancy, is the time for our exit, watson," said holmes in a whisper. "if you will take one elbow of the too faithful dolores, i will take the other. there, now," he added, as he closed the door behind him, "i think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves." i have only one further note of this case. it is the letter which holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. it ran thus: baker street, _nov._ 21st. _re_ vampires. sir,-- referring to your letter of the 19th, i beg to state that i have looked into the inquiry of your client, mr. robert ferguson, of ferguson and muirhead, tea brokers, of mincing lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. with thanks for your recommendation, i am, sir, faithfully yours, sherlock holmes. vi the adventure of the three garridebs it may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. it cost one man his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law. yet there was certainly an element of comedy. well, you shall judge for yourselves. i remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. i only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position of partner and confidant i am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion. i repeat, however, that this enables me to fix the date, which was the latter end of june, 1902, shortly after the conclusion of the south african war. holmes had spent several days in bed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere grey eyes. "there is a chance for you to make some money, friend watson," said he. "have you ever heard the name of garrideb?" i admitted that i had not. "well, if you can lay your hand upon a garrideb, there's money in it." "why?" "ah, that's a long story--rather a whimsical one, too. i don't think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular. the fellow will be here presently for cross-examination, so i won't open the matter up till he comes. but meanwhile, that's the name we want." the telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and i turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest. but to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place. i gave a cry of triumph. "here you are, holmes! here it is!" holmes took the book from my hand. "'garrideb, n.,'" he read, "'136 little ryder street, w.' sorry to disappoint you, my dear watson, but this is the man himself. that is the address upon his letter. we want another to match him." mrs. hudson had come in with a card upon a tray. i took it up and glanced at it. "why, here it is!" i cried in amazement. "this is a different initial. john garrideb, counsellor at law, moorville, kansas, u.s.a." holmes smiled as he looked at the card. "i am afraid you must make yet another effort, watson," said he. "this gentleman is also in the plot already, though i certainly did not expect to see him this morning. however, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which i want to know." a moment later he was in the room. mr. john garrideb, counsellor at law, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face characteristic of so many american men of affairs. the general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face. his eyes, however, were arresting. seldom in any human head have i seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so responsive to every change of thought. his accent was american, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech. "mr. holmes?" he asked, glancing from one to the other. "ah, yes! your pictures are not unlike you, sir, if i may say so. i believe you have had a letter from my namesake, mr. nathan garrideb, have you not?" "pray sit down," said sherlock holmes. "we shall, i fancy, have a good deal to discuss." he took up his sheets of foolscap. "you are, of course, the mr. john garrideb mentioned in this document. but surely you have been in england some time?" "why do you say that, mr. holmes?" i seemed to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes. "your whole outfit is english." mr. garrideb forced a laugh. "i've read of your tricks, mr. holmes, but i never thought i would be the subject of them. where do you read that?" "the shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your boots--could anyone doubt it?" "well, well, i had no idea i was so obvious a britisher. but business brought me over here some time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is nearly all london. however, i guess your time is of value, and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks. what about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand?" holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor, whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable expression. "patience! patience, mr. garrideb!" said my friend in a soothing voice. "dr. watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter. but why did mr. nathan garrideb not come with you?" "why did he ever drag you into it at all?" asked our visitor, with a sudden outflame of anger. "what in thunder had you to do with it? here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and one of them must needs call in a detective! i saw him this morning, and he told me this fool-trick he had played me, and that's why i am here. but i feel bad about it, all the same." "there was no reflection upon you, mr. garrideb. it was simply zeal upon his part to gain your end--an end which is, i understand, equally vital for both of you. he knew that i had means of getting information, and, therefore, it was very natural that he should apply to me." our visitor's angry face gradually cleared. "well, that puts it different," said he. "when i went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective, i just asked for your address and came right away. i don't want police butting into a private matter. but if you are content just to help us find the man, there can be no harm in that." "well, that is just how it stands," said holmes. "and now, sir, since you are here, we had best have a clear account from your own lips. my friend here knows nothing of the details." mr. garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze. "need he know?" he asked. "we usually work together." "well, there's no reason it should be kept a secret. i'll give you the facts as short as i can make them. if you came from kansas i would not need to explain to you who alexander hamilton garrideb was. he made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at chicago, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your counties, lying along the arkansas river, west of fort dodge. it's grazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-land, and just every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it. "he had no kith nor kin--or, if he had, i never heard of it. but he took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. that was what brought us together. i was in the law at topeka, and one day i had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another man with his own name. it was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find out if there were any more garridebs in the world. 'find me another!' said he. i told him i was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking round the world in search of garridebs. 'none the less,' said he, 'that is just what you will do if things pan out as i planned them.' i thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words, as i was soon to discover. "for he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind him. it was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the state of kansas. his property was divided into three parts, and i was to have one on condition that i found two garridebs who would share the remainder. it's five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we can't lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row. "it was so big a chance that i just let my legal practice slide and i set forth looking for garridebs. there is not one in the united states. i went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a garrideb could i catch. then i tried the old country. sure enough there was the name in the london telephone directory. i went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. but he is a lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. it says three adult men in the will. so you see we still have a vacancy, and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges." "well, watson," said holmes, with a smile, "i said it was rather whimsical, did i not? i should have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers." "i have done that, mr. holmes. no replies." "dear me! well, it is certainly a most curious little problem. i may take a glance at it in my leisure. by the way, it is curious that you should have come from topeka. i used to have a correspondent--he is dead now--old dr. lysander starr, who was mayor in 1890." "good old dr. starr!" said our visitor. "his name is still honoured. well, mr. holmes, i suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress. i reckon you will hear within a day or two." with this assurance our american bowed and departed. holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some time with a curious smile upon his face. "well?" i asked at last. "i am wondering, watson--just wondering!" "at what?" holmes took his pipe from his lips. "i was wondering, watson, what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies. i nearly asked him so--for there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy--but i judged it better to let him think he had fooled us. here is a man with an english coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a year's wear, and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial american lately landed in london. there have been no advertisements in the agony columns. you know that i miss nothing there. they are my favourite covert for putting up a bird, and i would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. i never knew a dr. lysander starr of topeka. touch him where you would he was false. i think the fellow is really an american, but he has worn his accent smooth with years of london. what is his game, then, and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for garridebs? it's worth our attention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is certainly a complex and ingenious one. we must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also. just ring him up, watson." i did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at the other end of the line. "yes, yes, i am mr. nathan garrideb. is mr. holmes there? i should very much like to have a word with mr. holmes." my friend took the instrument and i heard the usual syncopated dialogue. "yes, he has been here. i understand that you don't know him.... how long? ... only two days! ... yes, yes, of course, it is a most captivating prospect. will you be at home this evening? i suppose your namesake will not be there? ... very good, we will come then, for i would rather have a chat without him.... dr. watson will come with me.... i understood from your note that you did not go out often.... well, we shall be round about six. you need not mention it to the american lawyer.... very good. good-bye!" it was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and even little ryder street, one of the smaller offshoots from the edgware road, within a stone-cast of old tyburn tree of evil memory, looked golden and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun. the particular house to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, early georgian edifice with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay windows on the ground floor. it was on this ground floor that our client lived, and, indeed, the low windows proved to be the front of the huge room in which he spent his waking hours. holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name. "up some years, watson," he remarked, indicating its discoloured surface. "it's his real name, anyhow, and that is something to note." the house had a common stair, and there were a number of names painted in the hall some indicating offices and some private chambers. it was not a collection of residential flats, but rather the abode of bohemian bachelors. our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at four o'clock. mr. nathan garrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald, some sixty-odd years of age. he had a cadaverous face, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown. large round spectacles and a small projecting goat's beard combined with his stooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity. the general effect, however, was amiable, though eccentric. the room was as curious as its occupant. it looked like a small museum. it was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical. cases of butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance. a large table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up amongst them. as i glanced round i was surprised at the universality of the man's interests. here was a case of ancient coins. there was a cabinet of flint instruments. behind his central table was a large cupboard of fossil bones. above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as "neanderthal," "heidelberg," "cromagnon" printed beneath them. it was clear that he was a student of many subjects. as he stood in front of us now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which he was polishing a coin. "syracusan--of the best period," he explained, holding it up. "they degenerated greatly towards the end. at their best i hold them supreme, though some prefer the alexandrian school. you will find a chair here, mr. holmes. pray allow me to clear these bones. and you, sir--ah, yes, dr. watson--if you would have the goodness to put the japanese vase to one side. you see round me my little interests in life. my doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should i go out when i have so much to hold me here? i can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months." holmes looked round him with curiosity. "but do you tell me that you _never_ go out?" he said "now and again i drive down to sotheby's or christie's. otherwise i very seldom leave my room. i am not too strong, and my researches are very absorbing. but you can imagine, mr. holmes, what a terrific shock--pleasant but terrific--it was for me when i heard of this unparalleled good fortune. it only needs one more garrideb to complete the matter, and surely we can find one. i had a brother, but he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. but there must surely be others in the world. i had heard that you handled strange cases, and that was why i sent to you. of course, this american gentleman is quite right, and i should have taken his advice first, but i acted for the best." "i think you acted very wisely indeed," said holmes. "but are you really anxious to acquire an estate in america?" "certainly not, sir. nothing would induce me to leave my collection. but this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim. five million dollars was the sum named. there are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection, and which i am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. just think what i could do with five million dollars. why, i have the nucleus of a national collection. i shall be the hans sloane of my age." his eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles. it was very clear that no pains would be spared by mr. nathan garrideb in finding a namesake. "i merely called to make your acquaintance, and there is no reason why i should interrupt your studies," said holmes. "i prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom i do business. there are few questions i need ask, for i have your very clear narrative in my pocket, and i filled up the blanks when this american gentleman called. i understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence." "that is so. he called last tuesday." "did he tell you of our interview to-day?" "yes, he came straight back to me. he had been very angry." "why should he be angry?" "he seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour. but he was quite cheerful again when he returned." "did he suggest any course of action?" "no, sir, he did not." "has he had, or asked for, any money from you?" "no, sir, never!" "you see no possible object he has in view?" "none, except what he states." "did you tell him of our telephone appointment?" "yes, sir, i did." holmes was lost in thought. i could see that he was puzzled. "have you any articles of great value in your collection?" "no, sir. i am not a rich man. it is a good collection, but not a very valuable one." "you have no fear of burglars?" "not the least." "how long have you been in these rooms?" "nearly five years." holmes's cross-examination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at the door. no sooner had our client unlatched it than the american lawyer burst excitedly into the room. "here you are!" he cried, waving a paper over his head. "i thought i should be in time to get you. mr. nathan garrideb, my congratulations! you are a rich man, sir. our business is happily finished and all is well. as to you, mr. holmes, we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble." he handed over the paper to our client, who stood staring at a marked advertisement. holmes and i leaned forward and read it over his shoulder. this is how it ran: +-----------------------------------------------------+ | | | howard garrideb. | | | | constructor of agricultural machinery. | | | | binders, reapers' steam and hand plows, drills, | | harrows, farmers' carts, buckboards, and all other | | appliances. | | | | estimates for artesian wells. | | | | apply grosvenor buildings, aston. | | | +-----------------------------------------------------+ "glorious!" gasped our host. "that makes our third man." "i had opened up inquiries in birmingham," said the american, "and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper. we must hustle and put the thing through. i have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock." "you want _me_ to see him?" "what do you say, mr. holmes? don't you think it would be wiser? here am i, a wandering american with a wonderful tale. why should he believe what i tell him? but you are a britisher with solid references, and he is bound to take notice of what you say. i would go with you if you wished, but i have a very busy day to-morrow, and i could always follow you if you are in any trouble." "well, i have not made such a journey for years." "it is nothing, mr. garrideb. i have figured out your connections. you leave at twelve and should be there soon after two. then you can be back the same night. all you have to do is to see this man, explain the matter, and get an affidavit of his existence. by the lord!" he added hotly, "considering i've come all the way from the centre of america, it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through." "quite so," said holmes. "i think what this gentleman says is very true." mr. nathan garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air. "well, if you insist i shall go," said he. "it is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything, considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life." "then that is agreed," said holmes, "and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can." "i'll see to that," said the american. "well," he added, looking at his watch, "i'll have to get on. i'll call to-morrow, mr. nathan, and see you off to birmingham. coming my way, mr. holmes? well, then, good-bye, and we may have good news for you to-morrow night." i noticed that my friend's face cleared when the american left the room, and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished. "i wish i could look over your collection, mr. garrideb," said he. "in my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of yours is a storehouse of it." our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big glasses. "i had always heard, sir, that you were a very intelligent man," said he. "i could take you round now, if you have the time." "unfortunately, i have not. but these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation. if i should be able to look in to-morrow, i presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them?" "none at all. you are most welcome. the place will, of course, be shut up, but mrs. saunders is in the basement up to four o'clock and would let you in with her key." "well, i happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon. if you would say a word to mrs. saunders it would be quite in order. by the way, who is your house-agent?" our client was amazed at the sudden question. "holloway and steele, in the edgware road. but why?" "i am a bit of an archæologist myself when it comes to houses," said holmes, laughing. "i was wondering if this was queen anne or georgian." "georgian, beyond doubt." "really. i should have thought a little earlier. however, it is easily ascertained. well, good-bye, mr. garrideb, and may you have every success in your birmingham journey." the house-agent's was close by, but we found that it was closed for the day, so we made our way back to baker street. it was not till after dinner that holmes reverted to the subject. "our little problem draws to a close," said he. "no doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind." "i can make neither head nor tail of it." "the head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to-morrow. did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement?" "i saw that the word 'plough' was misspelt." "oh, you did notice that, did you? come, watson, you improve all the time. yes, it was bad english but good american. the printer had set it up as received. then the buckboards. that is american also. and artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. it was a typical american advertisement, but purporting to be from an english firm. what do you make of that?" "i can only suppose that this american lawyer put it in himself. what his object was i fail to understand." "well, there are alternative explanations. anyhow, he wanted to get this good old fossil up to birmingham. that is very clear. i might have told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose chase, but, on second thoughts, it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go. to-morrow, watson--well, to-morrow will speak for itself." holmes was up and out early. when he returned at lunch-time i noticed that his face was very grave. "this is a more serious matter than i had expected, watson," said he. "it is fair to tell you so, though i know it will only be an additional reason to you for running your head into danger. i should know my watson by now. but there is danger, and you should know it." "well, it is not the first we have shared, holmes. i hope it may not be the last. what is the particular danger this time?" "we are up against a very hard case. i have identified mr. john garrideb, counsellor at law. he is none other than 'killer' evans, of sinister and murderous reputation." "i fear i am none the wiser." "ah, it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable newgate calendar in your memory. i have been down to see friend lestrade at the yard. there may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there, but they lead the world for thoroughness and method. i had an idea that we might get on the track of our american friend in their records. sure enough, i found his chubby face smiling up at me from the rogues' portrait gallery. james winter, _alias_ morecroft, _alias_ killer evans, was the inscription below." holmes drew an envelope from his pocket. "i scribbled down a few points from his dossier. aged forty-four. native of chicago. known to have shot three men in the states. escaped from penitentiary through political influence. came to london in 1893. shot a man over cards in a night club in the waterloo road in january, 1895. man died, but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. dead man was identified as rodger prescott, famous as forger and coiner in chicago. killer evans released in 1901. has been under police supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. very dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. that is our bird, watson--a sporting bird, as you must admit." "but what is his game?" "well, it begins to define itself. i have been to the house-agents. our client, as he told us, has been there five years. it was unlet for a year before then. the previous tenant was a gentleman at large named waldron. waldron's appearance was well remembered at the office. he had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him. he was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. now, prescott, the man whom killer evans had shot, was, according to scotland yard, a tall, dark man with a beard. as a working hypothesis, i think we may take it that prescott, the american criminal, used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. so at last we get a link, you see." "and the next link?" "well, we must go now and look for that." he took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me. "i have my old favourite with me. if our wild west friend tries to live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. i'll give you an hour for a siesta, watson, and then i think it will be time for our ryder street adventure." it was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of nathan garrideb. mrs. saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a spring lock and holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left. shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house. holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. there was one cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. it was behind this that we eventually crouched, while holmes in a whisper outlined his intentions. "he wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room--that is very clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to do it. the whole of this garrideb invention was apparently for no other end. i must say, watson, that there is a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him an opening which he could hardly have expected. he wove his plot with remarkable cunning." "but what did he want?" "well, that is what we are here to find out. it has nothing whatever to do with our client, so far as i can read the situation. it is something connected with the man he murdered--the man who may have been his confederate in crime. there is some guilty secret in the room. that is how i read it. at first i thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knew--something worth the attention of a big criminal. but the fact that rodger prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason. well, watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring." that hour was not long in striking. we crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the outer door open and shut. then came the sharp, metallic snap of a key, and the american was in the room. he closed the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do and how to do it. he pushed the table to one side, tore up the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back, and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and worked vigorously upon the floor. presently we heard the sound of sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the planks. killer evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view. clearly our moment had come. holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and together we stole across to the open trapdoor. gently as we moved, however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head of our american, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the open space. his face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage, which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pistols were pointed at his head. "well, well!" said he, coolly, as he scrambled to the surface. "i guess you have been one too many for me, mr. holmes. saw through my game, i suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. well, sir, i hand it to you; you have me beat and----" in an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired two shots. i felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to my thigh. there was a crash as holmes's pistol came down on the man's head. i had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while holmes rummaged him for weapons. then my friend's wiry arms were round me and he was leading me to a chair. "you're not hurt, watson? for god's sake, say that you are not hurt!" it was worth a wound--it was worth many wounds--to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. the clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. for the one and only time i caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. all my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation. "it's nothing, holmes. it's a mere scratch." he had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife. "you are right," he cried, with an immense sigh of relief. "it is quite superficial." his face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. "by the lord, it is as well for you. if you had killed watson, you would not have got out of this room alive. now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?" he had nothing to say for himself. he only lay and scowled. i leaned on holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar which had been disclosed by the secret flap. it was still illuminated by the candle which evans had taken down with him. our eyes fell upon a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat little bundles. "a printing press--a counterfeiter's outfit," said holmes. "yes, sir," said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then sinking into the chair. "the greatest counterfeiter london ever saw. that's prescott's machine, and those bundles on the table are two thousand of prescott's notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere. help yourselves, gentlemen. call it a deal and let me beat it." holmes laughed. "we don't do things like that, mr. evans. there is no bolt-hole for you in this country. you shot this man prescott, did you not?" "yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on me. five years--when i should have had a medal the size of a soup plate. no living man could tell a prescott from a bank of england, and if i hadn't put him out he would have flooded london with them. i was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. can you wonder that i wanted to get to the place? and can you wonder that when i found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, i had to do the best i could to shift him? maybe i would have been wiser if i had put him away. it would have been easy enough, but i'm a soft-hearted guy that can't begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also. but say, mr. holmes, what have i done wrong, anyhow? i've not used this plant. i've not hurt this old stiff. where do you get me?" "only attempted murder, so far as i can see," said holmes. "but that's not our job. they take that at the next stage. what we wanted at present was just your sweet self. please give the yard a call, watson. it won't be entirely unexpected." so those were the facts about killer evans and his remarkable invention of the three garridebs. we heard later that our poor old friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams. when his castle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins. he was last heard of at a nursing-home in brixton. it was a glad day at the yard when the prescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew that it existed, they had never been able, after the death of the man, to find out where it was. evans had indeed done great service and caused several worthy c.i.d. men to sleep the sounder, for the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger. they would willingly have subscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the criminal had spoken, but an unappreciative bench took a less favourable view, and the killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged. vii the problem of thor bridge somewhere in the vaults of the bank of cox and co., at charing cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, john h. watson, m.d., late indian army, painted upon the lid. it is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which mr. sherlock holmes had at various times to examine. some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. a problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. among these unfinished tales is that of mr. james phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. no less remarkable is that of the cutter _alicia_, which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. a third case worthy of note is that of isadora persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a matchbox in front of him which contained a remarkable worm, said to be unknown to science. apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. i need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. there remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which i might have edited before had i not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others i revere. in some i was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others i was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. the following narrative is drawn from my own experience. it was a wild morning in october, and i observed as i was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. i descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. on the contrary, i found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments. "you have a case, holmes?" i remarked. "the faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, watson," he answered. "it has enabled you to probe my secret. yes, i have a case. after a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more." "might i share it?" "there is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the _family herald_ which i observed yesterday upon the hall-table. even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time, and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical." a quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. he had drawn a letter from his pocket. "you have heard of neil gibson, the gold king?" he said. "you mean the american senator?" "well, he was once senator for some western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world." "yes, i know of him. he has surely lived in england for some time. his name is very familiar." "yes; he bought a considerable estate in hampshire some five years ago. possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?" "of course. i remember it now. that is why the name is familiar. but i really know nothing of the details." holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. "i had no idea that the case was coming my way or i should have had my extracts ready," said he. "the fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. the interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. that was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in the police-court proceedings. it is now referred to the assizes at winchester. i fear it is a thankless business. i can discover facts, watson, but i cannot change them. unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light i do not see what my client can hope for." "your client?" "ah, i forgot i had not told you. i am getting into your involved habit, watson, of telling a story backwards. you had best read this first." the letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows: claridge's hotel, _october_ 3_rd_. dear mr. sherlock holmes,-- i can't see the best woman god ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. i can't explain things--i can't even try to explain them, but i know beyond all doubt that miss dunbar is innocent. you know the facts--who doesn't? it has been the gossip of the country. and never a voice raised for her! it's the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. that woman has a heart that wouldn't let her kill a fly. well, i'll come at eleven to-morrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. maybe i have a clue and don't know it. anyhow, all i know and all i have and all i am are for your use if only you can save her. if ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case. yours faithfully, j. neil gibson. "there you have it," said sherlock holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. "that is the gentleman i await. as to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so i must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. this man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as i understand, of most violent and formidable character. he married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom i know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. these are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor-house, the centre of an historical english estate. then as to the tragedy. the wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. no weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. no weapon near her, watson--mark that! the crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o'clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?" "it is all very clear. but why suspect the governess?" "well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. a revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe." his eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, "on--the--floor--of--her--wardrobe." then he sank into silence, and i saw that some train of thought had been set moving which i should be foolish to interrupt. suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. "yes, watson, it was found. pretty damning, eh? so the two juries thought. then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. how's that? finally, there is the motive. senator gibson is an attractive person. if his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer. love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. ugly, watson--very ugly!" "yes, indeed, holmes." "nor could she prove an alibi. on the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near thor bridge--that was the scene of the tragedy--about that hour. she couldn't deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there." "that really seems final." "and yet, watson--and yet! this bridge--a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides--carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. thor mere it is called. in the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. such are the main facts. but here, if i mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time." billy had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an unexpected one. mr. marlow bates was a stranger to both of us. he was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes, and a twitching, hesitating manner--a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown. "you seem agitated, mr. bates," said holmes. "pray sit down. i fear i can only give you a short time, for i have an appointment at eleven." "i know you have," our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath. "mr. gibson is coming. mr. gibson is my employer. i am manager of his estate. mr. holmes, he is a villain--an infernal villain." "strong language, mr. bates." "i have to be emphatic, mr. holmes, for the time is so limited. i would not have him find me here for the world. he is almost due now. but i was so situated that i could not come earlier. his secretary, mr. ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you." "and you are his manager?" "i have given him notice. in a couple of weeks i shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. a hard man, mr. holmes, hard to all about him. those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. but his wife was his chief victim. he was brutal to her--yes, sir, brutal! how she came by her death i do not know, but i am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. she was a creature of the tropics, a brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know?" "no; it had escaped me." "tropical by birth and tropical by nature. a child of the sun and of passion. she had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded--i am told that they once were great--there was nothing to hold him. we all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. but he is plausible and cunning. that is all i have to say to you. don't take him at his face value. there is more behind. now i'll go. no, no, don't detain me! he is almost due." with a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared. "well! well!" said holmes, after an interval of silence. "mr. gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. but the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears." sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. as i looked upon him i understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager, but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. if i were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, i should choose mr. neil gibson as my model. his tall, gaunt craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. an abraham lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. his face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. cold grey eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. he bowed in perfunctory fashion as holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him. "let me say right here, mr. holmes," he began, "that money is nothing to me in this case. you can burn it if it's any use in lighting you to the truth. this woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it's up to you to do it. name your figure!" "my professional charges are upon a fixed scale," said holmes coldly. "i do not vary them, save when i remit them altogether." "well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. if you pull this off every paper in england and america will be booming you. you'll be the talk of two continents." "thank you, mr. gibson, i do not think that i am in need of booming. it may surprise you to know that i prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. but we are wasting time. let us get down to the facts." "i think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports. i don't know that i can add anything which will help you. but if there is anything you would wish more light upon--well, i am here to give it." "well, there is just one point." "what is it?" "what were the exact relations between you and miss dunbar?" the gold king gave a violent start, and half rose from his chair. then his massive calm came back to him. "i suppose you are within your rights--and maybe doing your duty--in asking such a question, mr. holmes." "we will agree to suppose so," said holmes. "then i can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children." holmes rose from his chair. "i am a rather busy man, mr. gibson," said he, "and i have no time or taste for aimless conversations. i wish you good morning." our visitor had risen also and his great loose figure towered above holmes. there was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks. "what the devil do you mean by this, mr. holmes? do you dismiss my case?" "well, mr. gibson, at least i dismiss you. i should have thought my words were plain." "plain enough, but what's at the back of it? raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? i've a right to a plain answer." "well, perhaps you have," said holmes. "i'll give you one. this case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with, without the further difficulty of false information." "meaning that i lie." "well, i was trying to express it as delicately as i could, but if you insist upon the word i will not contradict you." i sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire's face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe. "don't be noisy, mr. gibson. i find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. i suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage." with an effort the gold king mastered his fury. i could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference. "well, it's your choice. i guess you know how to run your own business. i can't make you touch the case against your will. you've done yourself no good this morning, mr. holmes, for i have broken stronger men than you. no man ever crossed me and was the better for it." "so many have said so, and yet here i am," said holmes, smiling. "well, good morning, mr. gibson. you have a good deal yet to learn." our visitor made a noisy exit, but holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling. "any views, watson?" he asked at last. "well, holmes, i must confess that when i consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when i remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man bates plainly told us, it seems to me----" "exactly. and to me also." "but what were his relations with the governess and how did you discover them?" "bluff, watson, bluff! when i considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter, and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. we've got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. you saw the frontal attack which i made upon him and how imperturbably he received it. then i bluffed him by giving him the impression that i was absolutely certain, when in reality i was only extremely suspicious. "perhaps he will come back?" "he is sure to come back. he must come back. he can't leave it where it is. ha! isn't that a ring? yes, there is his footstep. well, mr. gibson, i was just saying to dr. watson that you were somewhat overdue." the gold king had re-entered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. his wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end. "i've been thinking it over, mr. holmes, and i feel that i have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. you are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and i think the more of you for it. i can assure you, however, that the relations between miss dunbar and me don't really touch this case." "that is for me to decide, is it not?" "yes, i guess that is so. you're like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis." "exactly. that expresses it. and it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case." "that may be so, but you will admit, mr. holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with a woman may be--if there is really some serious feeling in the case. i guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don't welcome intruders. and you burst suddenly into it. but the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. well, the stakes are down and the reserve open and you can explore where you will. what is it you want?" "the truth." the gold king paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. his grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave. "i can give it to you in a very few words, mr. holmes," said he at last. "there are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so i won't go deeper than is needful. i met my wife when i was gold-hunting in brazil. maria pinto was the daughter of a government official at manaos, and she was very beautiful. i was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as i look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, i can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. it was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the american women whom i had known. well, to make a long story short, i loved her and i married her. it was only when the romance had passed--and it lingered for years--that i realized that we had nothing--absolutely nothing--in common. my love faded. if hers had faded also it might have been easier. but you know the wonderful way of women! do what i might nothing could turn her from me. if i have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because i knew that if i could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. but nothing changed her. she adored me in those english woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the amazon. do what i might, she was as devoted as ever. "then came miss grace dunbar. she answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. the whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. now, i make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and i will admit to you that i could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. do you blame me, mr. holmes?" "i do not blame you for feeling it. i should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection." "well, maybe so," said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. "i'm not pretending to be any better than i am. i guess all my life i've been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and i never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. i told her so." "oh, you did, did you?" holmes could look very formidable when he was moved. "i said to her that if i could marry her i would, but that it was out of my power. i said that money was no object and that all i could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done." "very generous, i am sure," said holmes, with a sneer. "see here, mr. holmes. i came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. i'm not asking for your criticism." "it is only for the young lady's sake that i touch your case at all," said holmes sternly. "i don't know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences." to my surprise the gold king took the reproof with equanimity. "that's how i feel myself about it now. i thank god that my plans did not work out as i intended. she would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly." "why did she not?" "well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. when i had sworn--as i did--that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. but there was another reason. she knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. she wanted to use it for good." "how?" "well, she knew something of my affairs. they are large, mr. holmes--large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. i can make or break--and it is usually break. it wasn't individuals only. it was communities, cities, even nations. business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. i played the game for all it was worth. i never squealed myself and i never cared if the other fellow squealed. but she saw it different. i guess she was right. she believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. that was how she saw it, and i guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. she found that i listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. so she stayed--and then this came along." "can you throw any light upon that?" the gold king paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought. "it's very black against her. i can't deny that. and women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man. at first i was so rattled and taken aback that i was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. one explanation came into my head. i give it to you, mr. holmes, for what it is worth. there is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. there is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause--and i think she understood this--for the latter, she was aware that this english girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. it was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. she was crazy with hatred, and the heat of the amazon was always in her blood. she might have planned to murder miss dunbar--or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it." "that possibility had already occurred to me," said holmes. "indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder." "but she utterly denies it." "well, that is not final--is it? one can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. she might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. what is against such a supposition?" "miss dunbar herself." "well, perhaps." holmes looked at his watch. "i have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach winchester by the evening train. when i have seen this young lady, it is very possible that i may be of more use to you in the matter, though i cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire." there was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching winchester that day we went down to thor place, the hampshire estate of mr. neil gibson. he did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of sergeant coventry, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. he was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner, which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say. he had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help. "anyhow, i'd rather have you than scotland yard, mr. holmes," said he. "if the yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. now, you play straight, so i've heard." "i need not appear in the matter at all," said holmes, to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. "if i can clear it up i don't ask to have my name mentioned." "well, it's very handsome of you, i am sure. and your friend, dr. watson, can be trusted, i know. now, mr. holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question i should like to ask you. i'd breathe it to no soul but you." he looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words. "don't you think there might be a case against mr. neil gibson himself?" "i have been considering that." "you've not seen miss dunbar. she is a wonderful fine woman in every way. he may well have wished his wife out of the road. and these americans are readier with pistols than our folk are. it was his pistol, you know." "was that clearly made out?" "yes, sir. it was one of a pair that he had." "one of a pair? where is the other?" "well, the gentleman has a lot of fire-arms of one sort and another. we never quite matched that particular pistol--but the box was made for two." "if it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it." "well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over." "later, perhaps. i think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy." this conversation had taken place in the little front room of sergeant coventry's humble cottage which served as the local police-station. a walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the thor place estate. a path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the wide-spread, half-timbered house, half tudor and half georgian, upon the crest of the hill. beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground. "that was where mrs. gibson's body lay. i marked it by that stone." "i understand that you were there before it was moved?" "yes; they sent for me at once." "who did?" "mr. gibson himself. the moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive." "that was sensible. i gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters." "yes, sir, very close." "near the right temple?" "just behind it, sir." "how did the body lie?" "on the back, sir. no trace of a struggle. no marks. no weapon. the short note from miss dunbar was clutched in her left hand." "clutched, you say?" "yes, sir; we could hardly open the fingers." "that is of great importance. it excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. dear me! the note, as i remember, was quite short. 'i will be at thor bridge at nine o'clock.--g. dunbar.' was that not so?" "yes, sir." "did miss dunbar admit writing it?" "yes, sir." "what was her explanation?" "her defence was reserved for the assizes. she would say nothing." "the problem is certainly a very interesting one. the point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?" "well, sir," said the guide, "it seemed, if i may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case." holmes shook his head. "granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before--say one hour or two. why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? why should she carry it so carefully? she did not need to refer to it in the interview. does it not seem remarkable?" "well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does." "i think i should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out." he seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and i could see his quick grey eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework. "this is curious," said he. "yes, sir; we saw the chip on the ledge. i expect it's been done by some passer-by." the stonework was grey, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. when examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow. "it took some violence to do that," said holmes thoughtfully. with his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. "yes, it was a hard knock. in a curious place, too. it was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the _lower_ edge of the parapet." "but it is at least fifteen feet from the body." "yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. it may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth noting. i do not think that we have anything more to learn here. there were no footsteps, you say?" "the ground was iron hard, sir. there were no traces at all." "then we can go. we will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. then we shall get on to winchester, for i should desire to see miss dunbar before we go farther." mr. neil gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic mr. bates who had called upon us in the morning. he showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of fire-arms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life. "mr. gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods," said he. "he sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. he is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. i am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified." "did you ever witness physical violence towards her?" "no, i cannot say that. but i have heard words which were nearly as bad--words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants." "our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life," remarked holmes, as we made our way to the station. "well, watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet i seem some way from my conclusion. in spite of the very evident dislike which mr. bates has to his employer, i gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. dinner was over at eight-thirty and all was normal up to then. it is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. there is no evidence at all that mr. gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o'clock. on the other hand, miss dunbar, as i understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet mrs. gibson at the bridge. beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence. we have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. i must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing." "and what is that, holmes?" "the finding of the pistol in her wardrobe." "dear me, holmes!" i cried, "that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all." "not so, watson. it had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that i am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. we must look for consistency. where there is a want of it we must suspect deception." "i hardly follow you." "well now, watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. you have planned it. a note has been written. the victim has come. you have your weapon. the crime is done. it has been workman-like and complete. do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would for ever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, watson, and yet i could not picture you doing anything so crude as that." "in the excitement of the moment----" "no, no, watson, i will not admit that it is possible. where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. i hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception." "but there is so much to explain." "well, we shall set about explaining it. when once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. for example, there is this revolver. miss dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. on our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. who placed it there? someone who wished to incriminate her. was not that person the actual criminal? you see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry." we were compelled to spend the night at winchester, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of mr. joyce cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. i had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but i can never forget the effect which miss dunbar produced upon me. it was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself--something which could control and guide him. one felt, too, as one looked at that strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. she was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them the appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. now, as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us. "perhaps mr. neil gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?" she asked, in a low, agitated voice. "yes," holmes answered; "you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. after seeing you, i am prepared to accept mr. gibson's statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. but why was the whole situation not brought out in court?" "it seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. i thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. but i understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious." "my dear young lady," cried holmes earnestly, "i beg you to have no illusions upon the point. mr. cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. it would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth." "i will conceal nothing." "tell us, then, of your true relations with mr. gibson's wife." "she hated me, mr. holmes. she hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. she was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. it is probable that she misunderstood our relations. i would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. i can see now that i was wrong. nothing could justify me in remaining where i was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if i had left the house." "now, miss dunbar," said holmes, "i beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening." "i can tell you the truth so far as i know it, mr. holmes, but i am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points--the most vital points--which i can neither explain nor can i imagine any explanation." "if you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation." "with regard, then, to my presence at thor bridge that night, i received a note from mrs. gibson in the morning. it lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. it implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. i saw no reason for such secrecy, but i did as she asked, accepting the appointment. she asked me to destroy her note and i burned it in the schoolroom grate. she was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which i frequently reproached him, and i could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview." "yet she kept your reply very carefully?" "yes. i was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died." "well, what happened then?" "i went down as i had promised. when i reached the bridge she was waiting for me. never did i realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me. she was like a mad woman--indeed, i think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. how else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? i will not say what she said. she poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. i did not even answer--i could not. it was dreadful to see her. i put my hands to my ears and rushed away. when i left her she was standing still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge." "where she was afterwards found?" "within a few yards from the spot." "and yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?" "no, i heard nothing. but, indeed, mr. holmes, i was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that i rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and i was incapable of noticing anything which happened." "you say that you returned to your room. did you leave it again before next morning?" "yes; when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death i ran out with the others." "did you see mr. gibson?" "yes; he had just returned from the bridge when i saw him. he had sent for the doctor and the police." "did he seem to you much perturbed?" "mr. gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. i do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. but i, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned." "then we come to the all-important point. this pistol that was found in your room. had you ever seen it before?" "never, i swear it." "when was it found?" "next morning, when the police made their search." "among your clothes?" "yes; on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses." "you could not guess how long it had been there?" "it had not been there the morning before." "how do you know?" "because i tidied out the wardrobe." "that is final. then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you." "it must have been so." "and when?" "it could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when i would be in the schoolroom with the children." "as you were when you got the note?" "yes; from that time onwards for the whole morning." "thank you, miss dunbar. is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?" "i can think of none." "there was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge--a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. could you suggest any possible explanation of that?" "surely it must be a mere coincidence." "curious, miss dunbar, very curious. why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy and why at the very place?" "but what could have caused it? only great violence could have such an effect." holmes did not answer. his pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away expression which i had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. so evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action. "come, watson, come!" he cried. "what is it, mr. holmes?" "never mind, my dear lady. you will hear from me, mr. cummings. with the help of the god of justice i will give you a case which will make england ring. you will get news by to-morrow, miss dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that i have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through." it was not a long journey from winchester to thor place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for holmes it was evident that it seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him. suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me--we had a first-class carriage to ourselves--and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods. "watson," said he, "i have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours." it was as well for him that i did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem, so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. i reminded him of the fact. "yes, yes, i am a little absent-minded in such matters. but have you your revolver on you?" i produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. he undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care. "it's heavy--remarkably heavy," said he. "yes, it is a solid bit of work." he mused over it for a minute. "do you know, watson," said he, "i believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating." "my dear holmes, you are joking." "no, watson, i am very serious. there is a test before us. if the test comes off, all will be clear. and the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. one cartridge out. now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. so! that increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction." i had no glimmer of what was in his mind nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little hampshire station. we secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant. "a clue, mr. holmes? what is it?" "it all depends upon the behaviour of dr. watson's revolver," said my friend. "here it is. now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?" the village shop provided a ball of stout twine. "i think that this is all we will need," said holmes. "now, if you please, we will get off on what i hope is the last stage of our journey." the sun was setting and turning the rolling hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. the sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. as we approached the scene of the crime i could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated. "yes," he said, in answer to my remark, "you have seen me miss my mark before, watson. i have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. it seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at winchester, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. and yet--and yet---- well, watson, we can but try." as he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. we had now reached the scene of the tragedy. with great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. he then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. this he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. he then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side. "now for it!" he cried. at the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. in an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. it had hardly gone before holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected. "was there ever a more exact demonstration?" he cried. "see, watson, your revolver has solved the problem!" as he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade. "we'll stay at the inn to-night," he continued, as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. "you will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend's revolver. you will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. you can let mr. gibson know that i will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for miss dunbar's vindication." late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed. "i fear, watson," said he, "that you will not improve any reputation which i may have acquired by adding the case of the thor bridge mystery to your annals. i have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. i confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that i blame myself for not having attained it sooner. "it must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman's mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. i do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. whether miss dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. no doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. her first resolution was to end her own life. her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be. "we can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. a note was extracted very cleverly from miss dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. in her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it, by holding it in her hand to the last. this alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did. "then she took one of her husband's revolvers--there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house--and kept it for her own use. a similar one she concealed that morning in miss dunbar's wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. she then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. when miss dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. the papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. well, watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that mr. neil gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught." viii the adventure of the creeping man mr. sherlock holmes was always of opinion that i should publish the singular facts connected with professor presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the university and were echoed in the learned societies of london. there were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend's adventures. now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by holmes before his retirement from practice. even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public. it was one sunday evening early in september of the year 1903 that i received one of holmes's laconic messages: "come at once if convenient--if inconvenient come all the same.--s.h." the relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. he was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and i had become one of them. as an institution i was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. when it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my role was obvious. but apart from this i had uses. i was a whetstone for his mind. i stimulated him. he liked to think aloud in my presence. his remarks could hardly be said to be made to me--many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead--but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that i should register and interject. if i irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. such was my humble role in our alliance. when i arrived at baker street i found him huddled up in his arm-chair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. it was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. with a wave of his hand he indicated my old arm-chair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and, with his usual whimsical smile, he greeted me back to what had once been my home. "you will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear watson," said he. "some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. i have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective." "but surely, holmes, this has been explored," said i. "bloodhounds--sleuth-hounds----" "no, no, watson; that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. but there is another which is far more subtle. you may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the copper beeches, i was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father." "yes, i remember it well." "my line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. a dog reflects the family life. whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. and their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others." i shook my head. "surely, holmes, this is a little far-fetched," said i. he had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment. "the practical application of what i have said is very close to the problem which i am investigating. it is a tangled skein, you understand, and i am looking for a loose end. one possible loose end lies in the question: why does professor presbury's faithful wolf-hound, roy, endeavour to bite him?" i sank back in my chair in some disappointment. was it for so trivial a question as this that i had been summoned from my work? holmes glanced across at me. "the same old watson!" said he. "you never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. but is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher--you've heard of presbury, of course, the famous camford physiologist?--that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolf-hound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? what do you make of it?" "the dog is ill." "well, that has to be considered. but he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. curious, watson--very curious. but young mr. bennett is before his time, if that is his ring. i had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came." there was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door, and a moment later the new client presented himself. he was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the self-possession of the man of the world. he shook hands with holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me. "this matter is very delicate, mr. holmes," he said. "consider the relation in which i stand to professor presbury, both privately and publicly. i really can hardly justify myself if i speak before any third person." "have no fear, mr. bennett. dr. watson is the very soul of discretion, and i can assure you that this is a matter in which i am very likely to need an assistant." "as you like, mr. holmes. you will, i am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter." "you will appreciate it, watson, when i tell you that this gentleman, mr. trevor bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. but it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery." "i hope so, mr. holmes. that is my one object. does dr. watson know the situation?" "i have not had time to explain it." "then perhaps i had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments." "i will do so myself," said holmes, "in order to show that i have the events in their due order. the professor, watson, is a man of european reputation. his life has been academic. there has never been a breath of scandal. he is a widower with one daughter, edith. he is, i gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. so the matter stood until a very few months ago. "then the current of his life was broken. he is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of professor morphy, his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy. it was not, as i understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man, but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. the lady, alice morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the professor's infatuation. nonetheless, it did not meet with full approval in his own family." "we thought it rather excessive," said our visitor. "exactly. excessive and a little violent and unnatural. professor presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. the daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. the girl seemed to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. it was only age which stood in the way. "about this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the professor's life. he did what he had never done before. he left home and gave no indication where he was going. he was away a fortnight, and returned looking rather travel-worn. he made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. it chanced, however, that our client here, mr. bennett, received a letter from a fellow-student in prague, who said that he was glad to have seen professor presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. only in this way did his own household learn where he had been. "now comes the point. from that time onwards a curious change came over the professor. he became furtive and sly. those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. his intellect was not affected. his lectures were as brilliant as ever. but always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. his daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. you, sir, as i understand, did the same--but all was in vain. and now, mr. bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters." "you must understand, dr. watson, that the professor had no secrets from me. if i were his son or his younger brother, i could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. as his secretary i handled every paper which came to him, and i opened and subdivided his letters. shortly after his return all this was changed. he told me that certain letters might come to him from london which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. these were to be set aside for his own eyes only. i may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the e.c. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. if he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected." "and the box," said holmes. "ah, yes, the box. the professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. it was the one thing which suggested a continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with germany. this he placed in his instrument cupboard. one day, in looking for a cannula, i took up the box. to my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. it was the first time such a thing had happened and i was deeply hurt. i endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that i had touched the box, but all the evening i was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind." mr. bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. "that was on july 2," said he. "you are certainly an admirable witness," said holmes. "i may need some of these dates which you have noted." "i learned method among other things from my great teacher. from the time that i observed abnormality in his behaviour i felt that it was my duty to study his case. thus i have it here that it was on that very day, july 2, that roy attacked the professor, as he came from his study into the hall. again on july 11, there was a scene of the same sort and then i have a note of yet another upon july 20. after that we had to banish roy to the stables. he was a dear, affectionate animal--but i fear i weary you." mr. bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that holmes was not listening. his face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. with an effort he recovered himself. "singular! most singular!" he murmured. "these details were new to me, mr. bennett. i think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? but you spoke of some fresh developments." the pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. "what i speak of occurred the night before last," said he. "i was lying awake about two in the morning, when i was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. i opened my door and peeped out. i should explain that the professor sleeps at the end of the passage----" "the date being----?" asked holmes. our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption. "i have said, sir, that it was the night before last--that is, september 4." holmes nodded and smiled. "pray continue," said he. "he sleeps at the end of the passage, and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. it was a really terrifying experience, mr. holmes. i think that i am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but i was shaken by what i saw. the passage was dark save that one window half-way along it threw a patch of light. i could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. then suddenly it emerged into the light, and i saw that it was he. he was crawling, mr. holmes--crawling! he was not quite on his hands and knees. i should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. yet he seemed to move with ease. i was so paralysed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that i was able to step forward and ask if i could assist him. his answer was extraordinary. he sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. i waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. it must have been daylight before he regained his room." "well, watson, what make you of that?" asked holmes, with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen. "lumbago, possibly. i have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper." "good, watson! you always keep us flat-footed on the ground. but we can hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment." "he was never better in health," said bennett. "in fact, he is stronger than i have known him for years. but there are the facts, mr. holmes. it is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wits' end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. edith--miss presbury--feels as i do, that we cannot wait passively any longer." "it is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. what do you think, watson?" "speaking as a medical man," said i, "it appears to be a case for an alienist. the old gentleman's cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair. he made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. his letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction--a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box." "and the wolf-hound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. no, no, watson, there is more in it than this. now, i can only suggest----" what sherlock holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at this moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room. as she appeared mr. bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched. "edith, dear! nothing the matter, i hope?" "i felt i must follow you. oh, jack, i have been so dreadfully frightened! it is awful to be there alone." "mr. holmes, this is the young lady i spoke of. this is my fiancée." "we were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, watson?" holmes answered, with a smile. "i take it, miss presbury, that there is some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should know?" our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional english type, smiled back at holmes as she seated herself beside mr. bennett. "when i found mr. bennett had left his hotel i thought i should probably find him here. of course, he had told me that he would consult you. but, oh, mr. holmes, can you do nothing for my poor father?" "i have hopes, miss presbury, but the case is still obscure. perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it." "it was last night, mr. holmes. he had been very strange all day. i am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does. he lives as in a strange dream. yesterday was such a day. it was not my father with whom i lived. his outward shell was there, but it was not really he." "tell me what happened." "i was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously. poor roy, he is chained now near the stable. i may say that i always sleep with my door locked; for, as jack--as mr. bennett--will tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. my room is on the second floor. it happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was bright moonlight outside. as i lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, i was amazed to see my father's face looking in at me. mr. holmes, i nearly died of surprise and horror. there it was pressed against the window-pane, and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window. if that window had opened, i think i should have gone mad. it was no delusion, mr. holmes. don't deceive yourself by thinking so. i dare say it was twenty seconds or so that i lay paralysed and watched the face. then it vanished, but i could not--i could not spring out of bed and look out after it. i lay cold and shivering till morning. at breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure of the night. neither did i, but i gave an excuse for coming to town--and here i am." holmes looked thoroughly surprised at miss presbury's narrative. "my dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor. is there a long ladder in the garden?" "no, mr. holmes; that is the amazing part of it. there is no possible way of reaching the window--and yet he was there." "the date being september 5," said holmes. "that certainly complicates matters." it was the young lady's turn to look surprised. "this is the second time that you have alluded to the date, mr. holmes," said bennett. "is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case?" "it is possible--very possible--and yet i have not my full material at present." "possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon?" "no, i assure you. it was quite a different line of thought. possibly you can leave your notebook with me and i will check the dates. now i think, watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear. this young lady has informed us--and i have the greatest confidence in her intuition--that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates. we will therefore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date. he will put it down to his own lack of memory. thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him." "that is excellent," said mr. bennett. "i warn you, however, that the professor is irascible and violent at times." holmes smiled. "there are reasons why we should come at once--very cogent reasons if my theories hold good. to-morrow, mr. bennett, will certainly see us in camford. there is, if i remember right, an inn called the 'chequers' where the port used to be above mediocrity, and the linen was above reproach. i think, watson, that our lot for the next few days might lie in less pleasant places." monday morning found us on our way to the famous university town--an easy effort on the part of holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one which involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice was by this time not inconsiderable. holmes made no allusion to the case until after we had deposited our suit-cases at the ancient hostel of which he had spoken. "i think, watson, that we can catch the professor just before lunch. he lectures at eleven, and should have an interval at home." "what possible excuse have we for calling?" holmes glanced at his notebook. "there was a period of excitement upon august 26. we will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times. if we insist that we are there by appointment i think he will hardly venture to contradict us. have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?" "we can but try." "excellent, watson! compound of the busy bee and excelsior. we can but try--the motto of the firm. a friendly native will surely guide us." such a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient colleges, and finally turning into a tree-lined drive pulled up at the door of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple wistaria. professor presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not only of comfort but of luxury. even as we pulled up a grizzled head appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn glasses. a moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from london, was standing before us. there was certainly no sign of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, large-featured man, grave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a lecturer needs. his eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to the verge of cunning. he looked at our cards. "pray sit down, gentlemen. what can i do for you?" mr. holmes smiled amiably. "it was the question which i was about to put to you, professor." "to me, sir!" "possibly there is some mistake. i heard through a second person that professor presbury of camford had need of my services." "oh, indeed!" it seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in the intense grey eyes. "you heard that, did you? may i ask the name of your informant?" "i am sorry, professor, but the matter was rather confidential. if i have made a mistake there is no harm done. i can only express my regret." "not at all. i should wish to go further into this matter. it interests me. have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your assertion?" "no, i have not." "i presume that you do not go so far as to assert that i summoned you?" "i would rather answer no questions," said holmes. "no, i dare say not," said the professor, with asperity. "however, that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid." he walked across the room to the bell. our london friend, mr. bennett, answered the call. "come in, mr. bennett. these two gentlemen have come from london under the impression that they have been summoned. you handle all my correspondence. have you a note of anything going to a person named holmes?" "no, sir," bennett answered, with a flush. "that is conclusive," said the professor, glaring angrily at my companion. "now, sir"--he leaned forward with his two hands upon the table--"it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one." holmes shrugged his shoulders. "i can only repeat that i am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion." "hardly enough, mr. holmes!" the old man cried, in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face. he got between us and the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious passion. "you can hardly get out of it so easily as that." his face was convulsed and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage. i am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room if mr. bennett had not intervened. "my dear professor," he cried, "consider your position! consider the scandal at the university! mr. holmes is a well-known man. you cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy." sulkily our host--if i may call him so--cleared the path to the door. we were glad to find ourselves outside the house, and in the quiet of the tree-lined drive. holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode. "our learned friend's nerves are somewhat out of order," said he. "perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that personal contact which i desired. but, dear me, watson, he is surely at our heels. the villain still pursues us." there were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief, not the formidable professor but his assistant who appeared round the curve of the drive. he came panting up to us. "i am so sorry, mr. holmes. i wished to apologize." "my dear sir, there is no need. it is all in the way of professional experience." "i have never seen him in a more dangerous mood. but he grows more sinister. you can understand now why his daughter and i are alarmed. and yet his mind is perfectly clear." "too clear!" said holmes. "that was my miscalculation. it is evident that his memory is much more reliable than i had thought. by the way, can we, before we go, see the window of miss presbury's room?" mr. bennett pushed his way through some shrubs and we had a view of the side of the house. "it is there. the second on the left." "dear me, it seems hardly accessible. and yet you will observe that there is a creeper below and a water-pipe above which give some foothold." "i could not climb it myself," said mr. bennett. "very likely. it would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man." "there was one other thing i wished to tell you, mr. holmes. i have the address of the man in london to whom the professor writes. he seems to have written this morning and i got it from his blotting-paper. it is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but what else can i do?" holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket. "dorak--a curious name. slavonic, i imagine. well, it is an important link in the chain. we return to london this afternoon, mr. bennett. i see no good purpose to be served by our remaining. we cannot arrest the professor, because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad. no action is as yet possible." "then what on earth are we to do?" "a little patience, mr. bennett. things will soon develop. unless i am mistaken next tuesday may mark a crisis. certainly we shall be in camford on that day. meanwhile, the general position is undeniably unpleasant, and if miss presbury can prolong her visit----" "that is easy." "then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past. meanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him. so long as he is in a good humour all is well." "there he is!" said bennett, in a startled whisper. looking between the branches we saw the tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door and look around him. he stood leaning forward, his hands swinging straight before him, his head turning from side to side. the secretary with a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed to be animated and even excited conversation. "i expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together," said holmes, as we walked hotelwards. "he struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain, from the little i saw of him. explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it. i rather fancy that friend bennett is in for an uncomfortable time." holmes stopped at a post office and sent off a telegram on our way. the answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me. "have visited the commercial road and seen dorak. suave person, bohemian, elderly. keeps large general store.--mercer." "mercer is since your time," said holmes. "he is my general utility man who looks up routine business. it was important to know something of the man with whom our professor was so secretly corresponding. his nationality connects up with the prague visit." "thank goodness that something connects with something," said i. "at present we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents with no bearing upon each other. for example, what possible connection can there be between an angry wolf-hound and a visit to bohemia, or either of them with a man crawling down a passage at night? as to your dates, that is the biggest mystification of all." holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. we were, i may say, seated in the old sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vintage of which holmes had spoken on the table between us. "well, now, let us take the dates first," said he, his finger-tips together and his manner as if he were addressing a class. "this excellent young man's diary shows that there was trouble upon july 2, and from then onwards it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as i remember, only one exception. thus the last outbreak upon friday was on september 3, which also falls into the series, as did august 26, which preceded it. the thing is beyond coincidence." i was forced to agree. "let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect. his naturally violent nature is intensified by it. he learned to take this drug while he was in prague, and is now supplied with it by a bohemian intermediary in london. this all hangs together, watson!" "but the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?" "well, well, we have made a beginning. i should not expect any fresh developments until next tuesday. in the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend bennett and enjoy the amenities of this charming town." in the morning mr. bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report. as holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him. without exactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the professor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some strong grievance. this morning he was quite himself again, however, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded class. "apart from his queer fits," said bennett, "he has actually more energy and vitality than i can ever remember, nor was his brain ever clearer. but it's not he--it's never the man whom we have known." "i don't think you have anything to fear now for a week at least," holmes answered. "i am a busy man, and dr. watson has his patients to attend to. let us agree that we meet here at this hour next tuesday, and i shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles. meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs." i saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following monday evening i had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the train. from what he told me as we travelled up to camford all was well, the peace of the professor's house had been unruffled, and his own conduct perfectly normal. this also was the report which was given us by mr. bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our old quarters in the "chequers." "he heard from his london correspondent to-day. there was a letter and there was a small packet, each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them. there has been nothing else." "that may prove quite enough," said holmes grimly. "now, mr. bennett, we shall, i think, come to some conclusion to-night. if my deductions are correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a head. in order to do so it is necessary to hold the professor under observation. i would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on the look out. should you hear him pass your door do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly as you can. dr. watson and i will not be far off. by the way, where is the key of that little box of which you spoke?" "upon his watch-chain." "i fancy our researches must lie in that direction. at the worst the lock should not be very formidable. have you any other able-bodied man on the premises?" "there is the coachman, macphail." "where does he sleep?" "over the stables." "we might possibly want him. well, we can do no more until we see how things develop. good-bye--but i expect that we shall see you before morning." it was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes immediately opposite the hall door of the professor. it was a fine night, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. there was a breeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to time the half-moon. it would have been a dismal vigil were it not for the expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the assurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the strange sequence of events which had engaged our attention. "if the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the professor at his worst to-night," said holmes. "the fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to prague, that he is in secret correspondence with a bohemian dealer in london, who presumably represents someone in prague, and that he received a packet from him this very day, all point in one direction. what he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way from prague is clear enough. he takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which attracted my attention. but his symptoms are most remarkable. did you observe his knuckles?" i had to confess that i did not. "thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience. always look at the hands first, watson. then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. very curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of progression observed by----" holmes paused, and suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead. "oh, watson, watson, what a fool i have been! it seems incredible, and yet it must be true. all points in one direction. how could i miss seeing the connection of ideas? those knuckles--how could i have passed those knuckles? and the dog! and the ivy! it's surely time that i disappeared into that little farm of my dreams. look out, watson! here he is! we shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves." the hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamp-lit background we saw the tall figure of professor presbury. he was clad in his dressing-gown. as he stood outlined in the doorway he was erect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last. now he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came over him. he sank down into a crouching position, and moved along upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were overflowing with energy and vitality. he moved along the face of the house and then round the corner. as he disappeared bennett slipped through the hall door and softly followed him. "come, watson, come!" cried holmes, and we stole as softly as we could through the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the other side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the half-moon. the professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-covered wall. as we watched him he suddenly began with incredible agility to ascend it. from branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own powers, with no definite object in view. with his dressing-gown flapping on each side of him he looked like some huge bat glued against the side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit wall. presently he tired of this amusement, and, dropping from branch to branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the stables, creeping along in the same strange way as before. the wolf-hound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever when it actually caught sight of its master. it was straining on its chain, and quivering with eagerness and rage. the professor squatted down very deliberately just out of reach of the hound, and began to provoke it in every possible way. he took handfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in the dog's face, prodded him with a stick which he had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal's fury, which was already beyond all control. in all our adventures i do not know that i have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive and still dignified figure crouching frog-like upon the ground and goading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which ramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated cruelty. and then in a moment it happened! it was not the chain that broke, but it was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked newfoundland. we heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next instant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one roaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of terror. it was a very narrow thing for the professor's life. the savage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two apart. it might have been a dangerous task for us, but bennett's voice and presence brought the great wolf-hound instantly to reason. the uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room above the stables. "i'm not surprised," said he, shaking his head. "i've seen him at it before. i knew the dog would get him sooner or later." the hound was secured, and together we carried the professor up to his room, where bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his torn throat. the sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid artery, and the hemorrhage was serious. in half an hour the danger was past, i had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk into deep sleep. then, and only then, were we able to look at each other and to take stock of the situation. "i think a first-class surgeon should see him," said i. "for god's sake, no!" cried bennett. "at present the scandal is confined to our own household. it is safe with us. if it gets beyond these walls it will never stop. consider his position at the university, his european reputation, the feelings of his daughter." "quite so," said holmes. "i think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand. the key from the watch-chain, mr. bennett. macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change. let us see what we can find in the professor's mysterious box." there was not much, but there was enough--an empty phial, another nearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed, foreign hand. the marks on the envelopes showed that they were those which had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated from the commercial road and signed "a. dorak." they were mere invoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to professor presbury, or receipts to acknowledge money. there was one other envelope, however, in a more educated hand and bearing the austrian stamp with the postmark of prague. "here we have our material!" cried holmes, as he tore out the enclosure. "honoured colleague," it ran. "since your esteemed visit i have thought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are some special reasons for the treatment, i would none the less enjoin caution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a kind. "it is possible that the serum of anthropoid would have been better. i have, as i explained to you, used black-faced langur because a specimen was accessible. langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while anthropoid walks erect, and is in all ways nearer. "i beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature revelation of the process. i have one other client in england, and dorak is my agent for both. "weekly reports will oblige. "yours with high esteem, "h. lowenstein." lowenstein! the name brought back to me the memory of some snippet from a newspaper which spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving in some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of life. lowenstein of prague! lowenstein with the wondrous strength-giving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to reveal its source. in a few words i said what i remembered. bennett had taken a manual of zoology from the shelves. "'langur,'" he read, "'the great black-faced monkey of the himalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climbing monkeys.' many details are added. well, thanks to you, mr. holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source." "the real source," said holmes, "lies, of course, in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man. when one tries to rise above nature one is liable to fall below it. the highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny." he sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand, looking at the clear liquid within. "when i have written to this man and told him that i hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he circulates, we will have no more trouble. but it may recur. others may find a better way. there is danger there--a very real danger to humanity. consider, watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. the spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. it would be the survival of the least fit. what sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?" suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and holmes, the man of action, sprang from his chair. "i think there is nothing more to be said, mr. bennett. the various incidents will now fit themselves easily into the general scheme. the dog, of course, was aware of the change far more quickly than you. his smell would ensure that. it was the monkey, not the professor, whom roy attacked, just as it was the monkey who teased roy. climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was a mere chance, i take it, that the pastime brought him to the young lady's window. there is an early train to town, watson, but i think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the 'chequers' before we catch it." ix the adventure of the lion's mane it is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as abstruse and unusual as any which i have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement; and be brought, as it were, to my very door. it occurred after my withdrawal to my little sussex home, when i had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of nature for which i had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of london. at this period of my life the good watson had passed almost beyond my ken. an occasional week-end visit was the most that i ever saw of him. thus i must act as my own chronicler. ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty! as it is, however, i must needs tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as i searched for the mystery of the lion's mane. my villa is situated upon the southern slope of the downs, commanding a great view of the channel. at this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery. at the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full. here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow. this admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point where the little cove and village of fulworth break the line. my house is lonely. i, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. half a mile off, however, is harold stackhurst's well-known coaching establishment. the gables, quite a large place, which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions, with a staff of several masters. stackhurst himself was a well-known rowing blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar. he and i were always friendly from the day i came to the coast, and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation. towards the end of july, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind blowing up-channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs, and leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide. on the morning of which i speak the wind had abated, and all nature was newly washed and fresh. it was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and i strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. i walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. as i walked i heard a shout behind me, and there was harold stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting. "what a morning, mr. holmes! i thought i should see you out." "going for a swim, i see." "at your old tricks again," he laughed, patting his bulging pocket. "yes. mcpherson started early, and i expect i may find him there." fitzroy mcpherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever. he was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him. summer and winter he went for his swim, and, as i am a swimmer myself, i have often joined him. at this moment we saw the man himself. his head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends. then his whole figure appeared at the top, staggering like a drunken man. the next instant he threw up his hands, and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face. stackhurst and i rushed forward--it may have been fifty yards--and turned him on his back. he was obviously dying. those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else. one glimmer of life came into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning. they were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were "the lion's mane." it was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and yet i could twist the sound into no other sense. then he half raised himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air and fell forward on his side. he was dead. my companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but i, as may well be imagined, had every sense on the alert. and i had need, for it was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary case. the man was dressed only in his burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes. as he fell over, his burberry, which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. we stared at it in amazement. his back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. the instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his shoulders and ribs. there was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony. his drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been. i was kneeling and stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell across us, and we found that ian murdoch was by our side. murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend. he seemed to live in some high, abstract region of surds and conic sections with little to connect him with ordinary life. he was looked upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face, but also in occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as ferocious. on one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to mcpherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the plate-glass window, an action for which stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher. such was the strange, complex man who now appeared beside us. he seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself. "poor fellow! poor fellow! what can i do? how can i help?" "were you with him? can you tell us what has happened?" "no, no, i was late this morning. i was not on the beach at all. i have come straight from the gables. what can i do?" "you can hurry to the police-station at fulworth. report the matter at once." without a word he made off at top speed, and i proceeded to take the matter in hand, while stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body. my first task naturally was to note who was on the beach. from the top of the path i could see the whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of fulworth. having satisfied myself upon this point, i walked slowly down the path. there was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there i saw the same footstep, both ascending and descending. no one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning. at one place i observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline. this could only mean that poor mcpherson had fallen as he ascended. there were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once. at the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide. at the side of it mcpherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock. it was folded and dry, so that it would seem that after all he had never entered the water. once or twice as i hunted round amid the hard shingle i came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen. the latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so. and here was the problem clearly defined--as strange a one as had ever confronted me. the man had not been on the beach more than a quarter of an hour at the most. stackhurst had followed him from the gables, so there could be no doubt about that. he had gone to bathe and had stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again--they were all dishevelled and unfastened--and he had returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself. and the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die. who had done this barbarous deed? there were, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment. then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach. they seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon in which mcpherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them, lapping up to the rocks. on the sea two or three fishing-boats were at no great distance. their occupants might be examined at our leisure. there were several roads for inquiry, but none which led to any very obvious goal. when i at last returned to the body i found that a little group of wandering folk had gathered round it. stackhurst was, of course, still there, and ian murdoch had just arrived with anderson, the village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid sussex breed--a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior. he listened to everything, took note of all we said, and finally drew me aside. "i'd be glad of your advice, mr. holmes. this is a big thing for me to handle, and i'll hear of it from lewes if i go wrong." i advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor; also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made, until they came. in the meantime i searched the dead man's pockets. there were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small folding card-case. from this projected a slip of paper, which i unfolded and handed to the constable. there was written on it in a scrawling, feminine hand: "i will be there, you may be sure.--maudie." it read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were a blank. the constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the burberry. then, as nothing more suggested itself, i walked back to my house for breakfast, having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched. stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to the gables, where the inquest would be held. he brought with him some serious and definite news. as i expected, nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in mcpherson's desk, and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with a certain miss maud bellamy, of fulworth. we had then established the identity of the writer of the note. "the police have the letters," he explained. "i could not bring them. but there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair. i see no reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save, indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him." "but hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of using," i remarked. "it is mere chance," said he, "that several of the students were not with mcpherson." "was it mere chance?" stackhurst knit his brows in thought. "ian murdoch held them back," said he; "he would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast. poor chap, he is dreadfully cut up about it all." "and yet i gather that they were not friends." "at one time they were not. but for a year or more murdoch has been as near to mcpherson as he ever could be to anyone. he is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature." "so i understand. i seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog." "that blew over all right." "but left some vindictive feeling, perhaps." "no, no; i am sure they were real friends." "well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. do you know her?" "everyone knows her. she is the beauty of the neighbourhood--a real beauty, holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. i knew that mcpherson was attracted by her, but i had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate." "but who is she?" "she is the daughter of old tom bellamy, who owns all the boats and bathing-cots at fulworth. he was a fisherman to start with, but is now a man of some substance. he and his son william run the business." "shall we walk into fulworth and see them?" "on what pretext?" "oh, we can easily find a pretext. after all, this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outrageous way. some human hand was on the handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries. his circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited. let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal." it would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed. the village of fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the bay. behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been built upon the rising ground. it was to one of these that stackhurst guided me. "that's the haven, as bellamy called it. the one with the corner tower and slate roof. not bad for a man who started with nothing but---- by jove, look at that!" the garden gate of the haven had opened and a man had emerged. there was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure. it was ian murdoch, the mathematician. a moment later we confronted him upon the road. "hullo!" said stackhurst. the man nodded, gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal pulled him up. "what were you doing there?" he asked. murdoch's face flushed with anger. "i am your subordinate, sir, under your roof. i am not aware that i owe you any account of my private actions." stackhurst's nerves were near the surface after all he had endured. otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited. now he lost his temper completely. "in the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, mr. murdoch." "your own question might perhaps come under the same heading." "this is not the first time that i have had to overlook your insubordinate ways. it will certainly be the last. you will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can." "i had intended to do so. i have lost to-day the only person who made the gables habitable." he strode off upon his way, while stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. "is he not an impossible, intolerable man?" he cried. the one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that mr. ian murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from the scene of the crime. suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in my mind. perhaps the visit to the bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter. stackhurst pulled himself together and we went forward to the house. mr. bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard. he seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid as his hair. "no, sir, i do not desire any particulars. my son here"--indicating a powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-room--"is of one mind with me that mr. mcpherson's attentions to maud were insulting. yes, sir, the word 'marriage' was never mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal more of which neither of us could approve. she has no mother, and we are her only guardians. we are determined----" but the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself. there was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world. who could have imagined that so rare a flower would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere? women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, but i could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed. such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in front of harold stackhurst. "i know already that fitzroy is dead," she said. "do not be afraid to tell me the particulars." "this other gentleman of yours let us know the news," explained the father. "there is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter," growled the younger man. the sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him. "this is my business, william. kindly leave me to manage it in my own way. by all accounts there has been a crime committed. if i can help to show who did it, it is the least i can do for him who is gone." she listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty. maud bellamy will always remain in my memory as a most complete and remarkable woman. it seems that she already knew me by sight, for she turned to me at the end. "bring them to justice, mr. holmes. you have my sympathy and my help, whoever they may be." it seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke. "thank you," said i. "i value a woman's instinct in such matters. you use the word 'they.' you think that more than one was concerned?" "i knew mr. mcpherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man. no single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him." "might i have one word with you alone?" "i tell you, maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter," cried her father angrily. she looked at me helplessly. "what can i do?" "the whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm if i discuss them here," said i. "i should have preferred privacy, but if your father will not allow it, he must share the deliberations." then i spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man's pocket. "it is sure to be produced at the inquest. may i ask you to throw any light upon it that you can?" "i see no reason for mystery," she answered. "we were engaged to be married, and we only kept it secret because fitzroy's uncle, who is very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish. there was no other reason." "you could have told us," growled mr. bellamy. "so i would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy." "i object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station." "it was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you. as to this appointment"--she fumbled in her dress and produced a crumpled note--"it was in answer to this." "dearest," ran the message: "the old place on the beach just after sunset on tuesday. it is the only time i can get away.--f.m." "tuesday was to-day, and i had meant to meet him to-night." i turned over the paper. "this never came by post. how did you get it?" "i would rather not answer that question. it has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating. but anything which bears upon that i will most freely answer." she was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation. she had no reason to think that her fiancé had any hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers. "may i ask if mr. ian murdoch was one of them?" she blushed and seemed confused. "there was a time when i thought he was. but that was all changed when he understood the relations between fitzroy and myself." again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape. his record must be examined. his rooms must be privately searched. stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were forming. we returned from our visit to the haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands. a week passed. the inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adjourned for further evidence. stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search of his room, but without result. personally, i had gone over the whole ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new conclusions. in all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers. even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery. and then there came the incident of the dog. it was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the country-side. "sad story this, sir, about mr. mcpherson's dog," said she one evening. i do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my attention. "what of mr. mcpherson's dog?" "dead, sir. died of grief for its master." "who told you this?" "why, sir, everyone is talking of it. it took on terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. then to-day two of the young gentlemen from the gables found it dead--down on the beach, sir, at the very place where its master met his end." "at the very place." the words stood out clear in my memory. some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind. that the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. but 'in the very place'! why should this lonely beach be fatal to it? was it possible that it also, had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? was it possible----? yes, the perception was dim, but already something was building up in my mind. in a few minutes i was on my way to the gables, where i found stackhurst in his study. at my request he sent for sudbury and blount, the two students who had found the dog. "yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool," said one of them. "it must have followed the trail of its dead master." i saw the faithful little creature, an airedale terrier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. the body was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the limbs contorted. there was agony in every line of it. from the gables i walked down to the bathing-pool. the sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. the place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. in the fading light i could dimly make out the little dog's spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master's towel had been laid. for a long time i stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me. my mind was filled with racing thoughts. you have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and which you know is there, though it remains for ever just beyond your reach. that was how i felt that evening as i stood alone by that place of death. then at last i turned and walked slowly homewards. i had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. like a flash, i remembered the thing for which i had so eagerly and vainly grasped. you will know, or watson has written in vain, that i hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge, without scientific system, but very available for the needs of my work. my mind is like a crowded box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away therein--so many that i may well have but a vague perception of what was there. i had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter. it was still vague, but at least i knew how i could make it clear. it was monstrous, incredible, and yet it was always a possibility. i would test it to the full. there is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books. it was into this that i plunged and rummaged for an hour. at the end of that time i emerged with a little chocolate and silver volume. eagerly i turned up the chapter of which i had a dim remembrance. yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and yet i could not be at rest until i had made sure if it might, indeed, be so. it was late when i retired, with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow. but that work met with an annoying interruption. i had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when i had a call from inspector bardie of the sussex constabulary--a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled expression. "i know your immense experience, sir," said he. "this is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no farther. but i am fairly up against it in this mcpherson case. the question is, shall i make an arrest, or shall i not?" "meaning mr. ian murdoch?" "yes, sir. there is really no one else when you come to think of it. that's the advantage of this solitude. we narrow it down to a very small compass. if he did not do it, then who did?" "what have you against him?" he had gleaned along the same furrows as i had. there was murdoch's character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man. his furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog. the fact that he had quarrelled with mcpherson in the past, and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to miss bellamy. he had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure. "what would my position be if i let him slip away with all this evidence against him?" the burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind. "consider," i said, "all the essential gaps in your case. on the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi. he had been with his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of mcpherson's appearance he came upon us from behind. then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself. finally, there is this question of the instrument with which these injuries were inflicted." "what could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?" "have you examined the marks?" i asked. "i have seen them. so has the doctor." "but i have examined them very carefully with a lens. they have peculiarities." "what are they, mr. holmes?" i stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. "this is my method in such cases," i explained. "you certainly do things thoroughly, mr. holmes." "i should hardly be what i am if i did not. now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder. do you observe nothing remarkable?" "i can't say i do." "surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity. there is a dot of extravasated blood, here, and another there. there are similar indications in this other weal down here. what can that mean?" "i have no idea. have you?" "perhaps i have. perhaps i haven't. i may be able to say more soon. anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal." "it is, of course, an absurd idea," said the policeman, "but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these better-marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other." "a most ingenious comparison. or shall we say a very stiff cat-o'-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?" "by jove, mr. holmes, i think you have hit it." "or there may be some very different cause, mr. bardie. but your case is far too weak for an arrest. besides, we have those last words--'lion's mane.'" "i have wondered whether ian----" "yes, i have considered that. if the second word had borne any resemblance to murdoch--but it did not. he gave it almost in a shriek. i am sure that it was 'mane.'" "have you no alternative, mr. holmes?" "perhaps i have. but i do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss." "and when will that be?" "in an hour--possibly less." the inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes. "i wish i could see what was in your mind, mr. holmes. perhaps it's those fishing-boats." "no, no; they were too far out." "well, then, is it bellamy and that big son of his? they were not too sweet upon mr. mcpherson. could they have done him a mischief?" "no, no; you won't draw me until i am ready," said i with a smile. "now, inspector, we each have our own work to do. perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday----?" so far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was the beginning of the end. my outer door was flung open, there were blundering footsteps in the passage, and ian murdoch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect. "brandy! brandy!" he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa. he was not alone. behind him came stackhurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his companion. "yes, yes, brandy!" he cried. "the man is at his last gasp. it was all i could do to bring him here. he fainted twice upon the way." half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change. he pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from off his shoulders. "for god's sake! oil, opium, morphia!" he cried. "anything to ease this infernal agony!" the inspector and i cried out at the sight. there, criss-crossed upon the man's naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of fitzroy mcpherson. the pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the sufferer's breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black, and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his brow dropped beads of sweat. at any moment he might die. more and more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him back to life. pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds. at last his head fell heavily upon the cushion. exhausted nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality. it was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain. to question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of his condition stackhurst turned upon me. "my god!" he cried, "what is it, holmes? what is it?" "where did you find him?" "down on the beach. exactly where poor mcpherson met his end. if this man's heart had been weak as mcpherson's was, he would not be here now. more than once i thought he was gone as i brought him up. it was too far to the gables, so i made for you." "did you see him on the beach?" "i was walking on the cliff when i heard his cry. he was at the edge of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. i ran down, threw some clothes about him, and brought him up. for heaven's sake, holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. can you, with all your world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?" "i think i can, stackhurst. come with me now! and you, inspector, come along! we will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands." leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all three went down to the deadly lagoon. on the shingle there was piled a little heap of towels and clothes, left by the stricken man. slowly i walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in indian file behind me. most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep. it was to this part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. a line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and along this i led the way, peering eagerly into the depths beneath me. i had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and i burst into a shout of triumph. "cyanea!" i cried. "cyanea! behold the lion's mane!" the strange object at which i pointed did indeed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane of a lion. it lay upon a rocky shelf some three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses. it pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation and contraction. "it has done mischief enough. its day is over!" i cried. "help me, stackhurst! let us end the murderer for ever." there was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it fell with a tremendous splash into the water. when the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. one flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. a thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round, rising slowly to the surface. "well, this gets me!" cried the inspector. "what was it, mr. holmes? i'm born and bred in these parts, but i never saw such a thing. it don't belong to sussex." "just as well for sussex," i remarked. "it may have been the south-west gale that brought it up. come back to my house, both of you, and i will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas." when we reached my study, we found that murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up. he was dazed in mind, and every now and then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. in broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank. "here is a book," i said, taking up the little volume, "which first brought light into what might have been for ever dark. it is _out of doors_, by the famous observer j. g. wood. wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. _cyanea capillata_ is the miscreant's full name, and he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite of the cobra. let me briefly give this extract. "'if the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion's mane and silver paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, _cyanea capillata_.' could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described? "he goes on to tell his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of kent. he found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death. even at a distance the effect upon wood was almost fatal. 'the multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves.' "the local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite torment. 'pangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if struck by a bullet. the pulsation would cease, and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest.' "it nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool. he says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. he gulped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. there is the book, inspector. i leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor mcpherson." "and incidentally exonerates me," remarked ian murdoch with a wry smile. "i do not blame you, inspector, nor you, mr. holmes, for your suspicions were natural. i feel that on the very eve of my arrest i have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend." "no, mr. murdoch. i was already upon the track, and had i been out as early as i intended i might well have saved you from this terrific experience." "but how did you know, mr. holmes?" "i am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles. that phrase 'lion's mane' haunted my mind. i knew that i had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. you have seen that it does describe the creature. i have no doubt that it was floating on the water when mcpherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death." "then i, at least, am cleared," said murdoch, rising slowly to his feet. "there are one or two words of explanation which i should give, for i know the direction in which your inquiries have run. it is true that i loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend mcpherson my one desire was to help her to happiness. i was well content to stand aside and act as their go-between. often i carried their messages, and it was because i was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that i hastened to tell her of my friend's death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner. she would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest you should disapprove and i might suffer. but with your leave i must try to get back to the gables, for my bed will be very welcome." stackhurst held out his hand. "our nerves have all been at concert-pitch," said he. "forgive what is past, murdoch. we shall understand each other better in the future." they passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion. the inspector remained, staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes. "well, you've done it!" he cried at last. "i had read of you, but i never believed it. it's wonderful!" i was forced to shake my head. to accept such praise was to lower one's own standards. "i was slow at the outset--culpably slow. had the body been found in the water i could hardly have missed it. it was the towel which misled me. the poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so i in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water. why, then, should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me? that was where i went astray. well, well, inspector, i often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force, but _cyanea capillata_ very nearly avenged scotland yard." x the adventure of the veiled lodger when one considers that mr. sherlock holmes was in active practice for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these i was allowed to co-operate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it will be clear that i have a mass of material at my command. the problem has always been, not to find, but to choose. there is the long row of year-books which fill a shelf, and there are the dispatch-cases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the student, not only of crime, but of the social and official scandals of the late victorian era. concerning these latter, i may say that the writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forbears may not be touched, have nothing to fear. the discretion and high sense of professional honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. i deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. the source of these outrages is known, and if they are repeated i have mr. holmes's authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. there is at least one reader who will understand. it is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and observation which i have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs. sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it fell easily into his lap. but the most terrible human tragedies were often involved in these cases which brought him the fewest personal opportunities, and it is one of these which i now desire to record. in telling it, i have made a slight change of name and place, but otherwise the facts are as stated. one forenoon--it was late in 1896--i received a hurried note from holmes asking for my attendance. when i arrived, i found him seated in a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him. "this is mrs. merrilow, of south brixton," said my friend, with a wave of the hand. "mrs. merrilow does not object to tobacco, watson, if you wish to indulge your filthy habits. mrs. merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful." "anything i can do----" "you will understand, mrs. merrilow, that if i come to mrs. ronder i should prefer to have a witness. you will make her understand that before we arrive." "lord bless you, mr. holmes," said our visitor, "she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!" "then we shall come early in the afternoon. let us see that we have our facts correct before we start. if we go over them it will help dr. watson to understand the situation. you say that mrs. ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face." "and i wish to god i had not!" said mrs. merrilow. "it was, i understand, terribly mutilated." "well, mr. holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. that's how it looked. our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the front garden. that is the kind of face it is. when i saw her--i happened on her unawares--she covered up quick, and then she said, 'now, mrs. merrilow, you know at last why it is that i never raise my veil.'" "do you know anything about her history?" "nothing at all." "did she give references when she came?" "no, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. a quarter's rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. in these times a poor woman like me can't afford to turn down a chance like that." "did she give any reason for choosing your house?" "mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most. then, again, i only take the one, and i have no family of my own. i reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. it's privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it." "you say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion. well, it is a very remarkable story, most remarkable, and i don't wonder that you want it examined." "i don't, mr. holmes. i am quite satisfied so long as i get my rent. you could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble." "then what has brought matters to a head?" "her health, mr. holmes. she seems to be wasting away. and there's something terrible on her mind. 'murder!' she cries. 'murder!' and once i heard her, 'you cruel beast! you monster!' she cried. it was in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers through me. so i went to her in the morning. 'mrs. ronder,' i says, 'if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there's the clergy,' i says, 'and there's the police. between them you should get some help.' 'for god's sake, not the police!' says she, 'and the clergy can't change what is past. and yet,' she says, 'it would ease my mind if someone knew the truth before i died.' 'well,' says i, 'if you won't have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read about'--beggin' your pardon, mr. holmes. and she, she fair jumped at it. 'that's the man,' says she. 'i wonder i never thought of it before. bring him here, mrs. merrilow, and if he won't come, tell him i am the wife of ronder's wild beast show. say that, and give him the name abbas parva.' here it is as she wrote it, abbas parva. 'that will bring him, if he's the man i think he is.'" "and it will, too," remarked holmes. "very good, mrs. merrilow. i should like to have a little chat with dr. watson. that will carry us till lunch-time. about three o'clock you may expect to see us at your house in brixton." our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room--no other verb can describe mrs. merrilow's method of progression--than sherlock holmes threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in the corner. for a few minutes there was a constant swish of the leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he sought. so excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the floor like some strange buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round him, and one open upon his knees. "the case worried me at the time, watson. here are my marginal notes to prove it. i confess that i could make nothing of it. and yet i was convinced that the coroner was wrong. have you no recollection of the abbas parva tragedy?" "none, holmes." "and yet you were with me then. but certainly my own impression was very superficial, for there was nothing to go by, and none of the parties had engaged my services. perhaps you would care to read the papers?" "could you not give me the points?" "that is very easily done. it will probably come back to your memory as i talk. ronder, of course, was a household word. he was the rival of wombwell, and of sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day. there is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy. the caravan had halted for the night at abbas parva, which is a small village in berkshire, when this horror occurred. they were on their way to wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping, and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not have paid them to open. "they had among their exhibits a very fine north african lion. sahara king was its name, and it was the habit, both of ronder and his wife, to give exhibitions inside its cage. here, you see, is a photograph of the performance, by which you will perceive that ronder was a huge porcine person and that his wife was a very magnificent woman. it was deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was dangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice was taken of the fact. "it was usual for either ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night. sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors, and would never molest them. on this particular night, seven years ago, they both went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which have never been made clear. "it seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman. the different grooms and _employés_ rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their light an awful sight was revealed. ronder lay, with the back of his head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards from the cage, which was open. close to the door of the cage lay mrs. ronder, upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above her. it had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought that she could live. several of the circus men, headed by leonardo, the strongman, and griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage, and was at once locked in. how it had got loose was a mystery. it was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them. there was no other point of interest in the evidence, save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept screaming, 'coward! coward!' as she was carried back to the van in which they lived. it was six months before she was fit to give evidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure." "what alternative could be conceived?" said i. "you may well say so. and yet there were one or two points which worried young edmunds, of the berkshire constabulary. a smart lad that! he was sent later to allahabad. that was how i came into the matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it." "a thin, yellow-haired man?" "exactly. i was sure you would pick up the trail presently." "but what worried him?" "well, we were both worried. it was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair. look at it from the lion's point of view. he is liberated. what does he do? he takes half a dozen bounds forward, which brings him to ronder. ronder turns to fly,--the claw-marks were on the back of his head--but the lion strikes him down. then, instead of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. then, again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her. what could the poor devil have done to help her? you see the difficulty?" "quite." "and then there was another thing. it comes back to me now as i think it over. there was some evidence that, just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror." "this man ronder, no doubt." "well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again. there were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman." "i should think the whole camp was crying out by then. as to the other points, i think i could suggest a solution." "i should be glad to consider it." "the two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got loose. the man turned and was struck down. the woman conceived the idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. it was her only refuge. she made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded after her and knocked her over. she was angry with her husband for having encouraged the beast's rage by turning. if they had faced it, they might have cowed it. hence her cries of 'coward!'" "brilliant, watson! only one flaw in your diamond." "what is the flaw, holmes?" "if they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get loose?" "is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?" "and why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?" "possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it." holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments. "well, watson, there is this to be said for your theory. ronder was a man of many enemies. edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible. a huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way. i expect those cries about a monster, of which our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed. however, our speculations are futile until we have all the facts. there is a cold partridge on the sideboard, watson, and a bottle of montrachet. let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon them." when our hansom deposited us at the house of mrs. merrilow, we found that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired abode. it was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end. then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight, badly-carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious lodger. it was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected, since its inmate seldom left it. from keeping beasts in a cage, the woman seemed, by some retribution of fate, to have become herself a beast in a cage. she sat now in a broken arm-chair in the shadowy corner of the room. long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was still full and voluptuous. a thick dark veil covered her face, but it was cut off close at her upper lip, and disclosed a perfectly-shaped mouth and a delicately-rounded chin. i could well conceive that she had indeed been a very remarkable woman. her voice, too, was well-modulated and pleasing. "my name is not unfamiliar to you, mr. holmes," said she. "i thought that it would bring you." "that is so, madam, though i do not know how you are aware that i was interested in your case." "i learned it when i had recovered my health and was examined by mr. edmunds, the county detective. i fear i lied to him. perhaps it would have been wiser had i told the truth." "it is usually wiser to tell the truth. but why did you lie to him?" "because the fate of someone else depended upon it. i know that he was a very worthless being, and yet i would not have his destruction upon my conscience. we had been so close--so close!" "but has this impediment been removed?" "yes, sir. the person that i allude to is dead." "then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?" "because there is another person to be considered. that other person is myself. i could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from a police examination. i have not long to live, but i wish to die undisturbed. and yet i wanted to find one man of judgment to whom i could tell my terrible story, so that when i am gone all might be understood." "you compliment me, madam. at the same time, i am a responsible person. i do not promise you that when you have spoken i may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police." "i think not, mr. holmes. i know your character and methods too well, for i have followed your work for some years. reading is the only pleasure which fate has left me, and i miss little which passes in the world. but in any case, i will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy. it will ease my mind to tell it." "my friend and i would be glad to hear it." the woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. he was clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile breaking from under his heavy moustache--the self-satisfied smile of the man of many conquests. "that is leonardo," she said. "leonardo, the strongman, who gave evidence?" "the same. and this--this is my husband." it was a dreadful face--a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for it was formidable in its bestiality. one could imagine that vile mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the world, ruffian, bully, beast--it was all written on that heavy-jowled face. "those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the story. i was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing springs through the hoop before i was ten. when i became a woman this man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil moment i became his wife. from that day i was in hell, and he the devil who tormented me. there was no one in the show who did not know of his treatment. he deserted me for others. he tied me down and lashed me with his riding-whip when i complained. they all pitied me and they all loathed him, but what could they do? they feared him, one and all. for he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he was drunk. again and again he was had for assault, and for cruelty to the beasts, but he had plenty of money and the fines were nothing to him. the best men all left us and the show began to go downhill. it was only leonardo and i who kept it up--with little jimmy griggs, the clown. poor devil, he had not much to be funny about, but he did what he could to hold things together. "then leonardo came more and more into my life. you see what he was like. i know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body, but compared to my husband he seemed like the angel gabriel. he pitied me and helped me, till at last our intimacy turned to love--deep, deep, passionate love, such love as i had dreamed of but never hoped to feel. my husband suspected it, but i think that he was a coward as well as a bully, and that leonardo was the one man that he was afraid of. he took revenge in his own way by torturing me more than ever. one night my cries brought leonardo to the door of our van. we were near tragedy that night, and soon my lover and i understood that it could not be avoided. my husband was not fit to live. we planned that he should die. "leonardo had a clever, scheming brain. it was he who planned it. i do not say that to blame him, for i was ready to go with him every inch of the way. but i should never have had the wit to think of such a plan. we made a club--leonardo made it--and in the leaden head he fastened five long steel nails, the points outwards, with just such a spread as the lion's paw. this was to give my husband his death-blow, and yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose who had done the deed. "it was a pitch-dark night when my husband and i went down, as was our custom, to feed the beast. we carried with us the raw meat in a zinc pail. leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we should have to pass before we reached the cage. he was too slow, and we walked past him before he could strike, but he followed us on tiptoe and i heard the crash as the club smashed my husband's skull. my heart leaped with joy at the sound. i sprang forward, and i undid the catch which held the door of the great lion's cage. "and then the terrible thing happened. you may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood, and how it excites them. some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human being had been slain. as i slipped the bars it bounded out, and was on me in an instant. leonardo could have saved me. if he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it. but the man lost his nerve. i heard him shout in his terror, and then i saw him turn and fly. at the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face. its hot, filthy breath had already poisoned me and i was hardly conscious of pain. with the palms of my hands i tried to push the great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me, and i screamed for help. i was conscious that the camp was stirring, and then dimly i remember a group of men, leonardo, griggs and others, dragging me from under the creature's paws. that was my last memory, mr. holmes, for many a weary month. when i came to myself, and saw myself in the mirror, i cursed that lion--oh, how i cursed him!---not because he had torn away my beauty, but because he had not torn away my life. i had but one desire, mr. holmes, and i had enough money to gratify it. it was that i should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none, and that i should dwell where none whom i had ever known should find me. that was all that was left to me to do--and that is what i have done. a poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die--that is the end of eugenia ronder." we sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her story. then holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with such a show of sympathy as i had seldom known him to exhibit. "poor girl!" he said. "poor girl! the ways of fate are indeed hard to understand. if there is not some compensation hereafter, then the world is a cruel jest. but what of this man leonardo?" "i never saw him or heard from him again. perhaps i have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him. he might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left. but a woman's love is not so easily set aside. he had left me under the beast's claws, he had deserted me in my need, and yet i could not bring myself to give him to the gallows. for myself, i cared nothing what became of me. what could be more dreadful than my actual life? but i stood between leonardo and his fate." "and he is dead?" "he was drowned last month when bathing near margate. i saw his death in the paper." "and what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story?" "i cannot tell, mr. holmes. there is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a deep green pool at the base of it. perhaps in the depths of that pool----" "well, well, it is of little consequence now. the case is closed." "yes," said the woman, "the case is closed." we had risen to go, but there was something in the woman's voice which arrested holmes's attention. he turned swiftly upon her. "your life is not your own," he said. "keep your hands off it." "what use is it to anyone?" "how can you tell? the example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world." the woman's answer was a terrible one. she raised her veil and stepped forward into the light. "i wonder if you would bear it," she said. it was horrible. no words can describe the framework of a face when the face itself is gone. two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful. holmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and together we left the room. two days later, when i called upon my friend, he pointed with some pride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece. i picked it up. there was a red poison label. a pleasant almondy odour rose when i opened it. "prussic acid?" said i. "exactly. it came by post. 'i send you my temptation. i will follow your advice.' that was the message. i think, watson, we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it." xi the adventure of shoscombe old place sherlock holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power microscope. now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph. "it is glue, watson," said he. "unquestionably it is glue. have a look at these scattered objects in the field!" i stooped to the eyepiece and focused for my vision. "those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. the irregular grey masses are dust. there are epithelial scales on the left. those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue." "well," i said, laughing, "i am prepared to take your word for it. does anything depend upon it?" "it is a very fine demonstration," he answered. "in the st. pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman. the accused man denies that it is his. but he is a picture-frame maker who habitually handles glue." "is it one of your cases?" "no; my friend, merivale of the yard, asked me to look into the case. since i ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope." he looked impatiently at his watch. "i had a new client calling, but he is overdue. by the way, watson, you know something of racing?" "i ought to. i pay for it with about half my wound pension." "then i'll make you my 'handy guide to the turf.' what about sir robert norberton? does the name recall anything?" "well, i should say so. he lives at shoscombe old place, and i know it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. norberton nearly came within your province once." "how was that?" "it was when he horsewhipped sam brewer, the well-known curzon street moneylender, on newmarket heath. he nearly killed the man." "ah, he sounds interesting! does he often indulge in that way?" "well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. he is about the most daredevil rider in england--second in the grand national a few years back. he is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. he should have been a buck in the days of the regency--a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all account, so far down queer street that he may never find his way back again." "capital, watson! a thumb-nail sketch. i seem to know the man. now, can you give me some idea of shoscombe old place?" "only that it is in the centre of shoscombe park, and that the famous shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there." "and the head trainer," said holmes, "is john mason. you need not look surprised at my knowledge, watson, for this is a letter from him which i am unfolding. but let us have some more about shoscombe. i seem to have struck a rich vein." "there are the shoscombe spaniels," said i. "you hear of them at every dog show. the most exclusive breed in england. they are the special pride of the lady of shoscombe old place." "sir robert norberton's wife, i presume!" "sir robert has never married. just as well, i think, considering his prospects. he lives with his widowed sister, lady beatrice falder." "you mean that she lives with him?" "no, no. the place belonged to her late husband, sir james. norberton has no claim on it at all. it is only a life interest and reverts to her husband's brother. meantime, she draws the rents every year." "and brother robert, i suppose, spends the said rents?" "that is about the size of it. he is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. yet i have heard that she is devoted to him. but what is amiss at shoscombe?" "ah, that is just what i want to know. and here, i expect, is the man who can tell us." the door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys. mr. john mason had many of both under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. he bowed with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which holmes had waved him. "you had my note, mr. holmes?" "yes, but it explained nothing." "it was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. and too complicated. it was only face to face i could do it." "well, we are at your disposal." "first of all, mr. holmes, i think that my employer, sir robert, has gone mad." holmes raised his eyebrows. "this is baker street, not harley street," said he. "but why do you say so?" "well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you begin to wonder. i believe shoscombe prince and the derby have turned his brain." "that is a colt you are running?" "the best in england, mr. holmes. i should know, if anyone does. now, i'll be plain with you, for i know you are gentlemen of honour and that it won't go beyond the room. sir robert has got to win this derby. he's up to the neck, and it's his last chance. everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse--and at fine odds, too! you can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him." "but how is that, if the horse is so good?" "the public don't know how good he is. sir robert has been too clever for the touts. he has the prince's half-brother out for spins. you can't tell 'em apart. but there are two lengths in a furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. he thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. his whole life is on it. he's holding off the jews till then. if the prince fails him, he is done." "it seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come in?" "well, first of all, you have only to look at him. i don't believe he sleeps at night. he is down at the stables at all hours. his eyes are wild. it has all been too much for his nerves. then there is his conduct to lady beatrice!" "ah! what is that?" "they have always been the best of friends. they had the same tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them--and, above all, she loved the prince. he would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. but that's all over now." "why?" "well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. for a week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as 'good morning'!" "you think there has been a quarrel?" "and a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? he gave it a few days ago to old barnes, what keeps the 'green dragon,' three miles off, at crendall." "that certainly did seem strange." "of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn't expect that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her room. he might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good friend to him. but that's all over, too. he never goes near her. and she takes it to heart. she is brooding and sulky and drinking, mr. holmes--drinking like a fish." "did she drink before this estrangement?" "well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening. so stephens, the butler, told me. it's all changed, mr. holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. but then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night? and who is the man that meets him there?" holmes rubbed his hands. "go on, mr. mason. you get more and more interesting." "it was the butler who saw him go. twelve o'clock at night and raining hard. so next night i was up at the house and, sure enough, master was off again. stephens and i went after him, but it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. he's a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. so we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all right. it was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting for him there." "what is this haunted crypt?" "well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. it is so old that nobody could fix its date. and under it there's a crypt which has a bad name among us. it's a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. but master's not afraid. he never feared anything in his life. but what is he doing there in the night-time?" "wait a bit!" said holmes. "you say there is another man there. it must be one of your own stable-men, or someone from the house! surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?" "it's no one i know." "how can you say that?" "because i have seen him, mr. holmes. it was on that second night. sir robert turned and passed us--me and stephens, quaking in the bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. but we could hear the other moving about behind. we were not afraid of him. so we up when sir robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please. 'hullo, mate! who may you be?' says i. i guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell. he let out a yell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. he could run!--i'll give him that. in a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found." "but you saw him clearly in the moonlight?" "yes, i would swear to his yellow face--a mean dog, i should say. what could he have in common with sir robert?" holmes sat for some time lost in thought. "who keeps lady beatrice falder company?" he asked at last. "there is her maid, carrie evans. she has been with her this five years." "and is, no doubt, devoted?" mr. mason shuffled uncomfortably. "she's devoted enough," he answered at last. "but i won't say to whom." "ah!" said holmes. "i can't tell tales out of school." "i quite understand, mr. mason. of course, the situation is clear enough. from dr. watson's description of sir robert i can realize that no woman is safe from him. don't you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there?" "well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time." "but she may not have seen it before. let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out. she wants to get rid of the woman. her brother will not permit it. the invalid, with her weak heart and inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. the hated maid is still tied to her. the lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. sir robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. does not all this hang together?" "well, it might do--so far as it goes." "exactly! as far as it goes. how would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? we can't fit that into our plot." "no, sir, and there is something more that i can't fit in. why should sir robert want to dig up a dead body?" holmes sat up abruptly. "we only found it out yesterday--after i had written to you. yesterday sir robert had gone to london, so stephens and i went down to the crypt. it was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit of a human body." "you informed the police, i suppose?" our visitor smiled grimly. "well, sir, i think it would hardly interest them. it was just the head and a few bones of a mummy. it may have been a thousand years old. but it wasn't there before. that i'll swear, and so will stephens. it had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that corner had always been empty before." "what did you do with it?" "well, we just left it there." "that was wise. you say sir robert was away yesterday. has he returned?" "we expect him back to-day." "when did sir robert give away his sister's dog?" "it was just a week ago to-day. the creature was howling outside the old well-house, and sir robert was in one of his tantrums that morning. he caught it up and i thought he would have killed it. then he gave it to sandy bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old barnes at the 'green dragon,' for he never wished to see it again." holmes sat for some time in silent thought. he had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes. "i am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, mr. mason," he said at last. "can't you make it more definite?" "perhaps this will make it more definite, mr. holmes," said our visitor. he took a paper from his pocket and, unwrapping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of bone. holmes examined it with interest. "where did you get it?" "there is a central heating furnace in the cellar under lady beatrice's room. it's been off for some time, but sir robert complained of cold and had it on again. harvey runs it--he's one of my lads. this very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders. he didn't like the look of it." "nor do i," said holmes. "what do you make of it, watson?" it was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance. "it's the upper condyle of a human femur," said i. "exactly!" holmes had become very serious. "when does this lad tend to the furnace?" "he makes it up every evening and then leaves it." "then anyone could visit it during the night? "yes, sir." "can you enter it from outside?" "there is one door from outside. there is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which lady beatrice's room is situated." "these are deep waters, mr. mason; deep and rather dirty. you say that sir robert was not at home last night?" "no, sir." "then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he." "that's true, sir." "what is the name of that inn you spoke of?" "the 'green dragon.'" "is there good fishing in that part of berkshire?" the honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life. "well, sir, i've heard there are trout in the millstream and pike in the hall lake." "that's good enough. watson and i are famous fishermen--are we not, watson? you may address us in future at the 'green dragon.' we should reach it to-night. i need not say that we don't want to see you, mr. mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt i could find you if i want you. when we have gone a little farther into the matter i will let you have a considered opinion." thus it was that on a bright may evening holmes and i found ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little "halt-on-demand" station of shoscombe. the rack above us was covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels and baskets. on reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sporting host, josiah barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood. "what about the hall lake and the chance of a pike?" said holmes. the face of the innkeeper clouded. "that wouldn't do, sir. you might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through." "how's that, then?" "it's sir robert, sir. he's terrible jealous of touts. if you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he'd be after you as sure as fate. he ain't taking no chances, sir robert ain't." "i've heard he has a horse entered for the derby." "yes, and a good colt, too. he carries all our money for the race, and all sir robert's into the bargain. by the way"--he looked at us with thoughtful eyes--"i suppose you ain't on the turf yourselves?" "no, indeed. just two weary londoners who badly need some good berkshire air." "well, you are in the right place for that. there is a deal of it lying about. but mind what i have told you about sir robert. he's the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. keep clear of the park." "surely, mr. barnes! we certainly shall. by the way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall." "i should say it was. that was the real shoscombe breed. there ain't a better in england." "i am a dog-fancier myself," said holmes. "now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize dog like that cost?" "more than i could pay, sir. it was sir robert himself who gave me this one. that's why i have to keep it on a lead. it would be off to the hall in a jiffy if i gave it its head." "we are getting some cards in our hand, watson," said holmes, when the landlord had left us. "it's not an easy one to play, but we may see our way in a day or two. by the way sir robert is still in london, i hear. we might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily assault. there are one or two points on which i should like reassurance." "have you any theory, holmes?" "only this, watson, that something happened a week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the shoscombe household. what is that something? we can only guess at it from its effects. they seem to be of a curiously mixed character. but that should surely help us. it is only the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless. "let us consider our data. the brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister. he gives away her favourite dog. her dog, watson! does that suggest nothing to you?" "nothing but the brother's spite." "well, it might be so. or--well, there is an alternative. now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. the lady keeps her room, alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to drink. that covers the case, does it not?" "save for the business in the crypt." "that is another line of thought. there are two, and i beg you will not tangle them. line a, which concerns lady beatrice, has a vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?" "i can make nothing of it." "well, now, let us take up line b, which concerns sir robert. he is mad keen upon winning the derby. he is in the hands of the jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors. he is a daring and desperate man. he derives his income from his sister. his sister's maid is his willing tool. so far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?" "but the crypt?" "ah, yes, the crypt! let us suppose, watson--it is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument's sake--that sir robert has done away with his sister." "my dear holmes, it is out of the question." "very possibly, watson. sir robert is a man of an honourable stock. but you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. let us for a moment argue upon this supposition. he could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with shoscombe prince. therefore, he has still to stand his ground. to do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would impersonate her. with the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible. the woman's body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen. what say you to that, watson?" "well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition." "i think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow, watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. meanwhile, if we mean to keep up our characters, i suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. we may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process." in the morning holmes discovered that we had come without our spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. about eleven o'clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us. "this is the place," said he, as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them. "about midday, mr. barnes informs me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened. when it comes through, and before it gathers speed, i want you, watson, to stop the coachman with some question. never mind me. i shall stand behind this holly-bush and see what i can see." it was not a long vigil. within a quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid, high-stepping grey carriage horses in the shafts. holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. i stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the roadway. a keeper ran out and the gates swung open. the carriage had slowed to a walk and i was able to get a good look at the occupants. a highly-coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left. at her right was an elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid. when the horses reached the high road i held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up i inquired if sir robert was at shoscombe old place. at the same moment holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. with a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above it. "drive on! drive on!" shrieked a harsh voice. the coachman lashed the horses, and we were left standing in the roadway. "well, watson, that's done it," said holmes, as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel. "he thought it was his mistress and he found it was a stranger. dogs don't make mistakes." "but it was the voice of a man!" i cried. "exactly! we have added one card to our hand, watson, but it needs careful playing, all the same." my companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result that we had a dish of trout for our supper. it was only after that meal that holmes showed signs of renewed activity. once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. a tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our london acquaintance, mr. john mason, the trainer. "good evening, gentlemen," said he. "i got your note, mr. holmes. sir robert has not returned yet, but i hear that he is expected to-night." "how far is this crypt from the house?" asked holmes. "a good quarter of a mile." "then i think we can disregard him altogether." "i can't afford to do that, mr. holmes. the moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of shoscombe prince." "i see! in that case we must work without you, mr. mason. you can show us the crypt and then leave us." it was pitch-dark and without a moon, but mason led us over the grass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel. we entered the broken gap which was once the porch and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the crypt. striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy place--dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. holmes had lit his lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of death. "you spoke of some bones, mr. mason. could you show them before you go?" "they are here in this corner." the trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. "they are gone," said he. "so i expected," said holmes, chuckling. "i fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part." "but why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years?" asked john mason. "that is what we are here to find out," said holmes. "it may mean a long search, and we need not detain you. i fancy that we shall get our solution before morning." when john mason had left us, holmes set to work making a very careful examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which appeared to be saxon, in the centre, through a long line of norman hugos and odos, until we reached the sir william and sir denis falder of the eighteenth century. it was an hour or more before holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. i heard his little cry of satisfaction, and was aware from his hurried but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. with his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. then he drew from his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a couple of clamps. there was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption. someone was walking in the chapel above. it was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon which he walked. a light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the gothic archway. he was a terrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. a large stable-lantern which he held in front of him shone upwards upon a strong, heavily-moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my companion and myself. "who the devil are you?" he thundered. "and what are you doing upon my property?" then, as holmes returned no answer, he took a couple of steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. "do you hear me?" he cried. "who are you? what are you doing here?" his cudgel quivered in the air. but instead of shrinking, holmes advanced to meet him. "i also have a question to ask you, sir robert," he said in his sternest tone. "who is this? and what is it doing here?" he turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. in the glare of the lantern i saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot, with dreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face. the baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against a stone sarcophagus. "how came you to know of this?" he cried. and then, with some return of his truculent manner: "what business is it of yours?" "my name is sherlock holmes," said my companion. "possibly it is familiar to you. in any case, my business is that of every other good citizen--to uphold the law. it seems to me that you have much to answer for." sir robert glared for a moment, but holmes's quiet voice and cool, assured manner had their effect. "'fore god, mr. holmes, it's all right," said he. "appearances are against me, i'll admit, but i could act no otherwise." "i should be happy to think so, but i fear your explanations must be for the police." sir robert shrugged his broad shoulders. "well, if it must be, it must. come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands." quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what i judge, from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of the old house. it was comfortably furnished, and here sir robert left us for a few moments. when he returned he had two companions with him; the one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the other, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. these two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken. "there," said sir robert, with a wave of his hand, "are mr. and mrs. norlett. mrs. norlett, under her maiden name of evans, has for some years been my sister's confidential maid. i have brought them here because i feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what i say." "is this necessary, sir robert? have you thought what you are doing?" cried the woman. "as to me, i entirely disclaim all responsibility," said her husband. sir robert gave him a glance of contempt. "i will take all responsibility," said he. "now, mr. holmes, listen to a plain statement of the facts. "you have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or i should not have found you where i did. therefore, you know already, in all probability, that i am running a dark horse for the derby and that everything depends upon my success. if i win, all is easy. if i lose--well, i dare not think of that!" "i understand the position," said holmes. "i am dependent upon my sister, lady beatrice, for everything. but it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only. for myself, i am deeply in the hands of the jews. i have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures. everything would be seized; my stables, my horses--everything. well, mr. holmes, my sister _did_ die just a week ago." "and you told no one!" "what could i do? absolute ruin faced me. if i could stave things off for three weeks all would be well. her maid's husband--this man here--is an actor. it came into our heads--it came into my head--that he could for that short period personate my sister. it was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the maid. it was not difficult to arrange. my sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her." "that will be for a coroner to decide." "her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end." "well, what did you do?" "the body could not remain there. on the first night norlett and i carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. we were followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the door, so i felt some safer place was needed. i got rid of the spaniel and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. there was no indignity or irreverence, mr. holmes. i do not feel that i have wronged the dead." "your conduct seems to me inexcusable, sir robert." the baronet shook his head impatiently. "it is easy to preach," said he. "perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position. one cannot see all one's hopes and all one's plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them. it seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband's ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground. we opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and placed her as you have seen her. as to the old relics which we took out, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. norlett and i removed them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace. there is my story, mr. holmes, though how you forced my hand so that i have to tell it is more than i can say." holmes sat for some time lost in thought. "there is one flaw in your narrative, sir robert," he said at last. "your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate." "the horse would be part of the estate. what do they care for my bets? as likely as not they would not run him at all. my chief creditor is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy--a rascally fellow, sam brewer, whom i was once compelled to horsewhip on newmarket heath. do you suppose that he would try to save me?" "well, sir robert," said holmes, rising, "this matter must, of course, be referred to the police. it was my duty to bring the facts to light and there i must leave it. as to the morality or decency of your own conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. it is nearly midnight, watson, and i think we may make our way back to our humble abode." it is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a happier note than sir robert's actions deserved. shoscombe prince did win the derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over, when they were paid in full, and enough was left to re-establish sir robert in a fair position in life. both police and coroner took a lenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay in registering the lady's decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age. xii the adventure of the retired colourman sherlock holmes was in a melancholy and philosophic mood that morning. his alert practical nature was subject to such reactions. "did you see him?" he asked. "you mean the old fellow who has just gone out?" "precisely." "yes, i met him at the door." "what did you think of him?" "a pathetic, futile, broken creature." "exactly, watson. pathetic and futile. but is not all life pathetic and futile? is not his story a microcosm of the whole? we reach. we grasp. and what is left in our hands at the end? a shadow. or worse than a shadow--misery." "is he one of your clients?" "well, i suppose i may call him so. he has been sent on by the yard. just as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack. they argue that they can do nothing more, and that whatever happens the patient can be no worse than he is." "what is the matter?" holmes took a rather soiled card from the table. "josiah amberley. he says he was junior partner of brickfall and amberley, who are manufacturers of artistic materials. you will see their names upon paint-boxes. he made his little pile, retired from business at the age of sixty-one, bought a house at lewisham, and settled down to rest after a life of ceaseless grind. one would think his future was tolerably assured." "yes, indeed." holmes glanced over some notes which he had scribbled upon the back of an envelope. "retired in 1896, watson. early in 1897 he married a woman twenty years younger than himself--a good-looking woman, too, if the photograph does not flatter. a competence, a wife, leisure--it seemed a straight road which lay before him. and yet within two years he is, as you have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath the sun." "but what has happened?" "the old story, watson. a treacherous friend and a fickle wife. it would appear that amberley has one hobby in life, and it is chess. not far from him at lewisham there lives a young doctor who is also a chess-player. i have noted his name as dr. ray ernest. ernest was frequently in the house, and an intimacy between him and mrs. amberley was a natural sequence, for you must admit that our unfortunate client has few outward graces, whatever his inner virtues may be. the couple went off together last week--destination untraced. what is more, the faithless spouse carried off the old man's deed-box as her personal luggage with a good part of his life's savings within. can we find the lady? can we save the money? a commonplace problem so far as it has developed, and yet a vital one for josiah amberley." "what will you do about it?" "well, the immediate question, my dear watson, happens to be, what will _you_ do?--if you will be good enough to understudy me. you know that i am preoccupied with this case of the two coptic patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day. i really have not time to go out to lewisham, and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value. the old fellow was quite insistent that i should go, but i explained my difficulty. he is prepared to meet a representative." "by all means," i answered. "i confess i don't see that i can be of much service, but i am willing to do my best." and so it was that on a summer afternoon i set forth to lewisham, little dreaming that within a week the affair in which i was engaging would be the eager debate of all england. it was late that evening before i returned to baker street and gave an account of my mission. holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in his deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths of acrid tobacco, while his eyelids drooped over his eyes so lazily that he might almost have been asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable passage of my narrative they half lifted, and two grey eyes, as bright and keen as rapiers, transfixed me with their searching glance. "the haven is the name of mr. josiah amberley's house," i explained. "i think it would interest you, holmes. it is like some penurious patrician who has sunk into the company of his inferiors. you know that particular quarter, the monotonous brick streets, the weary suburban highways. right in the middle of them, a little island of ancient culture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded by a high sun-baked wall mottled with lichens and topped with moss, the sort of wall----" "cut out the poetry, watson," said holmes severely. "i note that it was a high brick wall." "exactly. i should not have known which was the haven had i not asked a lounger who was smoking in the street. i have a reason for mentioning him. he was a tall, dark, heavily-moustached, rather military-looking man. he nodded in answer to my inquiry and gave me a curiously questioning glance, which came back to my memory a little later. "i had hardly entered the gateway before i saw mr. amberley coming down the drive. i only had a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly gave me the impression of a strange creature, but when i saw him in full light his appearance was even more abnormal." "i have, of course, studied it, and yet i should be interested to have your impression," said holmes. "he seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care. his back was curved as though he carried a heavy burden. yet he was not the weakling that i had at first imagined, for his shoulders and chest have the framework of a giant, though his figure tapers away into a pair of spindled legs." "left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth." "i did not observe that." "no, you wouldn't. i spotted his artificial limb. but proceed." "i was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from under his old straw hat, and his face with its fierce, eager expression and the deeply-lined features." "very good, watson. what did he say?" "he began pouring out the story of his grievances. we walked down the drive together, and of course i took a good look round. i have never seen a worse-kept place. the garden was all running to seed, giving me an impression of wild neglect in which the plants had been allowed to find the way of nature rather than of art. how any decent woman could have tolerated such a state of things, i don't know. the house, too, was slatternly to the last degree, but the poor man seemed himself to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it, for a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of the hall and he was carrying a thick brush in his left hand. he had been working on the woodwork. "he took me into his dingy sanctum, and we had a long chat. of course, he was disappointed that you had not come yourself. 'i hardly expected,' he said, 'that so humble an individual as myself, especially after my heavy financial loss, could obtain the complete attention of so famous a man as mr. sherlock holmes.' "i assured him that the financial question did not arise. 'no, of course, it is art for art's sake with him,' said he; 'but even on the artistic side of crime he might have found something here to study. and human nature, dr. watson--the black ingratitude of it all! when did i ever refuse one of her requests? was ever a woman so pampered? and that young man--he might have been my own son. he had the run of my house. and yet see how they have treated me! oh, dr. watson, it is a dreadful, dreadful world!' "that was the burden of his song for an hour or more. he had, it seems, no suspicion of an intrigue. they lived alone save for a woman who comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six. on that particular evening old amberley, wishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two upper circle seats at the haymarket theatre. at the last moment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go. he had gone alone. there seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he produced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife." "that is remarkable--most remarkable," said holmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be rising. "pray continue, watson. i find your narrative most arresting. did you personally examine this ticket? you did not, perchance, take the number?" "it so happens that i did," i answered with some pride. "it chanced to be my old school number, thirty-one, and so it stuck in my head." "excellent, watson! his seat, then, was either thirty or thirty-two." "quite so," i answered, with some mystification. "and on b row." "that is most satisfactory. what else did he tell you?" "he showed me his strong-room, as he called it. it really is a strong-room--like a bank--with iron door and shutter--burglar-proof, as he claimed. however, the woman seems to have had a duplicate key, and between them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds' worth of cash and securities." "securities! how could they dispose of those?" "he said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they would be unsalable. he had got back from the theatre about midnight, and found the place plundered, the door and window open and the fugitives gone. there was no letter or message, nor has he heard a word since. he at once gave the alarm to the police." holmes brooded for some minutes. "you say he was painting. what was he painting?" "well, he was painting the passage. but he had already painted the door and woodwork of this room i spoke of." "does it not strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances?" "'one must do something to ease an aching heart.' that was his own explanation. it was eccentric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man. he tore up one of his wife's photographs in my presence--tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion. 'i never wish to see her damned face again,' he shrieked." "anything more, watson?" "yes, one thing which struck me more than anything else. i had driven to the blackheath station and had caught my train there, when just as it was starting i saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own. you know that i have a quick eye for faces, holmes. it was undoubtedly the tall, dark man whom i had addressed in the street. i saw him once more at london bridge, and then i lost him in the crowd. but i am convinced that he was following me." "no doubt! no doubt!" said holmes. "a tall, dark, heavily-moustached man, you say, with grey-tinted sun-glasses?" "holmes, you are a wizard. i did not say so, but he had grey-tinted sun-glasses." "and a masonic tie-pin?" "holmes!" "quite simple, my dear watson. but let us get down to what is practical. i must admit to you that the case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly assuming a very different aspect. it is true that though in your mission you have missed everything of importance, yet even those things which have obtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought." "what have i missed?" "don't be hurt, my dear fellow. you know that i am quite impersonal. no one else would have done better. some possibly not so well. but clearly you have missed some vital points. what is the opinion of the neighbours about this man amberley and his wife? that surely is of importance. what of dr. ernest? was he the gay lothario one would expect? with your natural advantages, watson, every lady is your helper and accomplice. what about the girl at the post office, or the wife of the greengrocer? i can picture you whispering soft nothings with the young lady at the 'blue anchor,' and receiving hard somethings in exchange. all this you have left undone." "it can still be done." "it has been done. thanks to the telephone and the help of the yard, i can usually get my essentials without leaving this room. as a matter of fact, my information confirms the man's story. he has the local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband. that he had a large sum of money in that strong-room of his is certain. so also is it that young dr. ernest, an unmarried man, played chess with amberley, and probably played the fool with his wife. all this seems plain sailing, and one would think that there was no more to be said--and yet!--and yet!" "where lies the difficulty?" "in my imagination, perhaps. well, leave it there, watson. let us escape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music. carina sings to-night at the albert hall, and we still have time to dress, dine and enjoy." in the morning i was up betimes, but some toast crumbs and two empty egg-shells told me that my companion was earlier still. i found a scribbled note upon the table. dear watson,-- there are one or two points of contact which i should wish to establish with mr. josiah amberley. when i have done so we can dismiss the case--or not. i would only ask you to be on hand about three o'clock, as i conceive it possible that i may want you. s. h. i saw nothing of holmes all day, but at the hour named he returned, grave, preoccupied and aloof. at such times it was wiser to leave him to himself. "has amberley been here yet?" "no." "ah! i am expecting him." he was not disappointed, for presently the old fellow arrived with a very worried and puzzled expression upon his austere face. "i've had a telegram, mr. holmes. i can make nothing of it." he handed it over, and holmes read it aloud. "come at once without fail. can give you information as to your recent loss.--elman. the vicarage." "dispatched at two-ten from little turlington," said holmes. "little turlington is in essex, i believe, not far from frinton. well, of course you will start at once. this is evidently from a responsible person, the vicar of the place. where is my crockford? yes, here we have him. j. c. elman, m.a., living of mossmoor cum little purlington. look up the trains, watson." "there is one at five-twenty from liverpool street." "excellent. you had best go with him, watson. he may need help or advice. clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair." but our client seemed by no means eager to start. "it's perfectly absurd, mr. holmes," he said. "what can this man possibly know of what has occurred? it is waste of time and money." "he would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something. wire at once that you are coming." "i don't think i shall go." holmes assumed his sternest aspect. "it would make the worst possible impression both on the police and upon myself, mr. amberley, if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse to follow it up. we should feel that you were not really in earnest in this investigation." our client seemed horrified at the suggestion. "why, of course i shall go if you look at it in that way," said he. "on the face of it, it seems absurd to suppose that this parson knows anything, but if you think----" "i _do_ think," said holmes, with emphasis, and so we were launched upon our journey. holmes took me aside before we left the room and gave me one word of counsel which showed that he considered the matter to be of importance. "whatever you do, see that he really _does_ go," said he. "should he break away or return, get to the nearest telephone exchange and send the single word 'bolted.' i will arrange here that it shall reach me wherever i am." little purlington is not an easy place to reach, for it is on a branch line. my remembrance of the journey is not a pleasant one, for the weather was hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and silent, hardly talking at all, save to make an occasional sardonic remark as to the futility of our proceedings. when we at last reached the little station it was a two-mile drive before we came to the vicarage, where a big, solemn, rather pompous clergyman received us in his study. our telegram lay before him. "well, gentlemen," he asked, "what can i do for you?" "we came," i explained, "in answer to your wire." "my wire! i sent no wire." "i mean the wire which you sent to mr. josiah amberley about his wife and his money." "if this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable one," said the vicar angrily. "i have never heard of the gentleman you name, and i have not sent a wire to anyone." our client and i looked at each other in amazement. "perhaps there is some mistake," said i; "are there perhaps two vicarages? here is the wire itself, signed elman, and dated from the vicarage." "there is only one vicarage, sir, and only one vicar, and this wire is a scandalous forgery, the origin of which shall certainly be investigated by the police. meanwhile, i can see no possible object in prolonging this interview." so mr. amberley and i found ourselves on the roadside in what seemed to me to be the most primitive village in england. we made for the telegraph office, but it was already closed. there was a telephone, however, at the little 'railway arms,' and by it i got into touch with holmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey. "most singular!" said the distant voice. "most remarkable! i much fear, my dear watson, that there is no return train to-night. i have unwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn. however, there is always nature, watson--nature and josiah amberley--you can be in close commune with both." i heard his dry chuckle as he turned away. it was soon apparent to me that my companion's reputation as a miser was not undeserved. he had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had insisted upon travelling third-class, and was now clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill. next morning, when we did at last arrive in london, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour. "you had best take baker street as we pass," said i. "mr. holmes may have some fresh instructions." "if they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much use," said amberley, with a malevolent scowl. none the less, he kept me company. i had already warned holmes by telegram of the hour of our arrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at lewisham, and would expect us there. that was a surprise, but an even greater one was to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client. a stern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with grey-tinted glasses and a large masonic pin projecting from his tie. "this is my friend mr. barker," said holmes. "he has been interesting himself also in your business, mr. josiah amberley, though we have been working independently. but we both have the same question to ask you!" mr. amberley sat down heavily. he sensed impending danger. i read it in his straining eyes and his twitching features. "what is the question, mr. holmes?" "only this: what did you do with the bodies?" the man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream. he clawed into the air with his bony hands. his mouth was open, and for the instant he looked like some horrible bird of prey. in a flash we got a glimpse of the real josiah amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as his body. as he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his lips as if to stifle a cough. holmes sprang at his throat like a tiger, and twisted his face towards the ground. a white pellet fell from between his gasping lips. "no short cuts, josiah amberley. things must be done decently and in order. what about it, barker?" "i have a cab at the door," said our taciturn companion. "it is only a few hundred yards to the station. we will go together. you can stay here, watson. i shall be back within half an hour." the old colourman had the strength of a lion in that great trunk of his, but he was helpless in the hands of the two experienced man-handlers. wriggling and twisting he was dragged to the waiting cab, and i was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-omened house. in less time than he had named, however, holmes was back, in company with a smart young police inspector. "i've left barker to look after the formalities," said holmes. "you had not met barker, watson. he is my hated rival upon the surrey shore. when you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to complete the picture. he has several good cases to his credit, has he not, inspector?" "he has certainly interfered several times," the inspector answered with reserve. "his methods are irregular, no doubt, like my own. the irregulars are useful sometimes, you know. you, for example, with your compulsory warning about whatever he said being used against him, could never have bluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession." "perhaps not. but we get there all the same, mr. holmes. don't imagine that we had not formed our own views of this case, and that we would not have laid our hands on our man. you will excuse us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use, and so rob us of the credit." "there shall be no such robbery, mackinnon. i assure you that i efface myself from now onwards, and as to barker, he has done nothing save what i told him." the inspector seemed considerably relieved. "that is very handsome of you, mr. holmes. praise or blame can matter little to you, but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin to ask questions." "quite so. but they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow, so it would be as well to have answers. what will you say, for example, when the intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact points were which aroused your suspicion, and finally gave you a certain conviction as to the real facts?" the inspector looked puzzled. "we don't seem to have got any real facts yet, mr. holmes. you say that the prisoner, in the presence of three witnesses, practically confessed, by trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his wife and her lover. what other facts have you?" "have you arranged for a search?" "there are three constables on their way." "then you will soon get the clearest fact of all. the bodies cannot be far away. try the cellars and the garden. it should not take long to dig up the likely places. this house is older than the water-pipes. there must be a disused well somewhere. try your luck there." "but how did you know of it, and how was it done?" "i'll show you first how it was done, and then i will give the explanation which is due to you, and even more to my long-suffering friend here, who has been invaluable throughout. but, first, i would give you an insight into this man's mentality. it is a very unusual one--so much so that i think his destination is more likely to be broadmoor than the scaffold. he has, to a high degree, the sort of mind which one associates with the mediæval italian nature rather than with the modern briton. he was a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any adventurer. such a one came upon the scene in the person of this chess-playing doctor. amberley excelled at chess--one mark, watson, of a scheming mind. like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania. rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. he determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with diabolical cleverness. come here!" holmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had lived in the house, and halted at the open door of the strong-room. "pooh! what an awful smell of paint!" cried the inspector. "that was our first clue," said holmes. "you can thank dr. watson's observation for that, though he failed to draw the inference. it set my foot upon the trail. why should this man at such a time be filling his house with strong odours? obviously, to cover some other smell which he wished to conceal--some guilty smell which would suggest suspicions. then came the idea of a room such as you see here with iron door and shutter--a hermetically sealed room. put those two facts together, and whither do they lead? i could only determine that by examining the house myself. i was already certain that the case was serious, for i had examined the box-office chart at the haymarket theatre--another of dr. watson's bull's-eyes--and ascertained that neither b thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied that night. therefore, amberley had not been to the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. he made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife. the question now arose how i might be able to examine the house. i sent an agent to the most impossible village i could think of, and summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back. to prevent any miscarriage, dr. watson accompanied him. the good vicar's name i took, of course, out of my crockford. do i make it all clear to you?" "it is masterly," said the inspector, in an awed voice. "there being no fear of interruption i proceeded to burgle the house. burglary has always been an alternative profession, had i cared to adopt it, and i have little doubt that i should have come to the front. observe what i found. you see the gas-pipe along the skirting here. very good. it rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here in the corner. the pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see, and ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is concealed by the ornamentation. that end is wide open. at any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas. with door and shutter closed and the tap full on i would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little chamber. by what devilish device he decoyed them there i do not know, but once inside the door they were at his mercy." the inspector examined the pipe with interest. "one of our officers mentioned the smell of gas," said he, "but, of course, the window and door were open then, and the paint--or some of it--was already about. he had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his story. but what next, mr. holmes?" "well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself. i was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when i felt a hand inside my collar, and a voice said: 'now, you rascal, what are you doing in there?' when i could twist my head round i looked into the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival, mr. barker. it was a curious forgathering, and set us both smiling. it seems that he had been engaged by dr. ray ernest's family to make some investigations, and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play. he had watched the house for some days, and had spotted dr. watson as one of the obviously suspicious characters who had called there. he could hardly arrest watson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry window there came a limit to his restraint. of course, i told him how matters stood and we continued the case together." "why him? why not us?" "because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so admirably. i fear you would not have gone so far." the inspector smiled. "well, maybe not. i understand that i have your word, mr. holmes, that you step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results over to us." "certainly, that is always my custom." "well, in the name of the force i thank you. it seems a clear case, as you put it, and there can't be much difficulty over the bodies." "i'll show you a grim little bit of evidence," said holmes, "and i am sure amberley himself never observed it. you'll get results, inspector, by always putting yourself in the other fellow's place, and thinking what you would do yourself. it takes some imagination, but it pays. now, we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room, had not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even with the fiend who was probably mocking at you from the other side of the door. what would you do?" "write a message." "exactly. you would like to tell people how you died. no use writing on paper. that would be seen. if you wrote on the wall some eye might rest upon it. now, look here! just above the skirting is scribbled with a purple indelible pencil: 'we we----' that's all." "what do you make of that?" "well, it's only a foot above the ground. the poor devil was on the floor and dying when he wrote it. he lost his senses before he could finish." "he was writing, 'we were murdered.'" "that's how i read it. if you find an indelible pencil on the body----" "we'll look out for it, you may be sure. but those securities? clearly there was no robbery at all. and yet he _did_ possess those bonds. we verified that." "you may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place. when the whole elopement had passed into history he would suddenly discover them, and announce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder or had dropped it on the way." "you certainly seem to have met every difficulty," said the inspector. "of course, he was bound to call us in, but why he should have gone to you i can't understand." "pure swank!" holmes answered. "he felt so clever and so sure of himself that he imagined no one could touch him. he could say to any suspicious neighbour, 'look at the steps i have taken. i have consulted not only the police, but even sherlock holmes.'" the inspector laughed. "we must forgive you your 'even,' mr. holmes," said he; "it's as workmanlike a job as i can remember." a couple of days later my friend tossed across to me a copy of the bi-weekly _north surrey observer_. under a series of flaming headlines, which began with "the haven horror" and ended with "brilliant police investigation," there was a packed column of print which gave the first consecutive account of the affair. the concluding paragraph is typical of the whole. it ran thus: "the remarkable acumen by which inspector mackinnon deduced from the smell of paint that some other smell, that of gas, for example, might be concealed; the bold deduction that the strongroom might also be the death-chamber, and the subsequent inquiry which led to the discovery of the bodies in a disused well, cleverly concealed by a dog-kennel, should live in the history of crime as a standing example of the intelligence of our professional detectives." "well, well, mackinnon is a good fellow," said holmes, with a tolerant smile. "you can file it in our archives, watson. some day the true story may be told."
﻿ i. silver blaze i am afraid, watson, that i shall have to go,” said holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning. “go! where to?” “to dartmoor; to king’s pyland.” i was not surprised. indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of england. for a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. yet, silent as he was, i knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. there was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the wessex cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. when, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what i had both expected and hoped for. “i should be most happy to go down with you if i should not be in the way,” said i. “my dear watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming. and i think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. we have, i think, just time to catch our train at paddington, and i will go further into the matter upon our journey. you would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.” and so it happened that an hour or so later i found myself in the corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for exeter, while sherlock holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at paddington. we had left reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case. “we are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing at his watch. “our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.” “i have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said i. “nor have i. but the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. i presume that you have looked into this matter of the murder of john straker and the disappearance of silver blaze?” “i have seen what the _telegraph_ and the _chronicle_ have to say.” “it is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. the tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such personal importance to so many people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. the difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. on tuesday evening i received telegrams from both colonel ross, the owner of the horse, and from inspector gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.” “tuesday evening!” i exclaimed. “and this is thursday morning. why didn’t you go down yesterday?” “because i made a blunder, my dear watson—which is, i am afraid, a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your memoirs. the fact is that i could not believe it possible that the most remarkable horse in england could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of dartmoor. from hour to hour yesterday i expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of john straker. when, however, another morning had come, and i found that beyond the arrest of young fitzroy simpson nothing had been done, i felt that it was time for me to take action. yet in some ways i feel that yesterday has not been wasted.” “you have formed a theory, then?” “at least i have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. i shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person, and i can hardly expect your co-operation if i do not show you the position from which we start.” i lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our journey. “silver blaze,” said he, “is from the isonomy stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. he is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to colonel ross, his fortunate owner. up to the time of the catastrophe he was the first favourite for the wessex cup, the betting being three to one on him. he has always, however, been a prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. it is obvious, therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing silver blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next tuesday. “the fact was, of course, appreciated at king’s pyland, where the colonel’s training-stable is situated. every precaution was taken to guard the favourite. the trainer, john straker, is a retired jockey who rode in colonel ross’s colours before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair. he has served the colonel for five years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant. under him were three lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four horses in all. one of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. all three bore excellent characters. john straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables. he has no children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. the country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure dartmoor air. tavistock itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of mapleton, which belongs to lord backwater, and is managed by silas brown. in every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. such was the general situation last monday night when the catastrophe occurred. “on that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. two of the lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, ned hunter, remained on guard. at a few minutes after nine the maid, edith baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. she took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. the maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path ran across the open moor. “edith baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. as he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. he wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. she was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. his age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it. “‘can you tell me where i am?’ he asked. ‘i had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor, when i saw the light of your lantern.’ “‘you are close to the king’s pyland training-stables,’ said she. “‘oh, indeed! what a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘i understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. now i am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?’ he took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. ‘see that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’ “she was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. it was already opened, and hunter was seated at the small table inside. she had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again. “‘good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘i wanted to have a word with you.’ the girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand. “‘what business have you here?’ asked the lad. “‘it’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said the other. ‘you’ve two horses in for the wessex cup—silver blaze and bayard. let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a loser. is it a fact that at the weights bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?’ “‘so, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘i’ll show you how we serve them in king’s pyland.’ he sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. the girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. a minute later, however, when hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.” “one moment,” i asked. “did the stable-boy, when he ran out with the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?” “excellent, watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “the importance of the point struck me so forcibly that i sent a special wire to dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. the boy locked the door before he left it. the window, i may add, was not large enough for a man to get through. “hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true significance. it left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and mrs. straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. in reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. she begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house. “mrs. straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet returned. she dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for the stables. the door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer. “the two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly aroused. they had heard nothing during the night, for they are both sound sleepers. hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. they still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy. “about a quarter of a mile from the stables john straker’s overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. his head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. it was clear, however, that straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables. “hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. he was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman. “as to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the struggle. but from that morning he has disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of him. finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect. “those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. i shall now recapitulate what the police have done in the matter. “inspector gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely competent officer. were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession. on his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. there was little difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited one of those villas which i have mentioned. his name, it appears, was fitzroy simpson. he was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in the sporting clubs of london. an examination of his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favourite. “on being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come down to dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the king’s pyland horses, and also about desborough, the second favourite, which was in charge of silas brown at the mapleton stables. he did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand information. when confronted with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. his wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which was a penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed. “on the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of straker’s knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear his mark upon him. there you have it all in a nutshell, watson, and if you can give me any light i shall be infinitely obliged to you.” i had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. though most of the facts were familiar to me, i had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to each other. “is it not possible,” i suggested, “that the incised wound upon straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?” “it is more than possible; it is probable,” said holmes. “in that case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.” “and yet,” said i, “even now i fail to understand what the theory of the police can be.” “i am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it,” returned my companion. “the police imagine, i take it, that this fitzroy simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. his bridle is missing, so that simpson must have put this on. then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. a row naturally ensued. simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which straker used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. that is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are more improbable still. however, i shall very quickly test the matter when i am once upon the spot, and until then i cannot really see how we can get much further than our present position.” it was evening before we reached the little town of tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of dartmoor. two gentlemen were awaiting us in the station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. the latter was colonel ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, inspector gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the english detective service. “i am delighted that you have come down, mr. holmes,” said the colonel. “the inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but i wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor straker and in recovering my horse.” “have there been any fresh developments?” asked holmes. “i am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said the inspector. “we have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.” a minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were rattling through the quaint old devonshire city. inspector gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. colonel ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while i listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what holmes had foretold in the train. “the net is drawn pretty close round fitzroy simpson,” he remarked, “and i believe myself that he is our man. at the same time i recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.” “how about straker’s knife?” “we have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.” “my friend dr. watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. if so, it would tell against this man simpson.” “undoubtedly. he has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. the evidence against him is certainly very strong. he had a great interest in the disappearance of the favourite. he lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man’s hand. i really think we have enough to go before a jury.” holmes shook his head. “a clever counsel would tear it all to rags,” said he. “why should he take the horse out of the stable? if he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? has a duplicate key been found in his possession? what chemist sold him the powdered opium? above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? what is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?” “he says that it was a ten-pound note. one was found in his purse. but your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. he is not a stranger to the district. he has twice lodged at tavistock in the summer. the opium was probably brought from london. the key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away. the horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.” “what does he say about the cravat?” “he acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. but a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable.” holmes pricked up his ears. “we have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. on tuesday they were gone. now, presuming that there was some understanding between simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?” “it is certainly possible.” “the moor is being scoured for these gypsies. i have also examined every stable and out-house in tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.” “there is another training-stable quite close, i understand?” “yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. as desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. silas brown, the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor straker. we have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.” “and nothing to connect this man simpson with the interests of the mapleton stables?” “nothing at all.” holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased. a few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road. some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled out-building. in every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the mapleton stables. we all sprang out with the exception of holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. it was only when i touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage. “excuse me,” said he, turning to colonel ross, who had looked at him in some surprise. “i was day-dreaming.” there was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as i was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though i could not imagine where he had found it. “perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, mr. holmes?” said gregory. “i think that i should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. straker was brought back here, i presume?” “yes; he lies upstairs. the inquest is to-morrow.” “he has been in your service some years, colonel ross?” “i have always found him an excellent servant.” “i presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, inspector?” “i have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care to see them.” “i should be very glad.” we all filed into the front room and sat round the central table while the inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a small heap of things before us. there was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an a.d.p. briar-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked weiss & co., london. “this is a very singular knife,” said holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely. “i presume, as i see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp. watson, this knife is surely in your line?” “it is what we call a cataract knife,” said i. “i thought so. a very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. a strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.” “the tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,” said the inspector. “his wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. it was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment.” “very possible. how about these papers?” “three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. one of them is a letter of instructions from colonel ross. this other is a milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by madame lesurier, of bond street, to william derbyshire. mrs. straker tells us that derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.” “madam derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked holmes, glancing down the account. “twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume. however there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.” as we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the inspector’s sleeve. her face was haggard and thin and eager, stamped with the print of a recent horror. “have you got them? have you found them?” she panted. “no, mrs. straker. but mr. holmes here has come from london to help us, and we shall do all that is possible.” “surely i met you in plymouth at a garden-party some little time ago, mrs. straker?” said holmes. “no, sir; you are mistaken.” “dear me! why, i could have sworn to it. you wore a costume of dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.” “i never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady. “ah, that quite settles it,” said holmes. and with an apology he followed the inspector outside. a short walk across the moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been found. at the brink of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung. “there was no wind that night, i understand,” said holmes. “none; but very heavy rain.” “in that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush, but placed there.” “yes, it was laid across the bush.” “you fill me with interest, i perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal. no doubt many feet have been here since monday night.” “a piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all stood upon that.” “excellent.” “in this bag i have one of the boots which straker wore, one of fitzroy simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of silver blaze.” “my dear inspector, you surpass yourself!” holmes took the bag, and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central position. then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. “hullo!” said he, suddenly. “what’s this?” it was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood. “i cannot think how i came to overlook it,” said the inspector, with an expression of annoyance. “it was invisible, buried in the mud. i only saw it because i was looking for it.” “what! you expected to find it?” “i thought it not unlikely.” he took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of each of them with marks upon the ground. then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and bushes. “i am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the inspector. “i have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.” “indeed!” said holmes, rising. “i should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say. but i should like to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that i may know my ground to-morrow, and i think that i shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.” colonel ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. “i wish you would come back with me, inspector,” said he. “there are several points on which i should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse’s name from the entries for the cup.” “certainly not,” cried holmes, with decision. “i should let the name stand.” the colonel bowed. “i am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,” said he. “you will find us at poor straker’s house when you have finished your walk, and we can drive together into tavistock.” he turned back with the inspector, while holmes and i walked slowly across the moor. the sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. but the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought. “it’s this way, watson,” said he at last. “we may leave the question of who killed john straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to? the horse is a very gregarious creature. if left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to king’s pyland or go over to mapleton. why should he run wild upon the moor? he would surely have been seen by now. and why should gypsies kidnap him? these people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. they could not hope to sell such a horse. they would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. surely that is clear.” “where is he, then?” “i have already said that he must have gone to king’s pyland or to mapleton. he is not at king’s pyland. therefore he is at mapleton. let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. this part of the moor, as the inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. but it falls away towards mapleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on monday night. if our supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.” we had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. at holmes’ request i walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but i had not taken fifty paces before i heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. the track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression. “see the value of imagination,” said holmes. “it is the one quality which gregory lacks. we imagined what might have happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified. let us proceed.” we crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. again the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to mapleton. it was holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face. a man’s track was visible beside the horse’s. “the horse was alone before,” i cried. “quite so. it was alone before. hullo, what is this?” the double track turned sharp off and took the direction of king’s pyland. holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. his eyes were on the trail, but i happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction. “one for you, watson,” said holmes, when i pointed it out. “you have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on our own traces. let us follow the return track.” we had not to go far. it ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates of the mapleton stables. as we approached, a groom ran out from them. “we don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he. “i only wished to ask a question,” said holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “should i be too early to see your master, mr. silas brown, if i were to call at five o’clock to-morrow morning?” “bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring. but here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. no, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money. afterwards, if you like.” as sherlock holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. “what’s this, dawson!” he cried. “no gossiping! go about your business! and you, what the devil do you want here?” “ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said holmes in the sweetest of voices. “i’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. we want no strangers here. be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.” holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s ear. he started violently and flushed to the temples. “it’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!” “very good. shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlour?” “oh, come in if you wish to.” holmes smiled. “i shall not keep you more than a few minutes, watson,” said he. “now, mr. brown, i am quite at your disposal.” it was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys before holmes and the trainer reappeared. never have i seen such a change as had been brought about in silas brown in that short time. his face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. his bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog with its master. “your instructions will be done. it shall all be done,” said he. “there must be no mistake,” said holmes, looking round at him. the other winced as he read the menace in his eyes. “oh no, there shall be no mistake. it shall be there. should i change it first or not?” holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “no, don’t,” said he; “i shall write to you about it. no tricks, now, or—” “oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!” “yes, i think i can. well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” he turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to him, and we set off for king’s pyland. “a more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than master silas brown i have seldom met with,” remarked holmes as we trudged along together. “he has the horse, then?” “he tried to bluster out of it, but i described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that i was watching him. of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. again, of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing. i described to him how, when according to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor. how he went out to it, and his astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. then i described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to king’s pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at mapleton. when i told him every detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.” “but his stables had been searched?” “oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.” “but are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?” “my dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. he knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.” “colonel ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy in any case.” “the matter does not rest with colonel ross. i follow my own methods, and tell as much or as little as i choose. that is the advantage of being unofficial. i don’t know whether you observed it, watson, but the colonel’s manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. i am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense. say nothing to him about the horse.” “certainly not without your permission.” “and of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the question of who killed john straker.” “and you will devote yourself to that?” “on the contrary, we both go back to london by the night train.” i was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. we had only been a few hours in devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. not a word more could i draw from him until we were back at the trainer’s house. the colonel and the inspector were awaiting us in the parlour. “my friend and i return to town by the night-express,” said holmes. “we have had a charming little breath of your beautiful dartmoor air.” the inspector opened his eyes, and the colonel’s lip curled in a sneer. “so you despair of arresting the murderer of poor straker,” said he. holmes shrugged his shoulders. “there are certainly grave difficulties in the way,” said he. “i have every hope, however, that your horse will start upon tuesday, and i beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. might i ask for a photograph of mr. john straker?” the inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him. “my dear gregory, you anticipate all my wants. if i might ask you to wait here for an instant, i have a question which i should like to put to the maid.” “i must say that i am rather disappointed in our london consultant,” said colonel ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room. “i do not see that we are any further than when he came.” “at least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said i. “yes, i have his assurance,” said the colonel, with a shrug of his shoulders. “i should prefer to have the horse.” i was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he entered the room again. “now, gentlemen,” said he, “i am quite ready for tavistock.” as we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the door open for us. a sudden idea seemed to occur to holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve. “you have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “who attends to them?” “i do, sir.” “have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?” “well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.” i could see that holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together. “a long shot, watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my arm. “gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep. drive on, coachman!” colonel ross still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but i saw by the inspector’s face that his attention had been keenly aroused. “you consider that to be important?” he asked. “exceedingly so.” “is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” “to the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.” “the dog did nothing in the night-time.” “that was the curious incident,” remarked sherlock holmes. four days later holmes and i were again in the train, bound for winchester to see the race for the wessex cup. colonel ross met us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the town. his face was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme. “i have seen nothing of my horse,” said he. “i suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked holmes. the colonel was very angry. “i have been on the turf for twenty years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said he. “a child would know silver blaze, with his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.” “how is the betting?” “well, that is the curious part of it. you could have got fifteen to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly get three to one now.” “hum!” said holmes. “somebody knows something, that is clear.” as the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand i glanced at the card to see the entries. it ran:— wessex plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and five year olds. second, £300. third, £200. new course (one mile and five furlongs). 1. mr. heath newton’s the negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket). 2. colonel wardlaw’s pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket). 3. lord backwater’s desborough (yellow cap and sleeves). 4. colonel ross’s silver blaze (black cap, red jacket). 5. duke of balmoral’s iris (yellow and black stripes). 6. lord singleford’s rasper (purple cap, black sleeves). “we scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,” said the colonel. “why, what is that? silver blaze favourite?” “five to four against silver blaze!” roared the ring. “five to four against silver blaze! five to fifteen against desborough! five to four on the field!” “there are the numbers up,” i cried. “they are all six there.” “all six there? then my horse is running,” cried the colonel in great agitation. “but i don’t see him. my colours have not passed.” “only five have passed. this must be he.” as i spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of the colonel. “that’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “that beast has not a white hair upon its body. what is this that you have done, mr. holmes?” “well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend, imperturbably. for a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. “capital! an excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “there they are, coming round the curve!” from our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. the six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half way up the yellow of the mapleton stable showed to the front. before they reached us, however, desborough’s bolt was shot, and the colonel’s horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the duke of balmoral’s iris making a bad third. “it’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the colonel, passing his hand over his eyes. “i confess that i can make neither head nor tail of it. don’t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, mr. holmes?” “certainly, colonel, you shall know everything. let us all go round and have a look at the horse together. here he is,” he continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where only owners and their friends find admittance. “you have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find that he is the same old silver blaze as ever.” “you take my breath away!” “i found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over.” “my dear sir, you have done wonders. the horse looks very fit and well. it never went better in its life. i owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability. you have done me a great service by recovering my horse. you would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of john straker.” “i have done so,” said holmes quietly. the colonel and i stared at him in amazement. “you have got him! where is he, then?” “he is here.” “here! where?” “in my company at the present moment.” the colonel flushed angrily. “i quite recognise that i am under obligations to you, mr. holmes,” said he, “but i must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.” sherlock holmes laughed. “i assure you that i have not associated you with the crime, colonel,” said he. “the real murderer is standing immediately behind you.” he stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred. “the horse!” cried both the colonel and myself. “yes, the horse. and it may lessen his guilt if i say that it was done in self-defence, and that john straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence. but there goes the bell, and as i stand to win a little on this next race, i shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.” we had the corner of a pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to london, and i fancy that the journey was a short one to colonel ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion’s narrative of the events which had occurred at the dartmoor training-stables upon the monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them. “i confess,” said he, “that any theories which i had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. and yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. i went to devonshire with the conviction that fitzroy simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, i saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete. it was while i was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. you may remember that i was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. i was marvelling in my own mind how i could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.” “i confess,” said the colonel, “that even now i cannot see how it helps us.” “it was the first link in my chain of reasoning. powdered opium is by no means tasteless. the flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. a curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. by no possible supposition could this stranger, fitzroy simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour. that is unthinkable. therefore simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. the opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects. which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them? “before deciding that question i had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. the simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. obviously the midnight visitor was some one whom the dog knew well. “i was already convinced, or almost convinced, that john straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out silver blaze. for what purpose? for a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable-boy? and yet i was at a loss to know why. there have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by fraud. sometimes it is a pulling jockey. sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. what was it here? i hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion. “and they did so. you cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon. it was, as dr. watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. and it was to be used for a delicate operation that night. you must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, colonel ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. a horse so treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.” “villain! scoundrel!” cried the colonel. “we have here the explanation of why john straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor. so spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. it was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.” “i have been blind!” cried the colonel. “of course that was why he needed the candle, and struck the match.” “undoubtedly. but in examining his belongings i was fortunate enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. as a man of the world, colonel, you know that men do not carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. we have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. i at once concluded that straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment. the nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. liberal as you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. i questioned mrs. straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, i made a note of the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with straker’s photograph i could easily dispose of the mythical derbyshire. “from that time on all was plain. straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible. simpson in his flight had dropped his cravat, and straker had picked it up—with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s leg. once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck straker full on the forehead. he had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. do i make it clear?” “wonderful!” cried the colonel. “wonderful! you might have been there!” “my final shot was, i confess a very long one. it struck me that so astute a man as straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice. what could he practice on? my eyes fell upon the sheep, and i asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct. “when i returned to london i called upon the milliner, who had recognised straker as an excellent customer of the name of derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. i have no doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this miserable plot.” “you have explained all but one thing,” cried the colonel. “where was the horse?” “ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. we must have an amnesty in that direction, i think. this is clapham junction, if i am not mistaken, and we shall be in victoria in less than ten minutes. if you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms, colonel, i shall be happy to give you any other details which might interest you.” ii. the adventure of the cardboard box in choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, sherlock holmes, i have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents. it is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice, has provided him with. with this short preface i shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events. it was a blazing hot day in august. baker street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye. it was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. our blinds were half-drawn, and holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. for myself, my term of service in india had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. but the morning paper was uninteresting. parliament had risen. everybody was out of town, and i yearned for the glades of the new forest or the shingle of southsea. a depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country. finding that holmes was too absorbed for conversation i had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair i fell into a brown study. suddenly my companion’s voice broke in upon my thoughts: “you are right, watson,” said he. “it does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.” “most preposterous!” i exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, i sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement. “what is this, holmes?” i cried. “this is beyond anything which i could have imagined.” he laughed heartily at my perplexity. “you remember,” he said, “that some little time ago when i read you the passage in one of poe’s sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere _tour-de-force_ of the author. on my remarking that i was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.” “oh, no!” “perhaps not with your tongue, my dear watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. so when i saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, i was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that i had been in rapport with you.” but i was still far from satisfied. “in the example which you read to me,” said i, “the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. if i remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. but i have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can i have given you?” “you do yourself an injustice. the features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.” “do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?” “your features and especially your eyes. perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?” “no, i cannot.” “then i will tell you. after throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of general gordon, and i saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. but it did not lead very far. your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which stands upon the top of your books. then you glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. you were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with gordon’s picture over there.” “you have followed me wonderfully!” i exclaimed. “so far i could hardly have gone astray. but now your thoughts went back to beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. you were recalling the incidents of beecher’s career. i was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the north at the time of the civil war, for i remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. you felt so strongly about it that i knew you could not think of beecher without thinking of that also. when a moment later i saw your eyes wander away from the picture, i suspected that your mind had now turned to the civil war, and when i observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched i was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. but then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. at this point i agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.” “absolutely!” said i. “and now that you have explained it, i confess that i am as amazed as before.” “it was very superficial, my dear watson, i assure you. i should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. but i have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading. have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to miss cushing, of cross street, croydon?” “no, i saw nothing.” “ah! then you must have overlooked it. just toss it over to me. here it is, under the financial column. perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud.” i picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the paragraph indicated. it was headed, “a gruesome packet.” “miss susan cushing, living at cross street, croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. at two o’clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. a cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. on emptying this, miss cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. the box had been sent by parcel post from belfast upon the morning before. there is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as miss cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. some years ago, however, when she resided at penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. the police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon miss cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of ireland, and, to the best of miss cushing’s belief, from belfast. in the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, mr. lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.” “so much for the _daily chronicle_,” said holmes as i finished reading. “now for our friend lestrade. i had a note from him this morning, in which he says: ‘i think that this case is very much in your line. we have every hope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. we have, of course, wired to the belfast post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the sender. the box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way. the medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare i should be very happy to see you out here. i shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day.’ what say you, watson? can you rise superior to the heat and run down to croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?” “i was longing for something to do.” “you shall have it then. ring for our boots and tell them to order a cab. i’ll be back in a moment when i have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.” a shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far less oppressive in croydon than in town. holmes had sent on a wire, so that lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. a walk of five minutes took us to cross street, where miss cushing resided. it was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping at the doors. halfway down, lestrade stopped and tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. miss cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. she was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. a worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her. “they are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,” said she as lestrade entered. “i wish that you would take them away altogether.” “so i shall, miss cushing. i only kept them here until my friend, mr. holmes, should have seen them in your presence.” “why in my presence, sir?” “in case he wished to ask any questions.” “what is the use of asking me questions when i tell you i know nothing whatever about it?” “quite so, madam,” said holmes in his soothing way. “i have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.” “indeed, i have, sir. i am a quiet woman and live a retired life. it is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the police in my house. i won’t have those things in here, mr. lestrade. if you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.” it was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house. lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece of brown paper and some string. there was a bench at the end of the path, and we all sat down while holmes examined, one by one, the articles which lestrade had handed to him. “the string is exceedingly interesting,” he remarked, holding it up to the light and sniffing at it. “what do you make of this string, lestrade?” “it has been tarred.” “precisely. it is a piece of tarred twine. you have also, no doubt, remarked that miss cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. this is of importance.” “i cannot see the importance,” said lestrade. “the importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar character.” “it is very neatly tied. i had already made a note to that effect,” said lestrade complacently. “so much for the string, then,” said holmes, smiling, “now for the box wrapper. brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. what, did you not observe it? i think there can be no doubt of it. address printed in rather straggling characters: ‘miss s. cushing, cross street, croydon.’ done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a j, and with very inferior ink. the word ‘croydon’ has been originally spelled with an ‘i,’ which has been changed to ‘y.’ the parcel was directed, then, by a man—the printing is distinctly masculine—of limited education and unacquainted with the town of croydon. so far, so good! the box is a yellow half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb marks at the left bottom corner. it is filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser commercial purposes. and embedded in it are these very singular enclosures.” he took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his knee he examined them minutely, while lestrade and i, bending forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion. finally he returned them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation. “you have observed, of course,” said he at last, “that the ears are not a pair.” “yes, i have noticed that. but if this were the practical joke of some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair.” “precisely. but this is not a practical joke.” “you are sure of it?” “the presumption is strongly against it. bodies in the dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. these ears bear no signs of this. they are fresh, too. they have been cut off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it. again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt. i repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious crime.” a vague thrill ran through me as i listened to my companion’s words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. this brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background. lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is only half convinced. “there are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,” said he, “but there are much stronger reasons against the other. we know that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at penge and here for the last twenty years. she has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time. why on earth, then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?” “that is the problem which we have to solve,” holmes answered, “and for my part i shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been committed. one of these ears is a woman’s, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring. the other is a man’s, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. these two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before now. to-day is friday. the packet was posted on thursday morning. the tragedy, then, occurred on wednesday or tuesday or earlier. if the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would have sent this sign of his work to miss cushing? we may take it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. but he must have some strong reason for sending miss cushing this packet. what reason then? it must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. but in that case she knows who it is. does she know? i doubt it. if she knew, why should she call the police in? she might have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. that is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal. but if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name. there is a tangle here which needs straightening out.” he had been talking in a high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house. “i have a few questions to ask miss cushing,” said he. “in that case i may leave you here,” said lestrade, “for i have another small business on hand. i think that i have nothing further to learn from miss cushing. you will find me at the police-station.” “we shall look in on our way to the train,” answered holmes. a moment later he and i were back in the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. she put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes. “i am convinced, sir,” she said, “that this matter is a mistake, and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. i have said this several times to the gentleman from scotland yard, but he simply laughs at me. i have not an enemy in the world, as far as i know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?” “i am coming to be of the same opinion, miss cushing,” said holmes, taking a seat beside her. “i think that it is more than probable——” he paused, and i was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady’s profile. surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. i stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but i could see nothing which could account for my companion’s evident excitement. “there were one or two questions——” “oh, i am weary of questions!” cried miss cushing impatiently. “you have two sisters, i believe.” “how could you know that?” “i observed the very instant that i entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship.” “yes, you are quite right. those are my sisters, sarah and mary.” “and here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at liverpool, of your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by his uniform. i observe that she was unmarried at the time.” “you are very quick at observing.” “that is my trade.” “well, you are quite right. but she was married to mr. browner a few days afterwards. he was on the south american line when that was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn’t abide to leave her for so long, and he got into the liverpool and london boats.” “ah, the _conqueror_, perhaps?” “no, the _may day_, when last i heard. jim came down here to see me once. that was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him stark, staring mad. ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his hand again. first he dropped me, then he quarrelled with sarah, and now that mary has stopped writing we don’t know how things are going with them.” it was evident that miss cushing had come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply. like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative. she told us many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and those of their hospitals. holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in a question from time to time. “about your second sister, sarah,” said he. “i wonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.” “ah! you don’t know sarah’s temper or you would wonder no more. i tried it when i came to croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago, when we had to part. i don’t want to say a word against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was sarah.” “you say that she quarrelled with your liverpool relations.” “yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. why, she went up there to live in order to be near them. and now she has no word hard enough for jim browner. the last six months that she was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways. he had caught her meddling, i suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was the start of it.” “thank you, miss cushing,” said holmes, rising and bowing. “your sister sarah lives, i think you said, at new street wallington? good-bye, and i am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.” there was a cab passing as we came out, and holmes hailed it. “how far to wallington?” he asked. “only about a mile, sir.” “very good. jump in, watson. we must strike while the iron is hot. simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive details in connection with it. just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass, cabby.” holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his face. our driver pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted. my companion ordered him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step. “is miss cushing at home?” asked holmes. “miss sarah cushing is extremely ill,” said he. “she has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. as her medical adviser, i cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her. i should recommend you to call again in ten days.” he drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street. “well, if we can’t we can’t,” said holmes, cheerfully. “perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.” “i did not wish her to tell me anything. i only wanted to look at her. however, i think that i have got all that i want. drive us to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend lestrade at the police-station.” we had a pleasant little meal together, during which holmes would talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had purchased his own stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred guineas, at a jew broker’s in tottenham court road for fifty-five shillings. this led him to paganini, and we sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man. the afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the police-station. lestrade was waiting for us at the door. “a telegram for you, mr. holmes,” said he. “ha! it is the answer!” he tore it open, glanced his eyes over it, and crumpled it into his pocket. “that’s all right,” said he. “have you found out anything?” “i have found out everything!” “what!” lestrade stared at him in amazement. “you are joking.” “i was never more serious in my life. a shocking crime has been committed, and i think i have now laid bare every detail of it.” “and the criminal?” holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to lestrade. “that is the name,” he said. “you cannot effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest. i should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case, as i choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution. come on, watson.” we strode off together to the station, leaving lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the card which holmes had thrown him. “the case,” said sherlock holmes as we chatted over our cigars that night in our rooms at baker street, “is one where, as in the investigations which you have chronicled under the names of ‘a study in scarlet’ and of ‘the sign of four,’ we have been compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. i have written to lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has secured his man. that he may be safely trusted to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and, indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at scotland yard.” “your case is not complete, then?” i asked. “it is fairly complete in essentials. we know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. of course, you have formed your own conclusions.” “i presume that this jim browner, the steward of a liverpool boat, is the man whom you suspect?” “oh! it is more than a suspicion.” “and yet i cannot see anything save very vague indications.” “on the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. let me run over the principal steps. we approached the case, you remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage. we had formed no theories. we were simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations. what did we see first? a very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters. it instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for one of these. i set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our leisure. then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box. “the string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our investigation. when i observed that the knot was one which is popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among sailors than landsmen, i was quite certain that all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes. “when i came to examine the address of the packet i observed that it was to miss s. cushing. now, the oldest sister would, of course, be miss cushing, and although her initial was ‘s’ it might belong to one of the others as well. in that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether. i therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up this point. i was about to assure miss cushing that i was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that i came suddenly to a stop. the fact was that i had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely. “as a medical man, you are aware, watson, that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear. each ear is as a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. in last year’s _anthropological journal_ you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject. i had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at miss cushing i perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which i had just inspected. the matter was entirely beyond coincidence. there was the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. in all essentials it was the same ear. “of course i at once saw the enormous importance of the observation. it was evident that the victim was a blood relation and probably a very close one. i began to talk to her about her family, and you remember that she at once gave us some exceedingly valuable details. “in the first place, her sister’s name was sarah, and her address had until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had at one time been so intimate with miss sarah that she had actually gone up to liverpool to be near the browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. this quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if browner had occasion to address a packet to miss sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address. “and now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully. we had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong passions—you remember that he threw up what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife—subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. we had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a man—presumably a seafaring man—had been murdered at the same time. jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime. and why should these proofs of the deed be sent to miss sarah cushing? probably because during her residence in liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which led to the tragedy. you will observe that this line of boats calls at belfast, dublin, and waterford; so that, presuming that browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the _may day_, belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet. “a second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although i thought it exceedingly unlikely, i was determined to elucidate it before going further. an unsuccessful lover might have killed mr. and mrs. browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband. there were many grave objections to this theory, but it was conceivable. i therefore sent off a telegram to my friend algar, of the liverpool force, and asked him to find out if mrs. browner were at home, and if browner had departed in the _may day_. then we went on to wallington to visit miss sarah. “i was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had been reproduced in her. then, of course, she might give us very important information, but i was not sanguine that she would. she must have heard of the business the day before, since all croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the packet was meant. if she had been willing to help justice she would probably have communicated with the police already. however, it was clearly our duty to see her, so we went. we found that the news of the arrival of the packet—for her illness dated from that time—had such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever. it was clearer than ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her. “however, we were really independent of her help. our answers were waiting for us at the police-station, where i had directed algar to send them. nothing could be more conclusive. mrs. browner’s house had been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives. it had been ascertained at the shipping offices that browner had left aboard of the _may day_, and i calculate that she is due in the thames to-morrow night. when he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute lestrade, and i have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.” sherlock holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. two days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from the detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several pages of foolscap. “lestrade has got him all right,” said holmes, glancing up at me. “perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says. “my dear mr. holmes,—in accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our theories”—“the ‘we’ is rather fine, watson, is it not?”—“i went down to the albert dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the s.s. _may day_, belonging to the liverpool, dublin, and london steam packet company. on inquiry, i found that there was a steward on board of the name of james browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties. on descending to his berth, i found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro. he is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy— something like aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair. he jumped up when he heard my business, and i had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies. we brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. however, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man. we had three copies typewritten, one of which i enclose. the affair proves, as i always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but i am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. with kind regards, yours very truly,—g. lestrade.” “hum! the investigation really was a very simple one,” remarked holmes, “but i don’t think it struck him in that light when he first called us in. however, let us see what jim browner has to say for himself. this is his statement as made before inspector montgomery at the shadwell police station, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.” “have i anything to say? yes, i have a deal to say. i have to make a clean breast of it all. you can hang me, or you can leave me alone. i don’t care a plug which you do. i tell you i’ve not shut an eye in sleep since i did it, and i don’t believe i ever will again until i get past all waking. sometimes it’s his face, but most generally it’s hers. i’m never without one or the other before me. he looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind o’ surprise upon her face. ay, the white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before. “but it was sarah’s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! it’s not that i want to clear myself. i know that i went back to drink, like the beast that i was. but she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our door. for sarah cushing loved me—that’s the root of the business—she loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that i thought more of my wife’s footmark in the mud than i did of her whole body and soul. “there were three sisters altogether. the old one was just a good woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. sarah was thirty-three, and mary was twenty-nine when i married. we were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all liverpool there was no better woman than my mary. and then we asked sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just one of ourselves. “i was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. my god, whoever would have thought that it could have come to this? whoever would have dreamed it? “i used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the ship were held back for cargo i would have a whole week at a time, and in this way i saw a deal of my sister-in-law, sarah. she was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. but when little mary was there i had never a thought of her, and that i swear as i hope for god’s mercy. “it had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but i had never thought anything of that. but one evening my eyes were opened. i had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but sarah at home. ‘where’s mary?’ i asked. ‘oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.’ i was impatient and paced up and down the room. ‘can’t you be happy for five minutes without mary, jim?’ says she. ‘it’s a bad compliment to me that you can’t be contented with my society for so short a time.’ ‘that’s all right, my lass,’ said i, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. i looked into her eyes and i read it all there. there was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. i frowned and drew my hand away. then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder. ‘steady old jim!’ said she, and with a kind o’ mocking laugh, she ran out of the room. “well, from that time sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. i was a fool to let her go on biding with us—a besotted fool—but i never said a word to mary, for i knew it would grieve her. things went on much as before, but after a time i began to find that there was a bit of a change in mary herself. she had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to know where i had been and what i had been doing, and whom my letters were from, and what i had in my pockets, and a thousand such follies. day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing. i was fairly puzzled by it all. sarah avoided me now, but she and mary were just inseparable. i can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife’s mind against me, but i was such a blind beetle that i could not understand it at the time. then i broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but i think i should not have done it if mary had been the same as ever. she had some reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began to be wider and wider. and then this alec fairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker. “it was to see sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends wherever he went. he was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen. he was good company, i won’t deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that i think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle. for a month he was in and out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft, tricky ways. and then at last something made me suspect, and from that day my peace was gone forever. “it was only a little thing, too. i had come into the parlour unexpected, and as i walked in at the door i saw a light of welcome on my wife’s face. but as she saw who it was it faded again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. that was enough for me. there was no one but alec fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine. if i could have seen him then i should have killed him, for i have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose. mary saw the devil’s light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. ‘don’t, jim, don’t!’ says she. ‘where’s sarah?’ i asked. ‘in the kitchen,’ says she. ‘sarah,’ says i as i went in, ‘this man fairbairn is never to darken my door again.’ ‘why not?’ says she. ‘because i order it.’ ‘oh!’ says she, ‘if my friends are not good enough for this house, then i am not good enough for it either.’ ‘you can do what you like,’ says i, ‘but if fairbairn shows his face here again i’ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.’ she was frightened by my face, i think, for she never answered a word, and the same evening she left my house. “well, i don’t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. anyway, she took a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors. fairbairn used to stay there, and mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him. how often she went i don’t know, but i followed her one day, and as i broke in at the door fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he was. i swore to my wife that i would kill her if i found her in his company again, and i led her back with me, sobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. there was no trace of love between us any longer. i could see that she hated me and feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she despised me as well. “well, sarah found that she could not make a living in liverpool, so she went back, as i understand, to live with her sister in croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. and then came this last week and all the misery and ruin. “it was in this way. we had gone on the _may day_ for a round voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve hours. i left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon. the thought was in my head as i turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as i stood watching them from the footpath. “i tell you, and i give you my word for it, that from that moment i was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when i look back on it. i had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together fairly turned my brain. there’s something throbbing in my head now, like a docker’s hammer, but that morning i seemed to have all niagara whizzing and buzzing in my ears. “well, i took to my heels, and i ran after the cab. i had a heavy oak stick in my hand, and i tell you i saw red from the first; but as i ran i got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being seen. they pulled up soon at the railway station. there was a good crowd round the booking-office, so i got quite close to them without being seen. they took tickets for new brighton. so did i, but i got in three carriages behind them. when we reached it they walked along the parade, and i was never more than a hundred yards from them. at last i saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water. “it was just as if they had been given into my hands. there was a bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards. i hired a boat for myself, and i pulled after them. i could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as i, and they must have been a long mile from the shore before i caught them up. the haze was like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle of it. my god, shall i ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that was closing in upon them? she screamed out. he swore like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes. i got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed his head like an egg. i would have spared her, perhaps, for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and calling him ‘alec.’ i struck again, and she lay stretched beside him. i was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood. if sarah had been there, by the lord, she should have joined them. i pulled out my knife, and—well, there! i’ve said enough. it gave me a kind of savage joy when i thought how sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her meddling had brought about. then i tied the bodies into the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. i knew very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in the haze, and had drifted off out to sea. i cleaned myself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed. that night i made up the packet for sarah cushing, and next day i sent it from belfast. “there you have the whole truth of it. you can hang me, or do what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as i have been punished already. i cannot shut my eyes but i see those two faces staring at me—staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze. i killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if i have another night of it i shall be either mad or dead before morning. you won’t put me alone into a cell, sir? for pity’s sake don’t, and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.’ “what is the meaning of it, watson?” said holmes solemnly as he laid down the paper. “what object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear? it must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. but what end? there is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever.” iii. the yellow face in publishing these short sketches based upon the numerous cases in which my companion’s singular gifts have made us the listeners to, and eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only natural that i should dwell rather upon his successes than upon his failures. and this not so much for the sake of his reputation—for, indeed, it was when he was at his wits’ end that his energy and his versatility were most admirable—but because where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left forever without a conclusion. now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth was still discovered. i have noted of some half-dozen cases of the kind, of which the affair of the second stain and that which i am now about to recount are the two which present the strongest features of interest. sherlock holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise’s sake. few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that i have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save when there was some professional object to be served. then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. that he should have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge of austerity. save for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting. one day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk with me in the park, where the first faint shoots of green were breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold leaves. for two hours we rambled about together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. it was nearly five before we were back in baker street once more. “beg pardon, sir,” said our page-boy, as he opened the door. “there’s been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.” holmes glanced reproachfully at me. “so much for afternoon walks!” said he. “has this gentleman gone, then?” “yes, sir.” “didn’t you ask him in?” “yes, sir; he came in.” “how long did he wait?” “half an hour, sir. he was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin’ and a-stampin’ all the time he was here. i was waitin’ outside the door, sir, and i could hear him. at last he outs into the passage, and he cries, ‘is that man never goin’ to come?’ those were his very words, sir. ‘you’ll only need to wait a little longer,’ says i. ‘then i’ll wait in the open air, for i feel half choked,’ says he. ‘i’ll be back before long.’ and with that he ups and he outs, and all i could say wouldn’t hold him back.” “well, well, you did your best,” said holmes, as we walked into our room. “it’s very annoying, though, watson. i was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man’s impatience, as if it were of importance. halloa! that’s not your pipe on the table. he must have left his behind him. a nice old briar with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. i wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in london. some people think that a fly in it is a sign. well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.” “how do you know that he values it highly?” i asked. “well, i should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence. now it has, you see, been twice mended, once in the wooden stem and once in the amber. each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. the man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.” “anything else?” i asked, for holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way. he held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger, as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone. “pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,” said he. “nothing has more individuality, save perhaps watches and bootlaces. the indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. the owner is obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy.” my friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but i saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if i had followed his reasoning. “you think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe,” said i. “this is grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,” holmes answered, knocking a little out on his palm. “as he might get an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise economy.” “and the other points?” “he has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. you can see that it is quite charred all down one side. of course a match could not have done that. why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe? but you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred. and it is all on the right side of the pipe. from that i gather that he is a left-handed man. you hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. you might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. this has always been held so. then he has bitten through his amber. it takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that. but if i am not mistaken i hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study.” an instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room. he was well but quietly dressed in a dark-grey suit, and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. i should have put him at about thirty, though he was really some years older. “i beg your pardon,” said he, with some embarrassment; “i suppose i should have knocked. yes, of course i should have knocked. the fact is that i am a little upset, and you must put it all down to that.” he passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair. “i can see that you have not slept for a night or two,” said holmes, in his easy, genial way. “that tries a man’s nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. may i ask how i can help you?” “i wanted your advice, sir. i don’t know what to do and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces.” “you wish to employ me as a consulting detective?” “not that only. i want your opinion as a judicious man—as a man of the world. i want to know what i ought to do next. i hope to god you’ll be able to tell me.” he spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was overriding his inclinations. “it’s a very delicate thing,” said he. “one does not like to speak of one’s domestic affairs to strangers. it seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one’s wife with two men whom i have never seen before. it’s horrible to have to do it. but i’ve got to the end of my tether, and i must have advice.” “my dear mr. grant munro—” began holmes. our visitor sprang from his chair. “what!” he cried, “you know my name?” “if you wish to preserve your _incognito_,” said holmes, smiling, “i would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing. i was about to say that my friend and i have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls. i trust that we may do as much for you. might i beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay?” our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead, as if he found it bitterly hard. from every gesture and expression i could see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began. “the facts are these, mr. holmes,” said he. “i am a married man, and have been so for three years. during that time my wife and i have loved each other as fondly and lived as happily as any two that ever were joined. we have not had a difference, not one, in thought or word or deed. and now, since last monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and i find that there is something in her life and in her thought of which i know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. we are estranged, and i want to know why. “now there is one thing that i want to impress upon you before i go any further, mr. holmes. effie loves me. don’t let there be any mistake about that. she loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. i know it. i feel it. i don’t want to argue about that. a man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. but there’s this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.” “kindly let me have the facts, mr. munro,” said holmes, with some impatience. “i’ll tell you what i know about effie’s history. she was a widow when i met her first, though quite young—only twenty-five. her name then was mrs. hebron. she went out to america when she was young, and lived in the town of atlanta, where she married this hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. they had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. i have seen his death certificate. this sickened her of america, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at pinner, in middlesex. i may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven per cent. she had only been six months at pinner when i met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks afterwards. “i am a hop merchant myself, and as i have an income of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at norbury. our little place was very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. we had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. my business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer i had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and i were just as happy as could be wished. i tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began. “there’s one thing i ought to tell you before i go further. when we married, my wife made over all her property to me—rather against my will, for i saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong. however, she would have it so, and it was done. well, about six weeks ago she came to me. “‘jack,’ said she, ‘when you took my money you said that if ever i wanted any i was to ask you for it.’ “‘certainly,’ said i. ‘it’s all your own.’ “‘well,’ said she, ‘i want a hundred pounds.’ “i was a bit staggered at this, for i had imagined it was simply a new dress or something of the kind that she was after. “‘what on earth for?’ i asked. “‘oh,’ said she, in her playful way, ‘you said that you were only my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.’ “‘if you really mean it, of course you shall have the money,’ said i. “‘oh, yes, i really mean it.’ “‘and you won’t tell me what you want it for?’ “‘some day, perhaps, but not just at present, jack.’ “so i had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there had ever been any secret between us. i gave her a check, and i never thought any more of the matter. it may have nothing to do with what came afterwards, but i thought it only right to mention it. “well, i told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house. there is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. just beyond it is a nice little grove of scotch firs, and i used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees are always a neighbourly kind of things. the cottage had been standing empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. i have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would make. “well, last monday evening i was taking a stroll down that way, when i met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. it was clear that the cottage had at last been let. i walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had come to live so near us. and as i looked i suddenly became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows. “i don’t know what there was about that face, mr. holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right down my back. i was some little way off, so that i could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face. that was the impression that i had, and i moved quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me. but as i did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. i stood for five minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my impressions. i could not tell if the face were that of a man or a woman. it had been too far from me for that. but its colour was what had impressed me most. it was of a livid chalky white, and with something set and rigid about it which was shockingly unnatural. so disturbed was i that i determined to see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. i approached and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman with a harsh, forbidding face. “‘what may you be wantin’?’ she asked, in a northern accent. “‘i am your neighbour over yonder,’ said i, nodding towards my house. ‘i see that you have only just moved in, so i thought that if i could be of any help to you in any—’ “‘ay, we’ll just ask ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the door in my face. annoyed at the churlish rebuff, i turned my back and walked home. all evening, though i tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. i determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman, and i had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. i remarked to her, however, before i fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply. “i am usually an extremely sound sleeper. it has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night. and yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not i know not, but i slept much more lightly than usual. half in my dreams i was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. my lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and astonishment held me dumb. she wore an expression such as i had never seen before—such as i should have thought her incapable of assuming. she was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. then, thinking that i was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later i heard a sharp creaking which could only come from the hinges of the front door. i sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that i was truly awake. then i took my watch from under the pillow. it was three in the morning. what on this earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning? “i had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying to find some possible explanation. the more i thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. i was still puzzling over it when i heard the door gently close again, and her footsteps coming up the stairs. “‘where in the world have you been, effie?’ i asked as she entered. “she gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when i spoke, and that cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for there was something indescribably guilty about them. my wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her. “‘you awake, jack!’ she cried, with a nervous laugh. ‘why, i thought that nothing could awake you.’ “‘where have you been?’ i asked, more sternly. “‘i don’t wonder that you are surprised,’ said she, and i could see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings of her mantle. ‘why, i never remember having done such a thing in my life before. the fact is that i felt as though i were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. i really think that i should have fainted if i had not gone out. i stood at the door for a few minutes, and now i am quite myself again.’ “all the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. it was evident to me that she was saying what was false. i said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. what was it that my wife was concealing from me? where had she been during that strange expedition? i felt that i should have no peace until i knew, and yet i shrank from asking her again after once she had told me what was false. all the rest of the night i tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more unlikely than the last. “i should have gone to the city that day, but i was too disturbed in my mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. my wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and i could see from the little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me that she understood that i disbelieved her statement, and that she was at her wits’ end what to do. we hardly exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards i went out for a walk, that i might think the matter out in the fresh morning air. “i went as far as the crystal palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back in norbury by one o’clock. it happened that my way took me past the cottage, and i stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to see if i could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. as i stood there, imagine my surprise, mr. holmes, when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out. “i was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her; but my emotions were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her face when our eyes met. she seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came forward, with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips. “‘ah, jack,’ she said, ‘i have just been in to see if i can be of any assistance to our new neighbours. why do you look at me like that, jack? you are not angry with me?’ “‘so,’ said i, ‘this is where you went during the night.’ “‘what do you mean?’ she cried. “‘you came here. i am sure of it. who are these people, that you should visit them at such an hour?’ “‘i have not been here before.’ “‘how can you tell me what you know is false?’ i cried. ‘your very voice changes as you speak. when have i ever had a secret from you? i shall enter that cottage, and i shall probe the matter to the bottom.’ “‘no, no, jack, for god’s sake!’ she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion. then, as i approached the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back with convulsive strength. “‘i implore you not to do this, jack,’ she cried. ‘i swear that i will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can come of it if you enter that cottage.’ then, as i tried to shake her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty. “‘trust me, jack!’ she cried. ‘trust me only this once. you will never have cause to regret it. you know that i would not have a secret from you if it were not for your own sake. our whole lives are at stake in this. if you come home with me, all will be well. if you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.’ “there was such earnestness, such despair, in her manner that her words arrested me, and i stood irresolute before the door. “‘i will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only,’ said i at last. ‘it is that this mystery comes to an end from now. you are at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are kept from my knowledge. i am willing to forget those which are passed if you will promise that there shall be no more in the future.’ “‘i was sure that you would trust me,’ she cried, with a great sigh of relief. ‘it shall be just as you wish. come away—oh, come away up to the house.’ “still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away from the cottage. as we went i glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face watching us out of the upper window. what link could there be between that creature and my wife? or how could the coarse, rough woman whom i had seen the day before be connected with her? it was a strange puzzle, and yet i knew that my mind could never know ease again until i had solved it. “for two days after this i stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as i know, she never stirred out of the house. on the third day, however, i had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty. “i had gone into town on that day, but i returned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my usual train. as i entered the house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face. “‘where is your mistress?’ i asked. “‘i think that she has gone out for a walk,’ she answered. “my mind was instantly filled with suspicion. i rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. as i did so i happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom i had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. then of course i saw exactly what it all meant. my wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if i should return. tingling with anger, i rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and forever. i saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but i did not stop to speak with them. in the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. i vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. i did not even knock when i reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage. “it was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. in the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom i had seen before. i ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. then i rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. there was no one at all in the whole house. the furniture and pictures were of the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the window of which i had seen the strange face. that was comfortable and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame when i saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago. “i stayed long enough to make certain that the house was absolutely empty. then i left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as i had never had before. my wife came out into the hall as i entered my house; but i was too hurt and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her, i made my way into my study. she followed me, however, before i could close the door. “‘i am sorry that i broke my promise, jack,’ said she; ‘but if you knew all the circumstances i am sure that you would forgive me.’ “‘tell me everything, then,’ said i. “‘i cannot, jack, i cannot,’ she cried. “‘until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph, there can never be any confidence between us,’ said i, and breaking away from her, i left the house. that was yesterday, mr. holmes, and i have not seen her since, nor do i know anything more about this strange business. it is the first shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that i do not know what i should do for the best. suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so i have hurried to you now, and i place myself unreservedly in your hands. if there is any point which i have not made clear, pray question me about it. but, above all, tell me quickly what i am to do, for this misery is more than i can bear.” holmes and i had listened with the utmost interest to this extraordinary statement, which had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a man who is under the influence of extreme emotions. my companion sat silent for some time, with his chin upon his hand, lost in thought. “tell me,” said he at last, “could you swear that this was a man’s face which you saw at the window?” “each time that i saw it i was some distance away from it, so that it is impossible for me to say.” “you appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it.” “it seemed to be of an unnatural colour, and to have a strange rigidity about the features. when i approached, it vanished with a jerk.” “how long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?” “nearly two months.” “have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?” “no; there was a great fire at atlanta very shortly after his death, and all her papers were destroyed.” “and yet she had a certificate of death. you say that you saw it.” “yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.” “did you ever meet any one who knew her in america?” “no.” “did she ever talk of revisiting the place?” “no.” “or get letters from it?” “no.” “thank you. i should like to think over the matter a little now. if the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty. if, on the other hand, as i fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. let me advise you, then, to return to norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. if you have reason to believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. we shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business.” “and if it is still empty?” “in that case i shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with you. good-by; and, above all, do not fret until you know that you really have a cause for it.” “i am afraid that this is a bad business, watson,” said my companion, as he returned after accompanying mr. grant munro to the door. “what do you make of it?” “it had an ugly sound,” i answered. “yes. there’s blackmail in it, or i am much mistaken.” “and who is the blackmailer?” “well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace. upon my word, watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the window, and i would not have missed the case for worlds.” “you have a theory?” “yes, a provisional one. but i shall be surprised if it does not turn out to be correct. this woman’s first husband is in that cottage.” “why do you think so?” “how else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it? the facts, as i read them, are something like this: this woman was married in america. her husband developed some hateful qualities; or shall we say that he contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an imbecile? she flies from him at last, returns to england, changes her name, and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. she has been married three years, and believes that her position is quite secure, having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose name she has assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered by her first husband; or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the invalid. they write to the wife, and threaten to come and expose her. she asks for a hundred pounds, and endeavours to buy them off. they come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that they are her pursuers. she waits until her husband is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavour to persuade them to leave her in peace. having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her, as he has told us, as she comes out. she promises him then not to go there again, but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbours was too strong for her, and she made another attempt, taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. in the midst of this interview the maid rushed in to say that the master had come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurried the inmates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-trees, probably, which was mentioned as standing near. in this way he found the place deserted. i shall be very much surprised, however, if it is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. what do you think of my theory?” “it is all surmise.” “but at least it covers all the facts. when new facts come to our knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it. we can do nothing more until we have a message from our friend at norbury.” but we had not a very long time to wait for that. it came just as we had finished our tea. “the cottage is still tenanted,” it said. “have seen the face again at the window. will meet the seven o’clock train, and will take no steps until you arrive.” he was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation. “they are still there, mr. holmes,” said he, laying his hand hard upon my friend’s sleeve. “i saw lights in the cottage as i came down. we shall settle it now once and for all.” “what is your plan, then?” asked holmes, as he walked down the dark tree-lined road. “i am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house. i wish you both to be there as witnesses.” “you are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife’s warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery?” “yes, i am determined.” “well, i think that you are in the right. any truth is better than indefinite doubt. we had better go up at once. of course, legally, we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but i think that it is worth it.” it was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either side. mr. grant munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could. “there are the lights of my house,” he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees. “and here is the cottage which i am going to enter.” we turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. a yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. as we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the blind. “there is that creature!” cried grant munro. “you can see for yourselves that some one is there. now follow me, and we shall soon know all.” we approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. i could not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty. “for god’s sake, don’t jack!” she cried. “i had a presentiment that you would come this evening. think better of it, dear! trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.” “i have trusted you too long, effie,” he cried, sternly. “leave go of me! i must pass you. my friends and i are going to settle this matter once and forever!” he pushed her to one side, and we followed closely after him. as he threw the door open an old woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. grant munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered at his heels. it was a cosey, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. in the corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. her face was turned away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long white gloves on. as she whisked round to us, i gave a cry of surprise and horror. the face which she turned towards us was of the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any expression. an instant later the mystery was explained. holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child’s ear, a mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. i burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her merriment; but grant munro stood staring, with his hand clutching his throat. “my god!” he cried. “what can be the meaning of this?” “i will tell you the meaning of it,” cried the lady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set face. “you have forced me, against my own judgment, to tell you, and now we must both make the best of it. my husband died at atlanta. my child survived.” “your child?” she drew a large silver locket from her bosom. “you have never seen this open.” “i understood that it did not open.” she touched a spring, and the front hinged back. there was a portrait within of a man strikingly handsome and intelligent-looking, but bearing unmistakable signs upon his features of his african descent. “that is john hebron, of atlanta,” said the lady, “and a nobler man never walked the earth. i cut myself off from my race in order to wed him, but never once while he lived did i for an instant regret it. it was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. it is often so in such matches, and little lucy is darker far than ever her father was. but dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother’s pet.” the little creature ran across at the words and nestled up against the lady’s dress. “when i left her in america,” she continued, “it was only because her health was weak, and the change might have done her harm. she was given to the care of a faithful scotch woman who had once been our servant. never for an instant did i dream of disowning her as my child. but when chance threw you in my way, jack, and i learned to love you, i feared to tell you about my child. god forgive me, i feared that i should lose you, and i had not the courage to tell you. i had to choose between you, and in my weakness i turned away from my own little girl. for three years i have kept her existence a secret from you, but i heard from the nurse, and i knew that all was well with her. at last, however, there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. i struggled against it, but in vain. though i knew the danger, i determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. i sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and i gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbour, without my appearing to be in any way connected with her. i pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about there being a black child in the neighbourhood. if i had been less cautious i might have been more wise, but i was half crazy with fear that you should learn the truth. “it was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. i should have waited for the morning, but i could not sleep for excitement, and so at last i slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awake you. but you saw me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. three days later, however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. and now to-night you at last know all, and i ask you what is to become of us, my child and me?” she clasped her hands and waited for an answer. it was a long ten minutes before grant munro broke the silence, and when his answer came it was one of which i love to think. he lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. “we can talk it over more comfortably at home,” said he. “i am not a very good man, effie, but i think that i am a better one than you have given me credit for being.” holmes and i followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as we came out. “i think,” said he, “that we shall be of more use in london than in norbury.” not another word did he say of the case until late that night, when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his bedroom. “watson,” said he, “if it should ever strike you that i am getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper ‘norbury’ in my ear, and i shall be infinitely obliged to you.” iv. the stockbroker’s clerk shortly after my marriage i had bought a connection in the paddington district. old mr. farquhar, from whom i purchased it, had at one time an excellent general practice; but his age, and an affliction of the nature of st. vitus’s dance from which he suffered, had very much thinned it. the public not unnaturally goes on the principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. thus as my predecessor weakened his practice declined, until when i purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three hundred a year. i had confidence, however, in my own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years the concern would be as flourishing as ever. for three months after taking over the practice i was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend sherlock holmes, for i was too busy to visit baker street, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. i was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in june, as i sat reading the _british medical journal_ after breakfast, i heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion’s voice. “ah, my dear watson,” said he, striding into the room, “i am very delighted to see you! i trust that mrs. watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the sign of four.” “thank you, we are both very well,” said i, shaking him warmly by the hand. “and i hope, also,” he continued, sitting down in the rocking-chair, “that the cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our little deductive problems.” “on the contrary,” i answered, “it was only last night that i was looking over my old notes, and classifying some of our past results.” “i trust that you don’t consider your collection closed.” “not at all. i should wish nothing better than to have some more of such experiences.” “to-day, for example?” “yes, to-day, if you like.” “and as far off as birmingham?” “certainly, if you wish it.” “and the practice?” “i do my neighbour’s when he goes. he is always ready to work off the debt.” “ha! nothing could be better,” said holmes, leaning back in his chair and looking keenly at me from under his half closed lids. “i perceive that you have been unwell lately. summer colds are always a little trying.” “i was confined to the house by a severe chill for three days last week. i thought, however, that i had cast off every trace of it.” “so you have. you look remarkably robust.” “how, then, did you know of it?” “my dear fellow, you know my methods.” “you deduced it, then?” “certainly.” “and from what?” “from your slippers.” i glanced down at the new patent leathers which i was wearing. “how on earth—” i began, but holmes answered my question before it was asked. “your slippers are new,” he said. “you could not have had them more than a few weeks. the soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched. for a moment i thought they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. but near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the shopman’s hieroglyphics upon it. damp would of course have removed this. you had, then, been sitting with your feet outstretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do even in so wet a june as this if he were in his full health.” like all holmes’s reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained. he read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a tinge of bitterness. “i am afraid that i rather give myself away when i explain,” said he. “results without causes are much more impressive. you are ready to come to birmingham, then?” “certainly. what is the case?” “you shall hear it all in the train. my client is outside in a four-wheeler. can you come at once?” “in an instant.” i scribbled a note to my neighbour, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my wife, and joined holmes upon the door-step. “your neighbour is a doctor,” said he, nodding at the brass plate. “yes; he bought a practice as i did.” “an old-established one?” “just the same as mine. both have been ever since the houses were built.” “ah! then you got hold of the best of the two.” “i think i did. but how do you know?” “by the steps, my boy. yours are worn three inches deeper than his. but this gentleman in the cab is my client, mr. hall pycroft. allow me to introduce you to him. whip your horse up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch our train.” the man whom i found myself facing was a well-built, fresh-complexioned young fellow, with a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow moustache. he wore a very shiny top hat and a neat suit of sober black, which made him look what he was—a smart young city man, of the class who have been labeled cockneys, but who give us our crack volunteer regiments, and who turn out more fine athletes and sportsmen than any body of men in these islands. his round, ruddy face was naturally full of cheeriness, but the corners of his mouth seemed to me to be pulled down in a half-comical distress. it was not, however, until we were all in a first-class carriage and well started upon our journey to birmingham that i was able to learn what the trouble was which had driven him to sherlock holmes. “we have a clear run here of seventy minutes,” holmes remarked. “i want you, mr. hall pycroft, to tell my friend your very interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with more detail if possible. it will be of use to me to hear the succession of events again. it is a case, watson, which may prove to have something in it, or may prove to have nothing, but which, at least, presents those unusual and _outré_ features which are as dear to you as they are to me. now, mr. pycroft, i shall not interrupt you again.” our young companion looked at me with a twinkle in his eye. “the worst of the story is,” said he, “that i show myself up as such a confounded fool. of course it may work out all right, and i don’t see that i could have done otherwise; but if i have lost my crib and get nothing in exchange i shall feel what a soft johnnie i have been. i’m not very good at telling a story, dr. watson, but it is like this with me: “i used to have a billet at coxon & woodhouse, of drapers’ gardens, but they were let in early in the spring through the venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came a nasty cropper. i had been with them five years, and old coxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when the smash came, but of course we clerks were all turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. i tried here and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps on the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost for a long time. i had been taking three pounds a week at coxon’s, and i had saved about seventy of them, but i soon worked my way through that and out at the other end. i was fairly at the end of my tether at last, and could hardly find the stamps to answer the advertisements or the envelopes to stick them to. i had worn out my boots paddling up office stairs, and i seemed just as far from getting a billet as ever. “at last i saw a vacancy at mawson & williams’, the great stockbroking firm in lombard street. i daresay e.c. is not much in your line, but i can tell you that this is about the richest house in london. the advertisement was to be answered by letter only. i sent in my testimonial and application, but without the least hope of getting it. back came an answer by return, saying that if i would appear next monday i might take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. no one knows how these things are worked. some people say that the manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first that comes. anyhow it was my innings that time, and i don’t ever wish to feel better pleased. the screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties just about the same as at coxon’s. “and now i come to the queer part of the business. i was in diggings out hampstead way—17, potter’s terrace. well, i was sitting doing a smoke that very evening after i had been promised the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card which had ‘arthur pinner, financial agent,’ printed upon it. i had never heard the name before and could not imagine what he wanted with me; but, of course, i asked her to show him up. in he walked, a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded man, with a touch of the sheeny about his nose. he had a brisk kind of way with him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the value of time.” “‘mr. hall pycroft, i believe?’” said he. “‘yes, sir,’ i answered, pushing a chair towards him. “‘lately engaged at coxon & woodhouse’s?’ “‘yes, sir.’ “‘and now on the staff of mawson’s.’ “‘quite so.’ “‘well,’ said he, ‘the fact is that i have heard some really extraordinary stories about your financial ability. you remember parker, who used to be coxon’s manager? he can never say enough about it.’ “of course i was pleased to hear this. i had always been pretty sharp in the office, but i had never dreamed that i was talked about in the city in this fashion. “‘you have a good memory?’ said he. “‘pretty fair,’ i answered, modestly. “‘have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?’ he asked. “‘yes; i read the stock exchange list every morning.’ “‘now that shows real application!’ he cried. ‘that is the way to prosper! you won’t mind my testing you, will you? let me see. how are ayrshires?’ “‘a hundred and six and a quarter to a hundred and five and seven-eighths.’ “‘and new zealand consolidated?’ “‘a hundred and four. “‘and british broken hills?’ “‘seven to seven-and-six.’ “‘wonderful!’ he cried, with his hands up. ‘this quite fits in with all that i had heard. my boy, my boy, you are very much too good to be a clerk at mawson’s!’ “this outburst rather astonished me, as you can think. ‘well,’ said i, ‘other people don’t think quite so much of me as you seem to do, mr. pinner. i had a hard enough fight to get this berth, and i am very glad to have it.’ “‘pooh, man; you should soar above it. you are not in your true sphere. now, i’ll tell you how it stands with me. what i have to offer is little enough when measured by your ability, but when compared with mawson’s, it’s light to dark. let me see. when do you go to mawson’s?’ “‘on monday.’ “‘ha, ha! i think i would risk a little sporting flutter that you don’t go there at all.’ “‘not go to mawson’s?’ “‘no, sir. by that day you will be the business manager of the franco-midland hardware company, limited, with a hundred and thirty-four branches in the towns and villages of france, not counting one in brussels and one in san remo.’ “this took my breath away. ‘i never heard of it,’ said i. “‘very likely not. it has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it’s too good a thing to let the public into. my brother, harry pinner, is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as managing director. he knew i was in the swim down here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap. a young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. parker spoke of you, and that brought me here to-night. we can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.’ “‘five hundred a year!’ i shouted. “‘only that at the beginning; but you are to have an overriding commission of one per cent on all business done by your agents, and you may take my word for it that this will come to more than your salary.’ “‘but i know nothing about hardware.’ “‘tut, my boy; you know about figures.’ “my head buzzed, and i could hardly sit still in my chair. but suddenly a little chill of doubt came upon me. “‘i must be frank with you,’ said i. ‘mawson only gives me two hundred, but mawson is safe. now, really, i know so little about your company that—’ “‘ah, smart, smart!’ he cried, in a kind of ecstasy of delight. ‘you are the very man for us. you are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. now, here’s a note for a hundred pounds, and if you think that we can do business you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary.’ “‘that is very handsome,’ said i. ‘when should i take over my new duties?’ “‘be in birmingham to-morrow at one,’ said he. ‘i have a note in my pocket here which you will take to my brother. you will find him at 126b, corporation street, where the temporary offices of the company are situated. of course he must confirm your engagement, but between ourselves it will be all right.’ “‘really, i hardly know how to express my gratitude, mr. pinner,’ said i. “‘not at all, my boy. you have only got your deserts. there are one or two small things—mere formalities—which i must arrange with you. you have a bit of paper beside you there. kindly write upon it “i am perfectly willing to act as business manager to the franco-midland hardware company, limited, at a minimum salary of £500.”’ “i did as he asked, and he put the paper in his pocket. “‘there is one other detail,’ said he. ‘what do you intend to do about mawson’s?’ “i had forgotten all about mawson’s in my joy. ‘i’ll write and resign,’ said i. “‘precisely what i don’t want you to do. i had a row over you with mawson’s manager. i had gone up to ask him about you, and he was very offensive; accused me of coaxing you away from the service of the firm, and that sort of thing. at last i fairly lost my temper. “if you want good men you should pay them a good price,” said i.’ “‘he would rather have our small price than your big one,’ said he. “‘i’ll lay you a fiver,’ said i, ‘that when he has my offer you’ll never so much as hear from him again.’ “‘done!’ said he. ‘we picked him out of the gutter, and he won’t leave us so easily.’ those were his very words.” “‘the impudent scoundrel!’ i cried. ‘i’ve never so much as seen him in my life. why should i consider him in any way? i shall certainly not write if you would rather i didn’t.’ “‘good! that’s a promise,’ said he, rising from his chair. ‘well, i’m delighted to have got so good a man for my brother. here’s your advance of a hundred pounds, and here is the letter. make a note of the address, 126b, corporation street, and remember that one o’clock to-morrow is your appointment. good-night; and may you have all the fortune that you deserve!’ “that’s just about all that passed between us, as near as i can remember. you can imagine, dr. watson, how pleased i was at such an extraordinary bit of good fortune. i sat up half the night hugging myself over it, and next day i was off to birmingham in a train that would take me in plenty time for my appointment. i took my things to a hotel in new street, and then i made my way to the address which had been given me. “it was a quarter of an hour before my time, but i thought that would make no difference. 126b, was a passage between two large shops, which led to a winding stone stair, from which there were many flats, let as offices to companies or professional men. the names of the occupants were painted at the bottom on the wall, but there was no such name as the franco-midland hardware company, limited. i stood for a few minutes with my heart in my boots, wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man and addressed me. he was very like the chap i had seen the night before, the same figure and voice, but he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter. “‘are you mr. hall pycroft?’ he asked. “‘yes,’ said i. “‘oh! i was expecting you, but you are a trifle before your time. i had a note from my brother this morning in which he sang your praises very loudly.’ “‘i was just looking for the offices when you came.’ “‘we have not got our name up yet, for we only secured these temporary premises last week. come up with me, and we will talk the matter over.’ “i followed him to the top of a very lofty stair, and there, right under the slates, were a couple of empty, dusty little rooms, uncarpeted and uncurtained, into which he led me. i had thought of a great office with shining tables and rows of clerks, such as i was used to, and i daresay i stared rather straight at the two deal chairs and one little table, which, with a ledger and a waste paper basket, made up the whole furniture. “‘don’t be disheartened, mr. pycroft,’ said my new acquaintance, seeing the length of my face. ‘rome was not built in a day, and we have lots of money at our backs, though we don’t cut much dash yet in offices. pray sit down, and let me have your letter.’ “i gave it to him, and he read it over very carefully. “‘you seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother arthur,’ said he; ‘and i know that he is a pretty shrewd judge. he swears by london, you know; and i by birmingham; but this time i shall follow his advice. pray consider yourself definitely engaged.’ “‘what are my duties?’ i asked. “‘you will eventually manage the great depôt in paris, which will pour a flood of english crockery into the shops of a hundred and thirty-four agents in france. the purchase will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in birmingham and make yourself useful.’ “‘how?’ “for answer, he took a big red book out of a drawer. “‘this is a directory of paris,’ said he, ‘with the trades after the names of the people. i want you to take it home with you, and to mark off all the hardware sellers, with their addresses. it would be of the greatest use to me to have them.’ “‘surely there are classified lists?’ i suggested. “‘not reliable ones. their system is different from ours. stick at it, and let me have the lists by monday, at twelve. good-day, mr. pycroft. if you continue to show zeal and intelligence you will find the company a good master.’ “i went back to the hotel with the big book under my arm, and with very conflicting feelings in my breast. on the one hand, i was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. however, come what might, i had my money, so i settled down to my task. all sunday i was kept hard at work, and yet by monday i had only got as far as h. i went round to my employer, found him in the same dismantled kind of room, and was told to keep at it until wednesday, and then come again. on wednesday it was still unfinished, so i hammered away until friday—that is, yesterday. then i brought it round to mr. harry pinner. “‘thank you very much,’ said he; ‘i fear that i underrated the difficulty of the task. this list will be of very material assistance to me.’ “‘it took some time,’ said i. “‘and now,’ said he, ‘i want you to make a list of the furniture shops, for they all sell crockery.’ “‘very good.’ “‘and you can come up to-morrow evening, at seven, and let me know how you are getting on. don’t overwork yourself. a couple of hours at day’s music hall in the evening would do you no harm after your labours.’ he laughed as he spoke, and i saw with a thrill that his second tooth upon the left-hand side had been very badly stuffed with gold.” sherlock holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and i stared with astonishment at our client. “you may well look surprised, dr. watson; but it is this way,” said he: “when i was speaking to the other chap in london, at the time that he laughed at my not going to mawson’s, i happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion. the glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. when i put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, i could not doubt that it was the same man. of course you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. he bowed me out, and i found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether i was on my head or my heels. back i went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out. why had he sent me from london to birmingham? why had he got there before me? and why had he written a letter from himself to himself? it was altogether too much for me, and i could make no sense of it. and then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to mr. sherlock holmes. i had just time to get up to town by the night train to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me to birmingham.” there was a pause after the stockbroker’s clerk had concluded his surprising experience. then sherlock holmes cocked his eye at me, leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a comet vintage. “rather fine, watson, is it not?” said he. “there are points in it which please me. i think that you will agree with me that an interview with mr. arthur harry pinner in the temporary offices of the franco-midland hardware company, limited, would be a rather interesting experience for both of us.” “but how can we do it?” i asked. “oh, easily enough,” said hall pycroft, cheerily. “you are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be more natural than that i should bring you both round to the managing director?” “quite so, of course,” said holmes. “i should like to have a look at the gentleman, and see if i can make anything of his little game. what qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable? or is it possible that—” he began biting his nails and staring blankly out of the window, and we hardly drew another word from him until we were in new street. at seven o’clock that evening we were walking, the three of us, down corporation street to the company’s offices. “it is no use our being at all before our time,” said our client. “he only comes there to see me, apparently, for the place is deserted up to the very hour he names.” “that is suggestive,” remarked holmes. “by jove, i told you so!” cried the clerk. “that’s he walking ahead of us there.” he pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed man who was bustling along the other side of the road. as we watched him he looked across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he bought one from him. then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished through a doorway. “there he goes!” cried hall pycroft. “these are the company’s offices into which he has gone. come with me, and i’ll fix it up as easily as possible.” following his lead, we ascended five stories, until we found ourselves outside a half-opened door, at which our client tapped. a voice within bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished room such as hall pycroft had described. at the single table sat the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed to me that i had never looked upon a face which bore such marks of grief, and of something beyond grief—of a horror such as comes to few men in a lifetime. his brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish’s belly, and his eyes were wild and staring. he looked at his clerk as though he failed to recognise him, and i could see by the astonishment depicted upon our conductor’s face that this was by no means the usual appearance of his employer. “you look ill, mr. pinner!” he exclaimed. “yes, i am not very well,” answered the other, making obvious efforts to pull himself together, and licking his dry lips before he spoke. “who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?” “one is mr. harris, of bermondsey, and the other is mr. price, of this town,” said our clerk, glibly. “they are friends of mine and gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the company’s employment.” “very possibly! very possibly!” cried mr. pinner with a ghastly smile. “yes, i have no doubt that we shall be able to do something for you. what is your particular line, mr. harris?” “i am an accountant,” said holmes. “ah yes, we shall want something of the sort. and you, mr. price?” “a clerk,” said i. “i have every hope that the company may accommodate you. i will let you know about it as soon as we come to any conclusion. and now i beg that you will go. for god’s sake leave me to myself!” these last words were shot out of him, as though the constraint which he was evidently setting upon himself had suddenly and utterly burst asunder. holmes and i glanced at each other, and hall pycroft took a step towards the table. “you forget, mr. pinner, that i am here by appointment to receive some directions from you,” said he. “certainly, mr. pycroft, certainly,” the other resumed in a calmer tone. “you may wait here a moment; and there is no reason why your friends should not wait with you. i will be entirely at your service in three minutes, if i might trespass upon your patience so far.” he rose with a very courteous air, and, bowing to us, he passed out through a door at the farther end of the room, which he closed behind him. “what now?” whispered holmes. “is he giving us the slip?” “impossible,” answered pycroft. “why so?” “that door leads into an inner room.” “there is no exit?” “none.” “is it furnished?” “it was empty yesterday.” “then what on earth can he be doing? there is something which i don’t understand in this manner. if ever a man was three parts mad with terror, that man’s name is pinner. what can have put the shivers on him?” “he suspects that we are detectives,” i suggested. “that’s it,” cried pycroft. holmes shook his head. “he did not turn pale. he was pale when we entered the room,” said he. “it is just possible that—” his words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat from the direction of the inner door. “what the deuce is he knocking at his own door for?” cried the clerk. again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat. we all gazed expectantly at the closed door. glancing at holmes, i saw his face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement. then suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a brisk drumming upon woodwork. holmes sprang frantically across the room and pushed at the door. it was fastened on the inner side. following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. one hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door with a crash. rushing over it, we found ourselves in the inner room. it was empty. but it was only for a moment that we were at fault. at one corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was a second door. holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. a coat and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the managing director of the franco-midland hardware company. his knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the noise which had broken in upon our conversation. in an instant i had caught him round the waist, and held him up while holmes and pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between the livid creases of skin. then we carried him into the other room, where he lay with a clay-coloured face, puffing his purple lips in and out with every breath—a dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes before. “what do you think of him, watson?” asked holmes. i stooped over him and examined him. his pulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breathing grew longer, and there was a little shivering of his eyelids, which showed a thin white slit of ball beneath. “it has been touch and go with him,” said i, “but he’ll live now. just open that window, and hand me the water carafe.” i undid his collar, poured the cold water over his face, and raised and sank his arms until he drew a long, natural breath. “it’s only a question of time now,” said i, as i turned away from him. holmes stood by the table, with his hands deep in his trouser’s pockets and his chin upon his breast. “i suppose we ought to call the police in now,” said he. “and yet i confess that i’d like to give them a complete case when they come.” “it’s a blessed mystery to me,” cried pycroft, scratching his head. “whatever they wanted to bring me all the way up here for, and then—” “pooh! all that is clear enough,” said holmes impatiently. “it is this last sudden move.” “you understand the rest, then?” “i think that it is fairly obvious. what do you say, watson?” i shrugged my shoulders. “i must confess that i am out of my depths,” said i. “oh, surely if you consider the events at first they can only point to one conclusion.” “what do you make of them?” “well, the whole thing hinges upon two points. the first is the making of pycroft write a declaration by which he entered the service of this preposterous company. do you not see how very suggestive that is?” “i am afraid i miss the point.” “well, why did they want him to do it? not as a business matter, for these arrangements are usually verbal, and there was no earthly business reason why this should be an exception. don’t you see, my young friend, that they were very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting, and had no other way of doing it?” “and why?” “quite so. why? when we answer that we have made some progress with our little problem. why? there can be only one adequate reason. some one wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen of it first. and now if we pass on to the second point we find that each throws light upon the other. that point is the request made by pinner that you should not resign your place, but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a mr. hall pycroft, whom he had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the monday morning.” “my god!” cried our client, “what a blind beetle i have been!” “now you see the point about the handwriting. suppose that some one turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand from that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of course the game would have been up. but in the interval the rogue had learned to imitate you, and his position was therefore secure, as i presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you.” “not a soul,” groaned hall pycroft. “very good. of course it was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was at work in mawson’s office. therefore they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and ran you off to the midlands, where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to london, where you might have burst their little game up. that is all plain enough.” “but why should this man pretend to be his own brother?” “well, that is pretty clear also. there are evidently only two of them in it. the other is impersonating you at the office. this one acted as your engager, and then found that he could not find you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot. that he was most unwilling to do. he changed his appearance as far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance. but for the happy chance of the gold stuffing, your suspicions would probably never have been aroused.” hall pycroft shook his clinched hands in the air. “good lord!” he cried, “while i have been fooled in this way, what has this other hall pycroft been doing at mawson’s? what should we do, mr. holmes? tell me what to do.” “we must wire to mawson’s.” “they shut at twelve on saturdays.” “never mind. there may be some door-keeper or attendant—” “ah yes, they keep a permanent guard there on account of the value of the securities that they hold. i remember hearing it talked of in the city.” “very good; we shall wire to him, and see if all is well, and if a clerk of your name is working there. that is clear enough; but what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues should instantly walk out of the room and hang himself.” “the paper!” croaked a voice behind us. the man was sitting up, blanched and ghastly, with returning reason in his eyes, and hands which rubbed nervously at the broad red band which still encircled his throat. “the paper! of course!” yelled holmes, in a paroxysm of excitement. “idiot that i was! i thought so much of our visit that the paper never entered my head for an instant. to be sure, the secret must be there.” he flattened it out upon the table, and a cry of triumph burst from his lips. “look at this, watson,” he cried. “it is a london paper, an early edition of the _evening standard_. here is what we want. look at the headlines: ‘crime in the city. murder at mawson & williams’. gigantic attempted robbery. capture of the criminal.’ here, watson, we are all equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.” it appeared from its position in the paper to have been the one event of importance in town, and the account of it ran in this way: “a desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in the city. for some time back mawson & williams, the famous financial house, have been the guardians of securities which amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million sterling. so conscious was the manager of the responsibility which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at stake that safes of the very latest construction have been employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in the building. it appears that last week a new clerk named hall pycroft was engaged by the firm. this person appears to have been none other than beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who, with his brother, had only recently emerged from a five years’ spell of penal servitude. by some means, which are not yet clear, he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official position in the office, which he utilised in order to obtain moulding of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the position of the strong room and the safes. “it is customary at mawson’s for the clerks to leave at midday on saturday. sergeant tuson, of the city police, was somewhat surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. his suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of constable pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him. it was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed. nearly a hundred thousand pounds’ worth of american railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in other mines and companies, was discovered in the bag. on examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where it would not have been discovered until monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of sergeant tuson. the man’s skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind. there could be no doubt that beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him, and having murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then made off with his booty. his brother, who usually works with him, has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be ascertained, although the police are making energetic inquiries as to his whereabouts.” “well, we may save the police some little trouble in that direction,” said holmes, glancing at the haggard figure huddled up by the window. “human nature is a strange mixture, watson. you see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited. however, we have no choice as to our action. the doctor and i will remain on guard, mr. pycroft, if you will have the kindness to step out for the police.” v. the “_gloria scott_” “i have some papers here,” said my friend sherlock holmes, as we sat one winter’s night on either side of the fire, “which i really think, watson, that it would be worth your while to glance over. these are the documents in the extraordinary case of the _gloria scott_, and this is the message which struck justice of the peace trevor dead with horror when he read it.” he had picked from a drawer a little tarnished cylinder, and, undoing the tape, he handed me a short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate-grey paper. “the supply of game for london is going steadily up,” it ran. “head-keeper hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant’s life.” as i glanced up from reading this enigmatical message, i saw holmes chuckling at the expression upon my face. “you look a little bewildered,” said he. “i cannot see how such a message as this could inspire horror. it seems to me to be rather grotesque than otherwise.” “very likely. yet the fact remains that the reader, who was a fine, robust old man, was knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt end of a pistol.” “you arouse my curiosity,” said i. “but why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why i should study this case?” “because it was the first in which i was ever engaged.” i had often endeavoured to elicit from my companion what had first turned his mind in the direction of criminal research, but had never caught him before in a communicative humour. now he sat forward in this armchair and spread out the documents upon his knees. then he lit his pipe and sat for some time smoking and turning them over. “you never heard me talk of victor trevor?” he asked. “he was the only friend i made during the two years i was at college. i was never a very sociable fellow, watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and working out my own little methods of thought, so that i never mixed much with the men of my year. bar fencing and boxing i had few athletic tastes, and then my line of study was quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. trevor was the only man i knew, and that only through the accident of his bull terrier freezing on to my ankle one morning as i went down to chapel. “it was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was effective. i was laid by the heels for ten days, but trevor used to come in to inquire after me. at first it was only a minute’s chat, but soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of the term we were close friends. he was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirits and energy, the very opposite to me in most respects, but we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond of union when i found that he was as friendless as i. finally, he invited me down to his father’s place at donnithorpe, in norfolk, and i accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation. “old trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration, a j.p. and a landed proprietor. donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the north of langmere, in the country of the broads. the house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread, oak-beamed brick building, with a fine lime-lined avenue leading up to it. there was excellent wild-duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as i understood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that he would be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there. “trevor senior was a widower, and my friend his only son. “there had been a daughter, i heard, but she had died of diphtheria while on a visit to birmingham. the father interested me extremely. he was a man of little culture, but with a considerable amount of rude strength, both physically and mentally. he knew hardly any books, but he had travelled far, had seen much of the world. and had remembered all that he had learned. in person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes which were keen to the verge of fierceness. yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity on the country-side, and was noted for the leniency of his sentences from the bench. “one evening, shortly after my arrival, we were sitting over a glass of port after dinner, when young trevor began to talk about those habits of observation and inference which i had already formed into a system, although i had not yet appreciated the part which they were to play in my life. the old man evidently thought that his son was exaggerating in his description of one or two trivial feats which i had performed. “‘come, now, mr. holmes,’ said he, laughing good-humoredly. ‘i’m an excellent subject, if you can deduce anything from me.’ “‘i fear there is not very much,’ i answered; ‘i might suggest that you have gone about in fear of some personal attack within the last twelve months.’ “the laugh faded from his lips, and he stared at me in great surprise. “‘well, that’s true enough,’ said he. ‘you know, victor,’ turning to his son, ‘when we broke up that poaching gang, they swore to knife us, and sir edward holly has actually been attacked. i’ve always been on my guard since then, though i have no idea how you know it.’ “‘you have a very handsome stick,’ i answered. ‘by the inscription i observed that you had not had it more than a year. but you have taken some pains to bore the head of it and pour melted lead into the hole so as to make it a formidable weapon. i argued that you would not take such precautions unless you had some danger to fear.’ “‘anything else?’ he asked, smiling. “‘you have boxed a good deal in your youth.’ “‘right again. how did you know it? is my nose knocked a little out of the straight?’ “‘no,’ said i. ‘it is your ears. they have the peculiar flattening and thickening which marks the boxing man.’ “‘anything else?’ “‘you have done a good deal of digging by your callosities.’ “‘made all my money at the gold fields.’ “‘you have been in new zealand.’ “‘right again.’ “‘you have visited japan.’ “‘quite true.’ “‘and you have been most intimately associated with some one whose initials were j. a., and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely forget.’ “mr. trevor stood slowly up, fixed his large blue eyes upon me with a strange wild stare, and then pitched forward, with his face among the nutshells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint. “you can imagine, watson, how shocked both his son and i were. his attack did not last long, however, for when we undid his collar, and sprinkled the water from one of the finger-glasses over his face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up. “‘ah, boys,’ said he, forcing a smile, ‘i hope i haven’t frightened you. strong as i look, there is a weak place in my heart, and it does not take much to knock me over. i don’t know how you manage this, mr. holmes, but it seems to me that all the detectives of fact and of fancy would be children in your hands. that’s your line of life, sir, and you may take the word of a man who has seen something of the world.’ “and that recommendation, with the exaggerated estimate of my ability with which he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, watson, the very first thing which ever made me feel that a profession might be made out of what had up to that time been the merest hobby. at the moment, however, i was too much concerned at the sudden illness of my host to think of anything else. “‘i hope that i have said nothing to pain you?’ said i. “‘well, you certainly touched upon rather a tender point. might i ask how you know, and how much you know?’ he spoke now in a half-jesting fashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back of his eyes. “‘it is simplicity itself,’ said i. ‘when you bared your arm to draw that fish into the boat i saw that j. a. had been tattooed in the bend of the elbow. the letters were still legible, but it was perfectly clear from their blurred appearance, and from the staining of the skin round them, that efforts had been made to obliterate them. it was obvious, then, that those initials had once been very familiar to you, and that you had afterwards wished to forget them.’ “what an eye you have!” he cried, with a sigh of relief. ‘it is just as you say. but we won’t talk of it. of all ghosts the ghosts of our old lovers are the worst. come into the billiard-room and have a quiet cigar.’ “from that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch of suspicion in mr. trevor’s manner towards me. even his son remarked it. ‘you’ve given the governor such a turn,’ said he, ‘that he’ll never be sure again of what you know and what you don’t know.’ he did not mean to show it, i am sure, but it was so strongly in his mind that it peeped out at every action. at last i became so convinced that i was causing him uneasiness that i drew my visit to a close. on the very day, however, before i left, an incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of importance. “we were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs, the three of us, basking in the sun and admiring the view across the broads, when a maid came out to say that there was a man at the door who wanted to see mr. trevor. “‘what is his name?’ asked my host. “‘he would not give any.’ “‘what does he want, then?’ “‘he says that you know him, and that he only wants a moment’s conversation.’ “‘show him round here.’ an instant afterwards there appeared a little wizened fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling style of walking. he wore an open jacket, with a splotch of tar on the sleeve, a red-and-black check shirt, dungaree trousers, and heavy boots badly worn. his face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it, which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. as he came slouching across the lawn i heard mr. trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. he was back in a moment, and i smelt a strong reek of brandy as he passed me. “‘well, my man,’ said he, ‘what can i do for you?’ “the sailor stood looking at him with puckered eyes, and with the same loose-lipped smile upon his face. “‘you don’t know me?’ he asked. “‘why, dear me, it is surely hudson,’ said mr. trevor in a tone of surprise. “‘hudson it is, sir,’ said the seaman. ‘why, it’s thirty year and more since i saw you last. here you are in your house, and me still picking my salt meat out of the harness cask.’ “‘tut, you will find that i have not forgotten old times,’ cried mr. trevor, and, walking towards the sailor, he said something in a low voice. ‘go into the kitchen,’ he continued out loud, ‘and you will get food and drink. i have no doubt that i shall find you a situation.’ “‘thank you, sir,’ said the seaman, touching his forelock. ‘i’m just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed at that, and i wants a rest. i thought i’d get it either with mr. beddoes or with you.’ “‘ah!’ cried trevor. ‘you know where mr. beddoes is?’ “‘bless you, sir, i know where all my old friends are,’ said the fellow with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen. mr. trevor mumbled something to us about having been shipmate with the man when he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn, he went indoors. an hour later, when we entered the house, we found him stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa. the whole incident left a most ugly impression upon my mind, and i was not sorry next day to leave donnithorpe behind me, for i felt that my presence must be a source of embarrassment to my friend. “all this occurred during the first month of the long vacation. i went up to my london rooms, where i spent seven weeks working out a few experiments in organic chemistry. one day, however, when the autumn was far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close, i received a telegram from my friend imploring me to return to donnithorpe, and saying that he was in great need of my advice and assistance. of course i dropped everything and set out for the north once more. “he met me with the dog-cart at the station, and i saw at a glance that the last two months had been very trying ones for him. he had grown thin and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery manner for which he had been remarkable. “‘the governor is dying,’ were the first words he said. “‘impossible!’ i cried. ‘what is the matter?’ “‘apoplexy. nervous shock, he’s been on the verge all day. i doubt if we shall find him alive.’ “i was, as you may think, watson, horrified at this unexpected news. “‘what has caused it?’ i asked. “‘ah, that is the point. jump in and we can talk it over while we drive. you remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?’ “‘perfectly.’ “‘do you know who it was that we let into the house that day?’ “‘i have no idea.’ “‘it was the devil, holmes,’ he cried. “i stared at him in astonishment. “‘yes, it was the devil himself. we have not had a peaceful hour since—not one. the governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now the life has been crushed out of him and his heart broken, all through this accursed hudson.’ “‘what power had he, then?’ “‘ah, that is what i would give so much to know. the kindly, charitable, good old governor—how could he have fallen into the clutches of such a ruffian! but i am so glad that you have come, holmes. i trust very much to your judgment and discretion, and i know that you will advise me for the best.’ “we were dashing along the smooth white country road, with the long stretch of the broads in front of us glimmering in the red light of the setting sun. from a grove upon our left i could already see the high chimneys and the flag-staff which marked the squire’s dwelling. “‘my father made the fellow gardener,’ said my companion, ‘and then, as that did not satisfy him, he was promoted to be butler. the house seemed to be at his mercy, and he wandered about and did what he chose in it. the maids complained of his drunken habits and his vile language. the dad raised their wages all round to recompense them for the annoyance. the fellow would take the boat and my father’s best gun and treat himself to little shooting trips. and all this with such a sneering, leering, insolent face that i would have knocked him down twenty times over if he had been a man of my own age. i tell you, holmes, i have had to keep a tight hold upon myself all this time; and now i am asking myself whether, if i had let myself go a little more, i might not have been a wiser man. “‘well, matters went from bad to worse with us, and this animal hudson became more and more intrusive, until at last, on making some insolent reply to my father in my presence one day, i took him by the shoulders and turned him out of the room. he slunk away with a livid face and two venomous eyes which uttered more threats than his tongue could do. i don’t know what passed between the poor dad and him after that, but the dad came to me next day and asked me whether i would mind apologising to hudson. i refused, as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household. “‘“ah, my boy,” said he, “it is all very well to talk, but you don’t know how i am placed. but you shall know, victor. i’ll see that you shall know, come what may. you wouldn’t believe harm of your poor old father, would you, lad?” he was very much moved, and shut himself up in the study all day, where i could see through the window that he was writing busily. “‘that evening there came what seemed to me to be a grand release, for hudson told us that he was going to leave us. he walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and announced his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man. “‘“i’ve had enough of norfolk,” said he. “i’ll run down to mr. beddoes in hampshire. he’ll be as glad to see me as you were, i daresay.” “‘“you’re not going away in an unkind spirit, hudson, i hope,” said my father, with a tameness which made my blood boil. “‘“i’ve not had my ’pology,” said he sulkily, glancing in my direction. “‘“victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow rather roughly,” said the dad, turning to me. “‘“on the contrary, i think that we have both shown extraordinary patience towards him,” i answered. “‘“oh, you do, do you?” he snarls. “very good, mate. we’ll see about that!” he slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. night after night i heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall. “‘and how?’ i asked eagerly. “‘in a most extraordinary fashion. a letter arrived for my father yesterday evening, bearing the fordingbridge postmark. my father read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his senses. when i at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eyelids were all puckered on one side, and i saw that he had a stroke. dr. fordham came over at once. we put him to bed; but the paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning consciousness, and i think that we shall hardly find him alive.’ “‘you horrify me, trevor!’ i cried. ‘what then could have been in this letter to cause so dreadful a result?’ “‘nothing. there lies the inexplicable part of it. the message was absurd and trivial. ah, my god, it is as i feared!’ “as he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. as we dashed up to the door, my friend’s face convulsed with grief, a gentleman in black emerged from it. “‘when did it happen, doctor?’ asked trevor. “‘almost immediately after you left.’ “‘did he recover consciousness?’ “‘for an instant before the end.’ “‘any message for me?’ “‘only that the papers were in the back drawer of the japanese cabinet.’ “my friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while i remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my head, and feeling as sombre as ever i had done in my life. what was the past of this trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman? why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from fordingbridge? then i remembered that fordingbridge was in hampshire, and that this mr. beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in hampshire. the letter, then, might either come from hudson, the seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it might come from beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was imminent. so far it seemed clear enough. but then how could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? he must have misread it. if so, it must have been one of those ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean another. i must see this letter. if there were a hidden meaning in it, i was confident that i could pluck it forth. for an hour i sat pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend trevor, pale but composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his grasp. he sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a single sheet of grey paper. ‘the supply of game for london is going steadily up,’ it ran. ‘head-keeper hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly paper and for preservation of your hen pheasant’s life.’ “i daresay my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when first i read this message. then i reread it very carefully. it was evidently as i had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried in this strange combination of words. or could it be that there was a prearranged significance to such phrases as ‘fly paper’ and ‘hen pheasant’? such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be deduced in any way. and yet i was loath to believe that this was the case, and the presence of the word ‘hudson’ seemed to show that the subject of the message was as i had guessed, and that it was from beddoes rather than the sailor. i tried it backwards, but the combination ‘life pheasant’s hen’ was not encouraging. then i tried alternate words, but neither ‘the of for’ nor ‘supply game london’ promised to throw any light upon it. and then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and i saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a message which might well drive old trevor to despair. “it was short and terse, the warning, as i now read it to my companion: “‘the game is up. hudson has told all. fly for your life.’ “victor trevor sank his face into his shaking hands. ‘it must be that, i suppose,’ said he. ‘this is worse than death, for it means disgrace as well. but what is the meaning of these “head-keepers” and “hen pheasants”?’ “‘it means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. you see that he has begun by writing “the ... game ... is,” and so on. afterwards he had, to fulfill the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words in each space. he would naturally use the first words which came to his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested in breeding. do you know anything of this beddoes?’ “‘why, now that you mention it,’ said he, ‘i remember that my poor father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his preserves every autumn.’ “‘then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,’ said i. ‘it only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and respected men.’ “‘alas, holmes, i fear that it is one of sin and shame!’ cried my friend. ‘but from you i shall have no secrets. here is the statement which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from hudson had become imminent. i found it in the japanese cabinet, as he told the doctor. take it and read it to me, for i have neither the strength nor the courage to do it myself.’ “these are the very papers, watson, which he handed to me, and i will read them to you, as i read them in the old study that night to him. they are endorsed outside, as you see, ‘some particulars of the voyage of the bark _gloria scott_, from her leaving falmouth on the 8th october, 1855, to her destruction in n. lat. 15º 20’, w. long. 25º 14’ on nov. 6th.’ it is in the form of a letter, and runs in this way: “‘my dear, dear son,—now that approaching disgrace begins to darken the closing years of my life, i can write with all truth and honesty that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you should come to blush for me—you who love me and who have seldom, i hope, had reason to do other than respect me. but if the blow falls which is forever hanging over me, then i should wish you to read this, that you may know straight from me how far i have been to blame. on the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind god almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still undestroyed and should fall into your hands, i conjure you, by all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give one thought to it again. “‘if then your eye goes on to read this line, i know that i shall already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue sealed forever in death. in either case the time for suppression is past, and every word which i tell you is the naked truth, and this i swear as i hope for mercy. “‘my name, dear lad, is not trevor. i was james armitage in my younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which seemed to imply that he had surmised my secret. as armitage it was that i entered a london banking house, and as armitage i was convicted of breaking my country’s laws, and was sentenced to transportation. do not think very harshly of me, laddie. it was a debt of honour, so called, which i had to pay, and i used money which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that i could replace it before there could be any possibility of its being missed. but the most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. the money which i had reckoned upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts exposed my deficit. the case might have been dealt leniently with, but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than now, and on my twenty-third birthday i found myself chained as a felon with thirty-seven other convicts in ’tween-decks of the barque _gloria scott_, bound for australia. “‘it was the year ’55 when the crimean war was at its height, and the old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the black sea. the government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. the _gloria scott_ had been in the chinese tea trade, but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her out. she was a five-hundred-ton boat, and besides her thirty-eight gaol-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from falmouth. “‘the partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and frail. the man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom i had particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. he was a young man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker jaws. he carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. i don’t think any of our heads would have come up to his shoulder, and i am sure that he could not have measured less than six and a half feet. it was strange among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and resolution. the sight of it was to me like a fire in a snowstorm. i was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbour, and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, i heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated us. “‘“hallao, chummy!” said he, “what’s your name, and what are you here for?” “‘i answered him, and asked in turn who i was talking with. “‘“i’m jack prendergast,” said he, “and by god! you’ll learn to bless my name before you’ve done with me.” “‘i remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own arrest. he was a man of good family and of great ability, but of incurably vicious habits, who had by an ingenious system of fraud obtained huge sums of money from the leading london merchants. “‘“ha, ha! you remember my case!” said he proudly. “‘“very well, indeed.” “‘“then maybe you remember something queer about it?” “‘“what was that, then?” “‘“i’d had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn’t i?” “‘“so it was said.” “‘“but none was recovered, eh?” “‘“no.” “‘“well, where d’ye suppose the balance is?” he asked. “‘“i have no idea,” said i. “‘“right between my finger and thumb,” he cried. “by god! i’ve got more pounds to my name than you’ve hairs on your head. and if you’ve money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do _anything!_ now, you don’t think it likely that a man who could do anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a china coaster. no, sir, such a man will look after himself and will look after his chums. you may lay to that! you hold on to him, and you may kiss the book that he’ll haul you through.” “‘that was his style of talk, and at first i thought it meant nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really was a plot to gain command of the vessel. a dozen of the prisoners had hatched it before they came aboard, prendergast was the leader, and his money was the motive power. “‘“i’d a partner,” said he, “a rare good man, as true as a stock to a barrel. he’s got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at this moment? why, he’s the chaplain of this ship—the chaplain, no less! he came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to main-truck. the crew are his, body and soul. he could buy ’em at so much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they signed on. he’s got two of the warders and mercer, the second mate, and he’d get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it.” “‘“what are we to do, then?” i asked. “‘“what do you think?” said he. “we’ll make the coats of some of these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did.” “‘“but they are armed,” said i. “‘“and so shall we be, my boy. there’s a brace of pistols for every mother’s son of us, and if we can’t carry this ship, with the crew at our back, it’s time we were all sent to a young misses’ boarding-school. you speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and see if he is to be trusted.” “‘i did so, and found my other neighbour to be a young fellow in much the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. his name was evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a rich and prosperous man in the south of england. he was ready enough to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and before we had crossed the bay there were only two of the prisoners who were not in the secret. one of these was of weak mind, and we did not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and could not be of any use to us. ““from the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from taking possession of the ship. the crew were a set of ruffians, specially picked for the job. the sham chaplain came into our cells to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts, and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of powder, and twenty slugs. two of the warders were agents of prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. the captain, the two mates, two warders, lieutenant martin, his eighteen soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against us. yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack suddenly by night. it came, however, more quickly than we expected, and in this way. “‘one evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the pistols. if he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized him. he was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. he had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. the two sentries were shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to see what was the matter. there were two more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot while trying to fix their bayonets. then we rushed on into the captain’s cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over the chart of the atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. the two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business seemed to be settled. “‘the state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more. there were lockers all round, and wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. we cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we could not see across the table. when it cleared again the place was a shambles. wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when i think of it. we were so cowed by the sight that i think we should have given the job up if it had not been for prendergast. he bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all that were left alive at his heels. out we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. the swing skylights above the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through the slit. we got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all over. my god! was there ever a slaughter-house like that ship! prendergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or dead. there was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out his brains. when the fighting was over there was no one left of our enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor. “‘it was over them that the great quarrel arose. there were many of us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have murder on our souls. it was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done. but there was no moving prendergast and those who were with him. our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. it nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. we jumped at the offer, for we were already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was done. we were given a suit of sailors’ togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered in lat. 15º n. and long 25º w., and then cut the painter and let us go. “‘and now i come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear son. the seamen had hauled the foreyard aback during the rising, but now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a light wind from the north and east the barque began to draw slowly away from us. our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and evans and i, who were the most educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what coast we should make for. it was a nice question, for the cape de verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the african coast about seven hundred to the east. on the whole, as the wind was coming round to the north, we thought that sierra leone might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the barque being at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. a few seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the _gloria scott_. in an instant we swept the boat’s head round again and pulled with all our strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water marked the scene of this catastrophe. “‘it was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared that we had come too late to save any one. a splintered boat and a number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying stretched across it. when we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to be a young seaman of the name of hudson, who was so burned and exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until the following morning. “‘it seemed that after we had left, prendergast and his gang had proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. the two warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third mate. prendergast then descended into the ’tween-decks and with his own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. there only remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. when he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. “‘a dozen convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder barrel, which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. an instant later the explosion occurred, though hudson thought it was caused by the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate’s match. be the cause what it may, it was the end of the _gloria scott_ and of the rabble who held command of her. “‘such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible business in which i was involved. next day we were picked up by the brig _hotspur_, bound for australia, whose captain found no difficulty in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. the transport ship _gloria scott_ was set down by the admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate. after an excellent voyage the _hotspur_ landed us at sydney, where evans and i changed our names and made our way to the diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. “‘the rest i need not relate. we prospered, we travelled, we came back as rich colonials to england, and we bought country estates. for more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was forever buried. imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who came to us i recognised instantly the man who had been picked off the wreck. he had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live upon our fears. you will understand now how it was that i strove to keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathise with me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his other victim with threats upon his tongue.’ “underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible, ‘beddoes writes in cipher to say h. has told all. sweet lord, have mercy on our souls!’ “that was the narrative which i read that night to young trevor, and i think, watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one. the good fellow was heartbroken at it, and went out to the terai tea planting, where i hear that he is doing well. as to the sailor and beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on which the letter of warning was written. they both disappeared utterly and completely. no complaint had been lodged with the police, so that beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. hudson had been seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had done away with beddoes and had fled. for myself i believe that the truth was exactly the opposite. i think that it is most probable that beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been already betrayed, had revenged himself upon hudson, and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. those are the facts of the case, doctor, and if they are of any use to your collection, i am sure that they are very heartily at your service.” vi. the musgrave ritual an anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend sherlock holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. not that i am in the least conventional in that respect myself. the rough-and-tumble work in afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. but with me there is a limit, and when i find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then i begin to give myself virtuous airs. i have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when holmes, in one of his queer humours, would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic v. r. done in bullet-pocks, i felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it. our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places. but his papers were my great crux. he had a horror of destroying documents, especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as i have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were followed by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his books, hardly moving save from the sofa to the table. thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner. one winter’s night, as we sat together by the fire, i ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable. he could not deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box behind him. this he placed in the middle of the floor and, squatting down upon a stool in front of it, he threw back the lid. i could see that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages. “there are cases enough here, watson,” said he, looking at me with mischievous eyes. “i think that if you knew all that i had in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in.” “these are the records of your early work, then?” i asked. “i have often wished that i had notes of those cases.” “yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my biographer had come to glorify me.” he lifted bundle after bundle in a tender, caressing sort of way. “they are not all successes, watson,” said he. “but there are some pretty little problems among them. here’s the record of the tarleton murders, and the case of vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old russian woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch, as well as a full account of ricoletti of the club-foot, and his abominable wife. and here—ah, now, this really is something a little _recherché_.” he dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children’s toys are kept in. from within he produced a crumpled piece of paper, an old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it, and three rusty old disks of metal. “well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?” he asked, smiling at my expression. “it is a curious collection.” “very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still.” “these relics have a history then?” “so much so that they _are_ history.” “what do you mean by that?” sherlock holmes picked them up one by one, and laid them along the edge of the table. then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. “these,” said he, “are all that i have left to remind me of the adventure of the musgrave ritual.” i had heard him mention the case more than once, though i had never been able to gather the details. “i should be so glad,” said i, “if you would give me an account of it.” “and leave the litter as it is?” he cried, mischievously. “your tidiness won’t bear much strain after all, watson. but i should be glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there are points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of this or, i believe, of any other country. a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business. “you may remember how the affair of the _gloria scott_, and my conversation with the unhappy man whose fate i told you of, first turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has become my life’s work. you see me now when my name has become known far and wide, and when i am generally recognised both by the public and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in doubtful cases. even when you knew me first, at the time of the affair which you have commemorated in ‘a study in scarlet,’ i had already established a considerable, though not a very lucrative, connection. you can hardly realize, then, how difficult i found it at first, and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway. “when i first came up to london i had rooms in montague street, just round the corner from the british museum, and there i waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of science which might make me more efficient. now and again cases came in my way, principally through the introduction of old fellow-students, for during my last years at the university there was a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods. the third of these cases was that of the musgrave ritual, and it is to the interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events, and the large issues which proved to be at stake, that i trace my first stride towards the position which i now hold. “reginald musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and i had some slight acquaintance with him. he was not generally popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence. in appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly manners. he was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated from the northern musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in western sussex, where the manor house of hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county. something of his birthplace seemed to cling to the man, and i never looked at his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without associating him with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. once or twice we drifted into talk, and i can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference. “for four years i had seen nothing of him until one morning he walked into my room in montague street. he had changed little, was dressed like a young man of fashion—he was always a bit of a dandy—and preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had formerly distinguished him. “‘how has all gone with you musgrave?’ i asked, after we had cordially shaken hands. “‘you probably heard of my poor father’s death,’ said he; ‘he was carried off about two years ago. since then i have of course had the hurlstone estates to manage, and as i am member for my district as well, my life has been a busy one. but i understand, holmes, that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us?’ “‘yes,’ said i, ‘i have taken to living by my wits.’ “‘i am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be exceedingly valuable to me. we have had some very strange doings at hurlstone, and the police have been able to throw no light upon the matter. it is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business.’ “you can imagine with what eagerness i listened to him, watson, for the very chance for which i had been panting during all those months of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. in my inmost heart i believed that i could succeed where others failed, and now i had the opportunity to test myself. “‘pray, let me have the details,’ i cried. “reginald musgrave sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette which i had pushed towards him. “‘you must know,’ said he, ‘that though i am a bachelor, i have to keep up a considerable staff of servants at hurlstone, for it is a rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after. i preserve, too, and in the pheasant months i usually have a house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. altogether there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy. the garden and the stables of course have a separate staff. “‘of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was brunton the butler. he was a young schoolmaster out of place when he was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of great energy and character, and he soon became quite invaluable in the household. he was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now. with his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts—for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument—it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a position, but i suppose that he was comfortable, and lacked energy to make any change. the butler of hurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by all who visit us. “‘but this paragon has one fault. he is a bit of a don juan, and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district. when he was married it was all right, but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble with him. a few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to settle down again for he became engaged to rachel howells, our second housemaid; but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with janet tregellis, the daughter of the head gamekeeper. rachel—who is a very good girl, but of an excitable welsh temperament—had a sharp touch of brain-fever, and goes about the house now—or did until yesterday—like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. that was our first drama at hurlstone; but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler brunton. “‘this was how it came about. i have said that the man was intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did not in the least concern him. i had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him, until the merest accident opened my eyes to it. “‘i have said that the house is a rambling one. one day last week—on thursday night, to be more exact—i found that i could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong _café noir_ after my dinner. after struggling against it until two in the morning, i felt that it was quite hopeless, so i rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which i was reading. the book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so i pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it. “‘in order to reach the billiard-room i had to descend a flight of stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to the library and the gun-room. you can imagine my surprise when, as i looked down this corridor, i saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door of the library. i had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed. naturally my first thought was of burglars. the corridors at hurlstone have their walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons. from one of these i picked a battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door. “‘brunton, the butler, was in the library. he was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked like a map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought. i stood dumb with astonishment, watching him from the darkness. a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. suddenly, as i looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. from this he took a paper, and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute attention. my indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that i took a step forward, and brunton, looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. he sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he had been originally studying. “‘“so!” said i. “this is how you repay the trust which we have reposed in you. you will leave my service to-morrow.” “‘he bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk past me without a word. the taper was still on the table, and by its light i glanced to see what the paper was which brunton had taken from the bureau. to my surprise it was nothing of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular old observance called the musgrave ritual. it is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which each musgrave for centuries past has gone through on his coming of age—a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever.’ “‘we had better come back to the paper afterwards,’ said i. “‘if you think it really necessary,’ he answered, with some hesitation. ‘to continue my statement, however: i relocked the bureau, using the key which brunton had left, and i had turned to go when i was surprised to find that the butler had returned, and was standing before me. “‘“mr. musgrave, sir,” he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with emotion, “i can’t bear disgrace, sir. i’ve always been proud above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. my blood will be on your head, sir—it will, indeed—if you drive me to despair. if you cannot keep me after what has passed, then for god’s sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. i could stand that, mr. musgrave, but not to be cast out before all the folk that i know so well.” “‘“you don’t deserve much consideration, brunton,” i answered. “your conduct has been most infamous. however, as you have been a long time in the family, i have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. a month, however is too long. take yourself away in a week, and give what reason you like for going.” “‘“only a week, sir?” he cried, in a despairing voice. “a fortnight—say at least a fortnight!” “‘“a week,” i repeated, “and you may consider yourself to have been very leniently dealt with.” “‘he crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken man, while i put out the light and returned to my room. “‘for two days after this brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. i made no allusion to what had passed, and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. on the third morning, however he did not appear, as was his custom, after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day. as i left the dining-room i happened to meet rachel howells, the maid. i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work. “‘“you should be in bed,” i said. “come back to your duties when you are stronger.” “‘she looked at me with so strange an expression that i began to suspect that her brain was affected. “‘“i am strong enough, mr. musgrave,” said she. “‘“we will see what the doctor says,” i answered. “you must stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say that i wish to see brunton.” “‘“the butler is gone,” said she. “‘“gone! gone where?” “‘“he is gone. no one has seen him. he is not in his room. oh, yes, he is gone, he is gone!” she fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter, while i, horrified at this sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. the girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while i made inquiries about brunton. there was no doubt about it that he had disappeared. his bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. his clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room, but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. his slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. where then could butler brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become of him now? “‘of course we searched the house from cellar to garret, but there was no trace of him. it is, as i have said, a labyrinth of an old house, especially the original wing, which is now practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar without discovering the least sign of the missing man. it was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him, and yet where could he be? i called in the local police, but without success. rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house, but in vain. matters were in this state, when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery. “‘for two days rachel howells had been so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse had been employed to sit up with her at night. on the third night after brunton’s disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping nicely, had dropped into a nap in the armchair, when she woke in the early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no signs of the invalid. i was instantly aroused, and, with the two footmen, started off at once in search of the missing girl. it was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for, starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanished close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds. the lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it. “‘of course, we had the drags at once, and set to work to recover the remains, but no trace of the body could we find. on the other hand, we brought to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind. it was a linen bag which contained within it a mass of old rusted and discoloured metal and several dull-coloured pieces of pebble or glass. this strange find was all that we could get from the mere, and, although we made every possible search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton. the county police are at their wits’ end, and i have come up to you as a last resource.’ “you can imagine, watson, with what eagerness i listened to this extraordinary sequence of events, and endeavoured to piece them together, and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang. the butler was gone. the maid was gone. the maid had loved the butler, but had afterwards had cause to hate him. she was of welsh blood, fiery and passionate. she had been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance. she had flung into the lake a bag containing some curious contents. these were all factors which had to be taken into consideration, and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter. what was the starting-point of this chain of events? there lay the end of this tangled line. “‘i must see that paper, musgrave,’ said i, ‘which this butler of yours thought it worth his while to consult, even at the risk of the loss of his place.’ “‘it is rather an absurd business, this ritual of ours,’ he answered. ‘but it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to excuse it. i have a copy of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them.’ “he handed me the very paper which i have here, watson, and this is the strange catechism to which each musgrave had to submit when he came to man’s estate. i will read you the questions and answers as they stand. “‘whose was it?’ “‘his who is gone.’ “‘who shall have it?’ “‘he who will come.’ “‘where was the sun?’ “‘over the oak.’ “‘where was the shadow?’ “‘under the elm.’ “how was it stepped?’ “‘north by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.’ “‘what shall we give for it?’ “‘all that is ours.’ “‘why should we give it?’ “‘for the sake of the trust.’ “‘the original has no date, but is in the spelling of the middle of the seventeenth century,’ remarked musgrave. ‘i am afraid, however, that it can be of little help to you in solving this mystery.’ “‘at least,’ said i, ‘it gives us another mystery, and one which is even more interesting than the first. it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other. you will excuse me, musgrave, if i say that your butler appears to me to have been a very clever man, and to have had a clearer insight than ten generations of his masters.’ “‘i hardly follow you,’ said musgrave. ‘the paper seems to me to be of no practical importance.’ “‘but to me it seems immensely practical, and i fancy that brunton took the same view. he had probably seen it before that night on which you caught him.’ “‘it is very possible. we took no pains to hide it.’ “‘he simply wished, i should imagine, to refresh his memory upon that last occasion. he had, as i understand, some sort of map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript, and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared.’ “‘that is true. but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?’ “‘i don’t think that we should have much difficulty in determining that,’ said i; ‘with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.’ “the same afternoon saw us both at hurlstone. possibly you have seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building, so i will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in the shape of an l, the long arm being the more modern portion, and the shorter the ancient nucleus, from which the other had developed. over the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of this old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are agreed that the beams and stonework are really much older than this. the enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar, when it was used at all. a splendid park with fine old timber surrounds the house, and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from the building. “i was already firmly convinced, watson, that there were not three separate mysteries here, but one only, and that if i could read the musgrave ritual aright i should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler brunton and the maid howells. to that then i turned all my energies. why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula? evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country squires, and from which he expected some personal advantage. what was it then, and how had it affected his fate? “it was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the ritual, that the measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document alluded, and that if we could find that spot, we should be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was which the old musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion. there were two guides given us to start with, an oak and an elm. as to the oak there could be no question at all. right in front of the house, upon the left-hand side of the drive, there stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen. “‘that was there when your ritual was drawn up,’ said i, as we drove past it. “‘it was there at the norman conquest in all probability,’ he answered. ‘it has a girth of twenty-three feet.’ “‘have you any old elms?’ i asked. “‘there used to be a very old one over yonder but it was struck by lightning ten years ago, and we cut down the stump.’ “‘you can see where it used to be?’ “‘oh, yes.’ “‘there are no other elms?’ “‘no old ones, but plenty of beeches.’ “‘i should like to see where it grew.’ “we had driven up in a dog-cart, and my client led me away at once, without our entering the house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had stood. it was nearly midway between the oak and the house. my investigation seemed to be progressing. “‘i suppose it is impossible to find out how high the elm was?’ i asked. “‘i can give you it at once. it was sixty-four feet.’ “‘how do you come to know it?’ i asked, in surprise. “‘when my old tutor used to give me an exercise in trigonometry, it always took the shape of measuring heights. when i was a lad i worked out every tree and building in the estate.’ “this was an unexpected piece of luck. my data were coming more quickly than i could have reasonably hoped. “‘tell me,’ i asked, ‘did your butler ever ask you such a question?’ “reginald musgrave looked at me in astonishment. ‘now that you call it to my mind,’ he answered, ‘brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some months ago, in connection with some little argument with the groom.’ “this was excellent news, watson, for it showed me that i was on the right road. i looked up at the sun. it was low in the heavens, and i calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak. one condition mentioned in the ritual would then be fulfilled. and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide. i had, then, to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak.” “that must have been difficult, holmes, when the elm was no longer there.” “well, at least i knew that if brunton could do it, i could also. besides, there was no real difficulty. i went with musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which i tied this long string with a knot at each yard. then i took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and i went back with my client to where the elm had been. the sun was just grazing the top of the oak. i fastened the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. it was nine feet in length. “of course the calculation now was a simple one. if a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other. i measured out the distance, which brought me almost to the wall of the house, and i thrust a peg into the spot. you can imagine my exultation, watson, when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground. i knew that it was the mark made by brunton in his measurements, and that i was still upon his trail. “from this starting-point i proceeded to step, having first taken the cardinal points by my pocket-compass. ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again i marked my spot with a peg. then i carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south. it brought me to the very threshold of the old door. two steps to the west meant now that i was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was the place indicated by the ritual. “never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment, watson. for a moment it seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations. the setting sun shone full upon the passage floor, and i could see that the old, foot-worn grey stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together, and had certainly not been moved for many a long year. brunton had not been at work here. i tapped upon the floor, but it sounded the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice. but, fortunately, musgrave, who had begun to appreciate the meaning of my proceedings, and who was now as excited as myself, took out his manuscript to check my calculation. “‘and under,’ he cried. ‘you have omitted the “and under.”’ “i had thought that it meant that we were to dig, but now, of course, i saw at once that i was wrong. ‘there is a cellar under this then?’ i cried. “‘yes, and as old as the house. down here, through this door.’ “we went down a winding stone stair, and my companion, striking a match, lit a large lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner. in an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place, and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently. “it had been used for the storage of wood, but the billets, which had evidently been littered over the floor, were now piled at the sides, so as to leave a clear space in the middle. in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rusted iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd’s-check muffler was attached. “‘by jove!’ cried my client. ‘that’s brunton’s muffler. i have seen it on him, and could swear to it. what has the villain been doing here?’ “at my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to be present, and i then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling on the cravat. i could only move it slightly, and it was with the aid of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side. a black hole yawned beneath into which we all peered, while musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the lantern. “a small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay open to us. at one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood, so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it. several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such as i hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it contained nothing else. “at the moment, however, we had no thought for the old chest, for our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it. it was the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on each side of it. the attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could have recognised that distorted liver-coloured countenance; but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. he had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end. when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started. “i confess that so far, watson, i had been disappointed in my investigation. i had reckoned upon solving the matter when once i had found the place referred to in the ritual; but now i was there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions. it is true that i had thrown a light upon the fate of brunton, but now i had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had disappeared. i sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over. “you know my methods in such cases, watson. i put myself in the man’s place and, having first gauged his intelligence, i try to imagine how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances. in this case the matter was simplified by brunton’s intelligence being quite first-rate, so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation, as the astronomers have dubbed it. he knew that something valuable was concealed. he had spotted the place. he found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided. what would he do next? he could not get help from outside, even if he had some one whom he could trust, without the unbarring of doors and considerable risk of detection. it was better, if he could, to have his helpmate inside the house. but whom could he ask? this girl had been devoted to him. a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman’s love, however badly he may have treated her. he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells, and then would engage her as his accomplice. together they would come at night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to raise the stone. so far i could follow their actions as if i had actually seen them. “but for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy work the raising of that stone. a burly sussex policeman and i had found it no light job. what would they do to assist them? probably what i should have done myself. i rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor. almost at once i came upon what i expected. one piece, about three feet in length, had a very marked indentation at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight. evidently, as they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of this other slab. so far i was still on safe ground. “and now how was i to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama? clearly, only one could fit into the hole, and that one was brunton. the girl must have waited above. brunton then unlocked the box, handed up the contents presumably—since they were not to be found—and then—and then what happened? “what smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate celtic woman’s soul when she saw the man who had wronged her—wronged her, perhaps, far more than we suspected—in her power? was it a chance that the wood had slipped, and that the stone had shut brunton into what had become his sepulchre? had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate? or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place? be that as it might, i seemed to see that woman’s figure still clutching at her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover’s life out. “here was the secret of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. but what had been in the box? what had she done with that? of course, it must have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged from the mere. she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime. “for twenty minutes i had sat motionless, thinking the matter out. musgrave still stood with a very pale face, swinging his lantern and peering down into the hole. “‘these are coins of charles the first,’ said he, holding out the few which had been in the box; ‘you see we were right in fixing our date for the ritual.’ “‘we may find something else of charles the first,’ i cried, as the probable meaning of the first two questions of the ritual broke suddenly upon me. ‘let me see the contents of the bag which you fished from the mere.’ “we ascended to his study, and he laid the _débris_ before me. i could understand his regarding it as of small importance when i looked at it, for the metal was almost black and the stones lustreless and dull. i rubbed one of them on my sleeve, however, and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand. the metal work was in the form of a double ring, but it had been bent and twisted out of its original shape. “‘you must bear in mind,’ said i, ‘that the royal party made head in england even after the death of the king, and that when they at last fled they probably left many of their most precious possessions buried behind them, with the intention of returning for them in more peaceful times.’ “‘my ancestor, sir ralph musgrave, was a prominent cavalier and the right-hand man of charles the second in his wanderings,’ said my friend. “‘ah, indeed!’ i answered. ‘well now, i think that really should give us the last link that we wanted. i must congratulate you on coming into the possession, though in rather a tragic manner of a relic which is of great intrinsic value, but of even greater importance as an historical curiosity.’ “‘what is it, then?’ he gasped in astonishment. “‘it is nothing less than the ancient crown of the kings of england.’ “‘the crown!’ “‘precisely. consider what the ritual says: how does it run? “whose was it?” “his who is gone.” that was after the execution of charles. then, “who shall have it?” “he who will come.” that was charles the second, whose advent was already foreseen. there can, i think, be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem once encircled the brows of the royal stuarts.’ “‘and how came it in the pond?’ “‘ah, that is a question that will take some time to answer.’ and with that i sketched out to him the whole long chain of surmise and of proof which i had constructed. the twilight had closed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished. “‘and how was it then that charles did not get his crown when he returned?’ asked musgrave, pushing back the relic into its linen bag. “‘ah, there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall probably never be able to clear up. it is likely that the musgrave who held the secret died in the interval, and by some oversight left this guide to his descendant without explaining the meaning of it. from that day to this it has been handed down from father to son, until at last it came within reach of a man who tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the venture.’ “and that’s the story of the musgrave ritual, watson. they have the crown down at hurlstone—though they had some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it. i am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you. of the woman nothing was ever heard, and the probability is that she got away out of england and carried herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas.” vii. the reigate squires it was some time before the health of my friend mr. sherlock holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring of ’87. the whole question of the netherland-sumatra company and of the colossal schemes of baron maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public, and are too intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting subjects for this series of sketches. they led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle against crime. on referring to my notes i see that it was upon the 14th of april that i received a telegram from lyons which informed me that holmes was lying ill in the hotel dulong. within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms. even his iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months, during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. even the triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when europe was ringing with his name and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams i found him a prey to the blackest depression. even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and that he had outmanœuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration. three days later we were back in baker street together; but it was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change, and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full of attractions to me also. my old friend, colonel hayter, who had come under my professional care in afghanistan, had now taken a house near reigate in surrey, and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit. on the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also. a little diplomacy was needed, but when holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from lyons we were under the colonel’s roof. hayter was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as i had expected, that holmes and he had much in common. on the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the colonel’s gun-room after dinner, holmes stretched upon the sofa, while hayter and i looked over his little armoury of fire-arms. “by the way,” said he suddenly, “i think i’ll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.” “an alarm!” said i. “yes, we’ve had a scare in this part lately. old acton, who is one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last monday. no great damage done, but the fellows are still at large.” “no clue?” asked holmes, cocking his eye at the colonel. “none as yet. but the affair is a petty one, one of our little country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, mr. holmes, after this great international affair.” holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it had pleased him. “was there any feature of interest?” “i fancy not. the thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains. the whole place was turned upside down, drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that an odd volume of pope’s ‘homer,’ two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that have vanished.” “what an extraordinary assortment!” i exclaimed. “oh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could get.” holmes grunted from the sofa. “the county police ought to make something of that,” said he; “why, it is surely obvious that—” but i held up a warning finger. “you are here for a rest, my dear fellow. for heaven’s sake don’t get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds.” holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel, and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels. it was destined, however, that all my professional caution should be wasted, for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our country visit took a turn which neither of us could have anticipated. we were at breakfast when the colonel’s butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him. “have you heard the news, sir?” he gasped. “at the cunningham’s sir!” “burglary!” cried the colonel, with his coffee-cup in mid-air. “murder!” the colonel whistled. “by jove!” said he. “who’s killed, then? the j.p. or his son?” “neither, sir. it was william the coachman. shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke again.” “who shot him, then?” “the burglar, sir. he was off like a shot and got clean away. he’d just broke in at the pantry window when william came on him and met his end in saving his master’s property.” “what time?” “it was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.” “ah, then, we’ll step over afterwards,” said the colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast again. “it’s a baddish business,” he added when the butler had gone; “he’s our leading man about here, is old cunningham, and a very decent fellow too. he’ll be cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant. it’s evidently the same villains who broke into acton’s.” “and stole that very singular collection,” said holmes, thoughtfully. “precisely.” “hum! it may prove the simplest matter in the world, but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not? a gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days. when you spoke last night of taking precautions i remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in england to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention—which shows that i have still much to learn.” “i fancy it’s some local practitioner,” said the colonel. “in that case, of course, acton’s and cunningham’s are just the places he would go for, since they are far the largest about here.” “and richest?” “well, they ought to be, but they’ve had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them, i fancy. old acton has some claim on half cunningham’s estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both hands.” “if it’s a local villain there should not be much difficulty in running him down,” said holmes with a yawn. “all right, watson, i don’t intend to meddle.” “inspector forrester, sir,” said the butler, throwing open the door. the official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the room. “good-morning, colonel,” said he; “i hope i don’t intrude, but we hear that mr. holmes of baker street is here.” the colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the inspector bowed. “we thought that perhaps you would care to step across, mr. holmes.” “the fates are against you, watson,” said he, laughing. “we were chatting about the matter when you came in, inspector. perhaps you can let us have a few details.” as he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude i knew that the case was hopeless. “we had no clue in the acton affair. but here we have plenty to go on, and there’s no doubt it is the same party in each case. the man was seen.” “ah!” “yes, sir. but he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor william kirwan was fired. mr. cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and mr. alec cunningham saw him from the back passage. it was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. mr. cunningham had just got into bed, and mr. alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. they both heard william the coachman calling for help, and mr. alec ran down to see what was the matter. the back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. one of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. mr. cunningham, looking out of his bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. mr. alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.” “what was this william doing there? did he say anything before he died?” “not a word. he lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. of course this acton business has put every one on their guard. the robber must have just burst open the door—the lock has been forced—when william came upon him.” “did william say anything to his mother before going out?” “she is very old and deaf, and we can get no information from her. the shock has made her half-witted, but i understand that she was never very bright. there is one very important circumstance, however. look at this!” he took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee. “this was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. it appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. you will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate. you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. it reads almost as though it were an appointment.” holmes took up the scrap of paper, a facsimile of which is here reproduced. scrap of paper “presuming that it is an appointment,” continued the inspector, “it is of course a conceivable theory that this william kirwan—though he had the reputation of being an honest man, may have been in league with the thief. he may have met him there, may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may have fallen out between themselves.” “this writing is of extraordinary interest,” said holmes, who had been examining it with intense concentration. “these are much deeper waters than i had thought.” he sank his head upon his hands, while the inspector smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the famous london specialist. “your last remark,” said holmes, presently, “as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition. but this writing opens up—” he sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought. when he raised his face again, i was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with colour, and his eyes as bright as before his illness. he sprang to his feet with all his old energy. “i’ll tell you what,” said he, “i should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case. there is something in it which fascinates me extremely. if you will permit me, colonel, i will leave my friend watson and you, and i will step round with the inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine. i will be with you again in half an hour.” an hour and half had elapsed before the inspector returned alone. “mr. holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,” said he. “he wants us all four to go up to the house together.” “to mr. cunningham’s?” “yes, sir.” “what for?” the inspector shrugged his shoulders. “i don’t quite know, sir. between ourselves, i think mr. holmes had not quite got over his illness yet. he’s been behaving very queerly, and he is very much excited.” “i don’t think you need alarm yourself,” said i. “i have usually found that there was method in his madness.” “some folks might say there was madness in his method,” muttered the inspector. “but he’s all on fire to start, colonel, so we had best go out if you are ready.” we found holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets. “the matter grows in interest,” said he. “watson, your country-trip has been a distinct success. i have had a charming morning.” “you have been up to the scene of the crime, i understand,” said the colonel. “yes; the inspector and i have made quite a little reconnaissance together.” “any success?” “well, we have seen some very interesting things. i’ll tell you what we did as we walk. first of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man. he certainly died from a revolver wound as reported.” “had you doubted it, then?” “oh, it is as well to test everything. our inspection was not wasted. we then had an interview with mr. cunningham and his son, who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden-hedge in his flight. that was of great interest.” “naturally.” “then we had a look at this poor fellow’s mother. we could get no information from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.” “and what is the result of your investigations?” “the conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one. perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure. i think that we are both agreed, inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man’s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his death written upon it, is of extreme importance.” “it should give a clue, mr. holmes.” “it _does_ give a clue. whoever wrote that note was the man who brought william kirwan out of his bed at that hour. but where is the rest of that sheet of paper?” “i examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,” said the inspector. “it was torn out of the dead man’s hand. why was some one so anxious to get possession of it? because it incriminated him. and what would he do with it? thrust it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. if we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.” “yes, but how can we get at the criminal’s pocket before we catch the criminal?” “well, well, it was worth thinking over. then there is another obvious point. the note was sent to william. the man who wrote it could not have taken it; otherwise, of course, he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth. who brought the note, then? or did it come through the post?” “i have made inquiries,” said the inspector. “william received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. the envelope was destroyed by him.” “excellent!” cried holmes, clapping the inspector on the back. “you’ve seen the postman. it is a pleasure to work with you. well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, colonel, i will show you the scene of the crime.” we passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old queen anne house, which bears the date of malplaquet upon the lintel of the door. holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. a constable was standing at the kitchen door. “throw the door open, officer,” said holmes. “now, it was on those stairs that young mr. cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. old mr. cunningham was at that window—the second on the left—and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. then mr. alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man. the ground is very hard, you see, and there are no marks to guide us.” as he spoke two men came down the garden path, from round the angle of the house. the one was an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contrast with the business which had brought us there. “still at it, then?” said he to holmes. “i thought you londoners were never at fault. you don’t seem to be so very quick, after all.” “ah, you must give us a little time,” said holmes good-humoredly. “you’ll want it,” said young alec cunningham. “why, i don’t see that we have any clue at all.” “there’s only one,” answered the inspector. “we thought that if we could only find—good heavens, mr. holmes! what is the matter?” my poor friend’s face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression. his eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a large chair, and breathed heavily for some minutes. finally, with a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more. “watson would tell you that i have only just recovered from a severe illness,” he explained. “i am liable to these sudden nervous attacks.” “shall i send you home in my trap?” asked old cunningham. “well, since i am here, there is one point on which i should like to feel sure. we can very easily verify it.” “what was it?” “well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow william was not before, but after, the entrance of the burglar into the house. you appear to take it for granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got in.” “i fancy that is quite obvious,” said mr. cunningham, gravely. “why, my son alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard any one moving about.” “where was he sitting?” “i was smoking in my dressing-room.” “which window is that?” “the last on the left next my father’s.” “both of your lamps were lit, of course?” “undoubtedly.” “there are some very singular points here,” said holmes, smiling. “is it not extraordinary that a burglar—and a burglar who had had some previous experience—should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?” “he must have been a cool hand.” “well, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation,” said young mr. alec. “but as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house before william tackled him, i think it a most absurd notion. wouldn’t we have found the place disarranged, and missed the things which he had taken?” “it depends on what the things were,” said holmes. “you must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from acton’s—what was it?—a ball of string, a letter-weight, and i don’t know what other odds and ends.” “well, we are quite in your hands, mr. holmes,” said old cunningham. “anything which you or the inspector may suggest will most certainly be done.” “in the first place,” said holmes, “i should like you to offer a reward—coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. i have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. fifty pounds was quite enough, i thought.” “i would willingly give five hundred,” said the j.p., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which holmes handed to him. “this is not quite correct, however,” he added, glancing over the document. “i wrote it rather hurriedly.” “you see you begin, ‘whereas, at about a quarter to one on tuesday morning an attempt was made,’ and so on. it was at a quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.” i was pained at the mistake, for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind. it was his specialty to be accurate as to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself. he was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while the inspector raised his eyebrows, and alec cunningham burst into a laugh. the old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and handed the paper back to holmes. “get it printed as soon as possible,” he said; “i think your idea is an excellent one.” holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket-book. “and now,” said he, “it really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.” before entering, holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced. it was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. we could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in. “you don’t use bars, then?” he asked. “we have never found it necessary.” “you don’t keep a dog?” “yes, but he is chained on the other side of the house.” “when do the servants go to bed?” “about ten.” “i understand that william was usually in bed also at that hour.” “yes.” “it is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. now, i should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house, mr. cunningham.” a stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house. it came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including those of mr. cunningham and his son. holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of the architecture of the house. i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him. “my good sir,” said mr. cunningham with some impatience, “this is surely very unnecessary. that is my room at the end of the stairs, and my son’s is the one beyond it. i leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us.” “you must try round and get on a fresh scent, i fancy,” said the son with a rather malicious smile. “still, i must ask you to humour me a little further. i should like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front. this, i understand is your son’s room”—he pushed open the door—“and that, i presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. where does the window of that look out to?” he stepped across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber. “i hope that you are satisfied now?” said mr. cunningham, tartly. “thank you, i think i have seen all that i wished.” “then if it is really necessary we can go into my room.” “if it is not too much trouble.” the j.p. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. as we moved across it in the direction of the window, holmes fell back until he and i were the last of the group. near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. as we passed it holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room. “you’ve done it now, watson,” said he, coolly. “a pretty mess you’ve made of the carpet.” i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit, understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself. the others did the same, and set the table on its legs again. “halloa!” cried the inspector, “where’s he got to?” holmes had disappeared. “wait here an instant,” said young alec cunningham. “the fellow is off his head, in my opinion. come with me, father, and see where he has got to!” they rushed out of the room, leaving the inspector, the colonel, and me staring at each other. “’pon my word, i am inclined to agree with master alec,” said the official. “it may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to me that—” his words were cut short by a sudden scream of “help! help! murder!” with a thrill i recognised the voice of that of my friend. i rushed madly from the room on to the landing. the cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room which we had first visited. i dashed in, and on into the dressing-room beyond. the two cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of sherlock holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists. in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him, and holmes staggered to his feet, very pale and evidently greatly exhausted. “arrest these men, inspector!” he gasped. “on what charge?” “that of murdering their coachman, william kirwan!” the inspector stared about him in bewilderment. “oh, come now, mr. holmes,” said he at last, “i’m sure you don’t really mean to—” “tut, man, look at their faces!” cried holmes, curtly. never, certainly, have i seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances. the older man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. the son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features. the inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door, he blew his whistle. two of his constables came at the call. “i have no alternative, mr. cunningham,” said he. “i trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake, but you can see that—ah, would you? drop it!” he struck out with his hand, and a revolver which the younger man was in the act of cocking clattered down upon the floor. “keep that,” said holmes, quietly putting his foot upon it; “you will find it useful at the trial. but this is what we really wanted.” he held up a little crumpled piece of paper. “the remainder of the sheet!” cried the inspector. “precisely.” “and where was it?” “where i was sure it must be. i’ll make the whole matter clear to you presently. i think, colonel, that you and watson might return now, and i will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. the inspector and i must have a word with the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time.” sherlock holmes was as good as his word, for about one o’clock he rejoined us in the colonel’s smoking-room. he was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the mr. acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary. “i wished mr. acton to be present while i demonstrated this small matter to you,” said holmes, “for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. i am afraid, my dear colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as i am.” “on the contrary,” answered the colonel, warmly, “i consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. i confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that i am utterly unable to account for your result. i have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.” “i am afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them. but, first, as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room, i think that i shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, colonel. my strength has been rather tried of late.” “i trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks.” sherlock holmes laughed heartily. “we will come to that in its turn,” said he. “i will lay an account of the case before you in its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in my decision. pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you. “it is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognise, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital. otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated. now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man’s hand. “before going into this, i would draw your attention to the fact that, if alec cunningham’s narrative was correct, and if the assailant, after shooting william kirwan, had _instantly_ fled, then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man’s hand. but if it was not he, it must have been alec cunningham himself, for by the time that the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. the point is a simple one, but the inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter. now, i make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the investigation, i found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by mr. alec cunningham. “and now i made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the inspector had submitted to us. it was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. here it is. do you not now observe something very suggestive about it?” “it has a very irregular look,” said the colonel. “my dear sir,” cried holmes, “there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words. when i draw your attention to the strong t’s of ‘at’ and ‘to’, and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of ‘quarter’ and ‘twelve,’ you will instantly recognise the fact. a very brief analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the ‘learn’ and the ‘maybe’ are written in the stronger hand, and the ‘what’ in the weaker.” “by jove, it’s as clear as day!” cried the colonel. “why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?” “obviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each should have an equal hand in it. now, of the two men, it is clear that the one who wrote the ‘at’ and ‘to’ was the ringleader.” “how do you get at that?” “we might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other. but we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up. these blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his ‘quarter’ in between the ‘at’ and the ‘to,’ showing that the latter were already written. the man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned the affair.” “excellent!” cried mr. acton. “but very superficial,” said holmes. “we come now, however, to a point which is of importance. you may not be aware that the deduction of a man’s age from his writing is one which has been brought to considerable accuracy by experts. in normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. i say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. in this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility although the t’s have begun to lose their crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.” “excellent!” cried mr. acton again. “there is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest. there is something in common between these hands. they belong to men who are blood-relatives. it may be most obvious to you in the greek e’s, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. i have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. i am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. there were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. they all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter. “having got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into the details of the crime, and to see how far they would help us. i went up to the house with the inspector, and saw all that was to be seen. the wound upon the dead man was, as i was able to determine with absolute confidence, fired from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards. there was no powder-blackening on the clothes. evidently, therefore, alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired. again, both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. at that point, however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the bottom. as there were no indications of bootmarks about this ditch, i was absolutely sure not only that the cunninghams had again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon the scene at all. “and now i have to consider the motive of this singular crime. to get at this, i endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at mr. acton’s. i understood, from something which the colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been going on between you, mr. acton, and the cunninghams. of course, it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case.” “precisely so,” said mr. acton. “there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions. i have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate, and if they could have found a single paper—which, fortunately, was in the strong-box of my solicitors—they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.” “there you are,” said holmes, smiling. “it was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which i seem to trace the influence of young alec. having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. that is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. what i wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man’s hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. where else could he have put it? the only question was whether it was still there. it was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house. “the cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door. it was, of course, of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. the inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, i tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation. “good heavens!” cried the colonel, laughing, “do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?” “speaking professionally, it was admirably done,” cried i, looking in amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new phase of his astuteness. “it is an art which is often useful,” said he. “when i recovered i managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity, to get old cunningham to write the word ‘twelve,’ so that i might compare it with the ‘twelve’ upon the paper.” “oh, what an ass i have been!” i exclaimed. “i could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness,” said holmes, laughing. “i was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which i know that you felt. we then went upstairs together, and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, i contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. i had hardly got the paper, however—which was, as i had expected, in one of them—when the two cunninghams were on me, and would, i verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid. as it is, i feel that young man’s grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. they saw that i must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate. “i had a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. he was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else’s brains if he could have got to his revolver. when cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything. it seems that william had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon mr. acton’s, and having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail upon them. mr. alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. it was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. william was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.” “and the note?” i asked. sherlock holmes placed the subjoined paper before us. piece of paper if you will only come round at quarter to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much surprise you and maybe be of the greatest service to you and also to annie morrison. but say nothing to anyone upon the matter “it is very much the sort of thing that i expected,” said he. “of course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between alec cunningham, william kirwan, and annie morrison. the results shows that the trap was skillfully baited. i am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p’s and in the tails of the g’s. the absence of the i-dots in the old man’s writing is also most characteristic. watson, i think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and i shall certainly return much invigorated to baker street to-morrow.” viii. the crooked man one summer night, a few months after my marriage, i was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day’s work had been an exhausting one. my wife had already gone upstairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired. i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell. i looked at the clock. it was a quarter to twelve. this could not be a visitor at so late an hour. a patient, evidently, and possibly an all-night sitting. with a wry face i went out into the hall and opened the door. to my astonishment it was sherlock holmes who stood upon my step. “ah, watson,” said he, “i hoped that i might not be too late to catch you.” “my dear fellow, pray come in.” “you look surprised, and no wonder! relieved, too, i fancy! hum! you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! there’s no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat. it’s easy to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, watson. you’ll never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve. could you put me up to-night?” “with pleasure.” “you told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and i see that you have no gentleman visitor at present. your hat-stand proclaims as much.” “i shall be delighted if you will stay.” “thank you. i’ll fill the vacant peg then. sorry to see that you’ve had the british workman in the house. he’s a token of evil. not the drains, i hope?” “no, the gas.” “ah! he has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. no, thank you, i had some supper at waterloo, but i’ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.” i handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence. i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour, so i waited patiently until he should come round to it. “i see that you are professionally rather busy just now,” said he, glancing very keenly across at me. “yes, i’ve had a busy day,” i answered. “it may seem very foolish in your eyes,” i added, “but really i don’t know how you deduced it.” holmes chuckled to himself. “i have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear watson,” said he. “when your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. as i perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, i cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom.” “excellent!” i cried. “elementary,” said he. “it is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. the same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader. now, at present i am in the position of these same readers, for i hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man’s brain, and yet i lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory. but i’ll have them, watson, i’ll have them!” his eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks. for an instant only. when i glanced again his face had resumed that red-indian composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man. “the problem presents features of interest,” said he. “i may even say exceptional features of interest. i have already looked into the matter, and have come, as i think, within sight of my solution. if you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me.” “i should be delighted.” “could you go as far as aldershot to-morrow?” “i have no doubt jackson would take my practice.” “very good. i want to start by the 11.10 from waterloo.” “that would give me time.” “then, if you are not too sleepy, i will give you a sketch of what has happened, and of what remains to be done.” “i was sleepy before you came. i am quite wakeful now.” “i will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case. it is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter. it is the supposed murder of colonel barclay, of the royal mallows, at aldershot, which i am investigating.” “i have heard nothing of it.” “it has not excited much attention yet, except locally. the facts are only two days old. briefly they are these: “the royal mallows is, as you know, one of the most famous irish regiments in the british army. it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. it was commanded up to monday night by james barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket. “colonel barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden name was miss nancy devoy, was the daughter of a former colour-sergeant in the same corps. there was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple (for they were still young) found themselves in their new surroundings. they appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves, and mrs. barclay has always, i understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his brother officers. i may add that she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance. “colonel barclay’s family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. major murphy, to whom i owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. on the whole, he thinks that barclay’s devotion to his wife was greater than his wife’s to barclay. he was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. she, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. but they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. there was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow. “colonel barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character. he was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. this side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. another fact, which had struck major murphy and three out of five of the other officers with whom i conversed, was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times. as the major expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gayeties and chaff of the mess-table. for days on end, when the mood was on him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. this and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his brother officers had observed. the latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark. this puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and conjecture. “the first battalion of the royal mallows (which is the old 117th) has been stationed at aldershot for some years. the married officers live out of barracks, and the colonel has during all this time occupied a villa called lachine, about half a mile from the north camp. the house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the high-road. a coachman and two maids form the staff of servants. these with their master and mistress were the sole occupants of lachine, for the barclays had no children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors. “now for the events at lachine between nine and ten on the evening of last monday.” “mrs. barclay was, it appears, a member of the roman catholic church, and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the guild of st. george, which was formed in connection with the watt street chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off clothing. a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight, and mrs. barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it. when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would be back before very long. she then called for miss morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went off together to their meeting. it lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine mrs. barclay returned home, having left miss morrison at her door as she passed. “there is a room which is used as a morning-room at lachine. this faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the lawn. the lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. it was into this room that mrs. barclay went upon her return. the blinds were not down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but mrs. barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking jane stewart, the housemaid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual habits. the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room, but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the morning-room. the coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it. he was never seen again alive. “the tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. she knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside. naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging. they all agreed that only two voices were to be heard, those of barclay and of his wife. barclay’s remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners. the lady’s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her voice could be plainly heard. ‘you coward!’ she repeated over and over again. ‘what can be done now? what can be done now? give me back my life. i will never so much as breathe the same air with you again! you coward! you coward!’ those were scraps of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man’s voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman. convinced that some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it, while scream after scream issued from within. he was unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him. a sudden thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and round to the lawn upon which the long french windows open. one side of the window was open, which i understand was quite usual in the summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room. his mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an armchair, and his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood. “naturally, the coachman’s first thought, on finding that he could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. but here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. the key was not in the inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. he went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned. the lady, against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a state of insensibility. the colonel’s body was then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy. “the injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt weapon. nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have been. upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. the colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies. the servants deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked. nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon mrs. barclay’s person nor upon that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to be found. the door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from aldershot. “that was the state of things, watson, when upon the tuesday morning i, at the request of major murphy, went down to aldershot to supplement the efforts of the police. i think that you will acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more extraordinary than would at first sight appear. “before examining the room i cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which i have already stated. one other detail of interest was remembered by jane stewart, the housemaid. you will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. on that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they had fallen out. on my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word ‘david’ uttered twice by the lady. the point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. the colonel’s name, you remember, was james. “there was one thing in the case which had made the deepest impression both upon the servants and the police. this was the contortion of the colonel’s face. it had set, according to their account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming. more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. it was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused him the utmost horror. this, of course, fitted in well enough with the police theory, if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him. nor was the fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid the blow. no information could be got from the lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of brain-fever. “from the police i learned that miss morrison, who you remember went out that evening with mrs. barclay, denied having any knowledge of what it was which had caused the ill-humour in which her companion had returned. “having gathered these facts, watson, i smoked several pipes over them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which were merely incidental. there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door-key. a most careful search had failed to discover it in the room. therefore it must have been taken from it. but neither the colonel nor the colonel’s wife could have taken it. that was perfectly clear. therefore a third person must have entered the room. and that third person could only have come in through the window. it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. you know my methods, watson. there was not one of them which i did not apply to the inquiry. and it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which i had expected. there had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road. i was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his footmarks: one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered. he had apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper than his heels. but it was not the man who surprised me. it was his companion.” “his companion!” holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee. “what do you make of that?” he asked. the paper was covered with the tracings of the footmarks of some small animal. it had five well-marked footpads, an indication of long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as a dessert-spoon. “it’s a dog,” said i. “did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain? i found distinct traces that this creature had done so.” “a monkey, then?” “but it is not the print of a monkey.” “what can it be, then?” “neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar with. i have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements. here are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless. you see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not much less than two feet long—probably more if there is any tail. but now observe this other measurement. the animal has been moving, and we have the length of its stride. in each case it is only about three inches. you have an indication, you see, of a long body with very short legs attached to it. it has not been considerate enough to leave any of its hair behind it. but its general shape must be what i have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is carnivorous.” “how do you deduce that?” “because it ran up the curtain. a canary’s cage was hanging in the window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird.” “then what was the beast?” “ah, if i could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving the case. on the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel and stoat tribe—and yet it is larger than any of these that i have seen.” “but what had it to do with the crime?” “that, also, is still obscure. but we have learned a good deal, you perceive. we know that a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel between the barclays—the blinds were up and the room lighted. we know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the colonel or, as is equally possible, that the colonel fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of the fender. finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left.” “your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it was before,” said i. “quite so. they undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper than was at first conjectured. i thought the matter over, and i came to the conclusion that i must approach the case from another aspect. but really, watson, i am keeping you up, and i might just as well tell you all this on our way to aldershot to-morrow.” “thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop.” “it is quite certain that when mrs. barclay left the house at half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband. she was never, as i think i have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion. now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally, on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o’clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him. but miss morrison had been with her during the whole of that hour and a half. it was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her denial, that she must know something of the matter. “my first conjecture was, that possibly there had been some passages between this young lady and the old soldier, which the former had now confessed to the wife. that would account for the angry return, and also for the girl’s denial that anything had occurred. nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overheard. but there was the reference to david, and there was the known affection of the colonel for his wife, to weigh against it, to say nothing of the tragic intrusion of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with what had gone before. it was not easy to pick one’s steps, but, on the whole, i was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been anything between the colonel and miss morrison, but more than ever convinced that the young lady held the clue as to what it was which had turned mrs. barclay to hatred of her husband. i took the obvious course, therefore, of calling upon miss morrison, of explaining to her that i was perfectly certain that she held the facts in her possession, and of assuring her that her friend, mrs. barclay, might find herself in the dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were cleared up. “miss morrison is a little, ethereal slip of a girl, with timid eyes and blonde hair, but i found her by no means wanting in shrewdness and common sense. she sat thinking for some time after i had spoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement which i will condense for your benefit. “‘i promised my friend that i would say nothing of the matter, and a promise is a promise,’ said she; ‘but if i can really help her when so serious a charge is laid against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then i think i am absolved from my promise. i will tell you exactly what happened upon monday evening. “‘we were returning from the watt street mission about a quarter to nine o’clock. on our way we had to pass through hudson street, which is a very quiet thoroughfare. there is only one lamp in it, upon the left-hand side, and as we approached this lamp i saw a man coming towards us with his back very bent, and something like a box slung over one of his shoulders. he appeared to be deformed, for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent. we were passing him when he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, “my god, it’s nancy!” mrs. barclay turned as white as death, and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking creature not caught hold of her. i was going to call for the police, but she, to my surprise, spoke quite civilly to the fellow. “‘“i thought you had been dead this thirty years, henry,” said she, in a shaking voice. “‘“so i have,” said he, and it was awful to hear the tones that he said it in. he had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams. his hair and whiskers were shot with grey, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple. “‘“just walk on a little way, dear,” said mrs. barclay; “i want to have a word with this man. there is nothing to be afraid of.” she tried to speak boldly, but she was still deadly pale and could hardly get her words out for the trembling of her lips. “‘i did as she asked me, and they talked together for a few minutes. then she came down the street with her eyes blazing, and i saw the crippled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shaking his clenched fists in the air as if he were mad with rage. she never said a word until we were at the door here, when she took me by the hand and begged me to tell no one what had happened. “‘“it’s an old acquaintance of mine who has come down in the world,” said she. when i promised her i would say nothing she kissed me, and i have never seen her since. i have told you now the whole truth, and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend stood. i know that it can only be to her advantage that everything should be known.’ “there was her statement, watson, and to me, as you can imagine, it was like a light on a dark night. everything which had been disconnected before began at once to assume its true place, and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events. my next step obviously was to find the man who had produced such a remarkable impression upon mrs. barclay. if he were still in aldershot it should not be a very difficult matter. there are not such a very great number of civilians, and a deformed man was sure to have attracted attention. i spent a day in the search, and by evening—this very evening, watson—i had run him down. the man’s name is henry wood, and he lives in lodgings in this same street in which the ladies met him. he has only been five days in the place. in the character of a registration-agent i had a most interesting gossip with his landlady. the man is by trade a conjurer and performer, going round the canteens after nightfall, and giving a little entertainment at each. he carries some creature about with him in that box; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she had never seen an animal like it. he uses it in some of his tricks according to her account. so much the woman was able to tell me, and also that it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights she had heard him groaning and weeping in his bedroom. he was all right, as far as money went, but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin. she showed it to me, watson, and it was an indian rupee. “so now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how we stand and why it is i want you. it is perfectly plain that after the ladies parted from this man he followed them at a distance, that he saw the quarrel between husband and wife through the window, that he rushed in, and that the creature which he carried in his box got loose. that is all very certain. but he is the only person in this world who can tell us exactly what happened in that room.” “and you intend to ask him?” “most certainly—but in the presence of a witness.” “and i am the witness?” “if you will be so good. if he can clear the matter up, well and good. if he refuses, we have no alternative but to apply for a warrant.” “but how do you know he’ll be there when we return?” “you may be sure that i took some precautions. i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr, go where he might. we shall find him in hudson street to-morrow, watson, and meanwhile i should be the criminal myself if i kept you out of bed any longer.” it was midday when we found ourselves at the scene of the tragedy, and, under my companion’s guidance, we made our way at once to hudson street. in spite of his capacity for concealing his emotions, i could easily see that holmes was in a state of suppressed excitement, while i was myself tingling with that half-sporting, half-intellectual pleasure which i invariably experienced when i associated myself with him in his investigations. “this is the street,” said he, as we turned into a short thoroughfare lined with plain two-storied brick houses. “ah, here is simpson to report.” “he’s in all right, mr. holmes,” cried a small street arab, running up to us. “good, simpson!” said holmes, patting him on the head. “come along, watson. this is the house.” he sent in his card with a message that he had come on important business, and a moment later we were face to face with the man whom we had come to see. in spite of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire, and the little room was like an oven. the man sat all twisted and huddled in his chair in a way which gave an indescribable impression of deformity; but the face which he turned towards us, though worn and swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable for its beauty. he looked suspiciously at us now out of yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or rising, he waved towards two chairs. “mr. henry wood, late of india, i believe,” said holmes, affably. “i’ve come over this little matter of colonel barclay’s death.” “what should i know about that?” “that’s what i want to ascertain. you know, i suppose, that unless the matter is cleared up, mrs. barclay, who is an old friend of yours, will in all probability be tried for murder.” the man gave a violent start. “i don’t know who you are,” he cried, “nor how you come to know what you do know, but will you swear that this is true that you tell me?” “why, they are only waiting for her to come to her senses to arrest her.” “my god! are you in the police yourself?” “no.” “what business is it of yours, then?” “it’s every man’s business to see justice done.” “you can take my word that she is innocent.” “then you are guilty.” “no, i am not.” “who killed colonel james barclay, then?” “it was a just providence that killed him. but, mind you this, that if i had knocked his brains out, as it was in my heart to do, he would have had no more than his due from my hands. if his own guilty conscience had not struck him down it is likely enough that i might have had his blood upon my soul. you want me to tell the story. well, i don’t know why i shouldn’t, for there’s no cause for me to be ashamed of it. “it was in this way, sir. you see me now with my back like a camel and my ribs all awry, but there was a time when corporal henry wood was the smartest man in the 117th foot. we were in india then, in cantonments, at a place we’ll call bhurtee. barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment, ay, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips, was nancy devoy, the daughter of the colour-sergeant. there were two men that loved her, and one that she loved, and you’ll smile when you look at this poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me. “well, though i had her heart, her father was set upon her marrying barclay. i was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. but the girl held true to me, and it seemed that i would have had her when the mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country. “we were shut up in bhurtee, the regiment of us with half a battery of artillery, a company of sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. there were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. about the second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question whether we could communicate with general neill’s column, which was moving up country. it was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so i volunteered to go out and to warn general neill of our danger. my offer was accepted, and i talked it over with sergeant barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and who drew up a route by which i might get through the rebel lines. at ten o’clock the same night i started off upon my journey. there were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night. “my way ran down a dried-up watercourse, which we hoped would screen me from the enemy’s sentries; but as i crept round the corner of it i walked right into six of them, who were crouching down in the dark waiting for me. in an instant i was stunned with a blow and bound hand and foot. but the real blow was to my heart and not to my head, for as i came to and listened to as much as i could understand of their talk, i heard enough to tell me that my comrade, the very man who had arranged the way that i was to take, had betrayed me by means of a native servant into the hands of the enemy. “well, there’s no need for me to dwell on that part of it. you know now what james barclay was capable of. bhurtee was relieved by neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their retreat, and it was many a long year before ever i saw a white face again. i was tortured and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. you can see for yourselves the state in which i was left. some of them that fled into nepaul took me with them, and then afterwards i was up past darjeeling. the hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and i became their slave for a time until i escaped; but instead of going south i had to go north, until i found myself among the afghans. there i wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to the punjab, where i lived mostly among the natives and picked up a living by the conjuring tricks that i had learned. what use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to england or to make myself known to my old comrades? even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. i had rather that nancy and my old pals should think of harry wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. they never doubted that i was dead, and i meant that they never should. i heard that barclay had married nancy, and that he was rising rapidly in the regiment, but even that did not make me speak. “but when one gets old one has a longing for home. for years i’ve been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of england. at last i determined to see them before i died. i saved enough to bring me across, and then i came here where the soldiers are, for i know their ways and how to amuse them and so earn enough to keep me.” “your narrative is most interesting,” said sherlock holmes. “i have already heard of your meeting with mrs. barclay, and your mutual recognition. you then, as i understand, followed her home and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth. your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn and broke in upon them.” “i did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as i have never seen a man look before, and over he went with his head on the fender. but he was dead before he fell. i read death on his face as plain as i can read that text over the fire. the bare sight of me was like a bullet through his guilty heart.” “and then?” “then nancy fainted, and i caught up the key of the door from her hand, intending to unlock it and get help. but as i was doing it it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing might look black against me, and any way my secret would be out if i were taken. in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my stick while i was chasing teddy, who had run up the curtain. when i got him into his box, from which he had slipped, i was off as fast as i could run.” “who’s teddy?” asked holmes. the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of hutch in the corner. in an instant out there slipped a beautiful reddish-brown creature, thin and lithe, with the legs of a stoat, a long, thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes that ever i saw in an animal’s head. “it’s a mongoose,” i cried. “well, some call them that, and some call them ichneumon,” said the man. “snake-catcher is what i call them, and teddy is amazing quick on cobras. i have one here without the fangs, and teddy catches it every night to please the folk in the canteen. “any other point, sir?” “well, we may have to apply to you again if mrs. barclay should prove to be in serious trouble.” “in that case, of course, i’d come forward.” “but if not, there is no object in raking up this scandal against a dead man, foully as he has acted. you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed. ah, there goes major murphy on the other side of the street. good-by, wood. i want to learn if anything has happened since yesterday.” we were in time to overtake the major before he reached the corner. “ah, holmes,” he said: “i suppose you have heard that all this fuss has come to nothing?” “what then?” “the inquest is just over. the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy. you see it was quite a simple case after all.” “oh, remarkably superficial,” said holmes, smiling. “come, watson, i don’t think we shall be wanted in aldershot any more.” “there’s one thing,” said i, as we walked down to the station. “if the husband’s name was james, and the other was henry, what was this talk about david?” “that one word, my dear watson, should have told me the whole story had i been the ideal reasoner which you are so fond of depicting. it was evidently a term of reproach.” “of reproach?” “yes; david strayed a little occasionally, you know, and on one occasion in the same direction as sergeant james barclay. you remember the small affair of uriah and bathsheba? my biblical knowledge is a trifle rusty, i fear, but you will find the story in the first or second of samuel.” ix. the resident patient in glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of memoirs with which i have endeavoured to illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my friend mr. sherlock holmes, i have been struck by the difficulty which i have experienced in picking out examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. for in those cases in which holmes has performed some _tour-de-force_ of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that i could not feel justified in laying them before the public. on the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than i, as his biographer, could wish. the small matter which i have chronicled under the heading of “a study in scarlet,” and that other later one connected with the loss of the _gloria scott_, may serve as examples of this scylla and charybdis which are forever threatening the historian. it may be that in the business of which i am now about to write the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances is so remarkable that i cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series. i cannot be sure of the exact date, for some of my memoranda upon the matter have been mislaid, but it must have been towards the end of the first year during which holmes and i shared chambers in baker street. it was boisterous october weather, and we had both remained indoors all day, i because i feared with my shaken health to face the keen autumn wind, while he was deep in some of those abstruse chemical investigations which absorbed him utterly as long as he was engaged upon them. towards evening, however, the breaking of a test-tube brought his research to a premature ending, and he sprang up from his chair with an exclamation of impatience and a clouded brow. “a day’s work ruined, watson,” said he, striding across to the window. “ha! the stars are out and the wind has fallen. what do you say to a ramble through london?” i was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced. for three hours we strolled about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand. holmes had shaken off his temporary ill-humour, and his characteristic talk, with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled. it was ten o’clock before we reached baker street again. a brougham was waiting at our door. “hum! a doctor’s—general practitioner, i perceive,” said holmes. “not been long in practice, but has had a good deal to do. come to consult us, i fancy! lucky we came back!” i was sufficiently conversant with holmes’s methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamplight inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. the light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. with some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, i followed holmes into our sanctum. a pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered. his age may not have been more than three or four and thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy hue told of a life which has sapped his strength and robbed him of his youth. his manner was nervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentleman, and the thin white hand which he laid on the mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather than of a surgeon. his dress was quiet and sombre—a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of colour about his necktie. “good-evening, doctor,” said holmes, cheerily. “i am glad to see that you have only been waiting a very few minutes.” “you spoke to my coachman, then?” “no, it was the candle on the side-table that told me. pray resume your seat and let me know how i can serve you.” “my name is doctor percy trevelyan,” said our visitor, “and i live at 403, brook street.” “are you not the author of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?” i asked. his pale cheeks flushed with pleasure at hearing that his work was known to me. “i so seldom hear of the work that i thought it was quite dead,” said he. “my publishers gave me a most discouraging account of its sale. you are yourself, i presume, a medical man?” “a retired army surgeon.” “my own hobby has always been nervous disease. i should wish to make it an absolute specialty, but, of course, a man must take what he can get at first. this, however, is beside the question, mr. sherlock holmes, and i quite appreciate how valuable your time is. the fact is that a very singular train of events has occurred recently at my house in brook street, and to-night they came to such a head that i felt it was quite impossible for me to wait another hour before asking for your advice and assistance.” sherlock holmes sat down and lit his pipe. “you are very welcome to both,” said he. “pray let me have a detailed account of what the circumstances are which have disturbed you.” “one or two of them are so trivial,” said dr. trevelyan, “that really i am almost ashamed to mention them. but the matter is so inexplicable, and the recent turn which it has taken is so elaborate, that i shall lay it all before you, and you shall judge what is essential and what is not. “i am compelled, to begin with, to say something of my own college career. i am a london university man, you know, and i am sure that you will not think that i am unduly singing my own praises if i say that my student career was considered by my professors to be a very promising one. after i had graduated i continued to devote myself to research, occupying a minor position in king’s college hospital, and i was fortunate enough to excite considerable interest by my research into the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win the bruce pinkerton prize and medal by the monograph on nervous lesions to which your friend has just alluded. i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me. “but the one great stumbling-block lay in my want of capital. as you will readily understand, a specialist who aims high is compelled to start in one of a dozen streets in the cavendish square quarter, all of which entail enormous rents and furnishing expenses. besides this preliminary outlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse. to do this was quite beyond my power, and i could only hope that by economy i might in ten years’ time save enough to enable me to put up my plate. suddenly, however, an unexpected incident opened up quite a new prospect to me. “this was a visit from a gentleman of the name of blessington, who was a complete stranger to me. he came up to my room one morning, and plunged into business in an instant. “‘you are the same percy trevelyan who has had so distinguished a career and won a great prize lately?’ said he. “i bowed. “‘answer me frankly,’ he continued, ‘for you will find it to your interest to do so. you have all the cleverness which makes a successful man. have you the tact?’ “i could not help smiling at the abruptness of the question. “‘i trust that i have my share,’ i said. “‘any bad habits? not drawn towards drink, eh?’ “‘really, sir!’ i cried. “‘quite right! that’s all right! but i was bound to ask. with all these qualities, why are you not in practice?’ “i shrugged my shoulders. “‘come, come!’ said he, in his bustling way. ‘it’s the old story. more in your brains than in your pocket, eh? what would you say if i were to start you in brook street?’ “i stared at him in astonishment. “‘oh, it’s for my sake, not for yours,’ he cried. ‘i’ll be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you it will suit me very well. i have a few thousands to invest, d’ye see, and i think i’ll sink them in you.’ “‘but why?’ i gasped. “‘well, it’s just like any other speculation, and safer than most.’ “‘what am i to do, then?’ “‘i’ll tell you. i’ll take the house, furnish it, pay the maids, and run the whole place. all you have to do is just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room. i’ll let you have pocket-money and everything. then you hand over to me three quarters of what you earn, and you keep the other quarter for yourself.’ “this was the strange proposal, mr. holmes, with which the man blessington approached me. i won’t weary you with the account of how we bargained and negotiated. it ended in my moving into the house next lady day, and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested. he came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient. his heart was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. he turned the two best rooms of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself. he was a man of singular habits, shunning company and very seldom going out. his life was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity itself. every evening, at the same hour, he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put down five and three-pence for every guinea that i had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong-box in his own room. “i may say with confidence that he never had occasion to regret his speculation. from the first it was a success. a few good cases and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front, and during the last few years i have made him a rich man. “so much, mr. holmes, for my past history and my relations with mr. blessington. it only remains for me now to tell you what has occurred to bring me here to-night. “some weeks ago mr. blessington came down to me in, as it seemed to me, a state of considerable agitation. he spoke of some burglary which, he said, had been committed in the west end, and he appeared, i remember, to be quite unnecessarily excited about it, declaring that a day should not pass before we should add stronger bolts to our windows and doors. for a week he continued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short walk which had usually been the prelude to his dinner. from his manner it struck me that he was in mortal dread of something or somebody, but when i questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that i was compelled to drop the subject. gradually, as time passed, his fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now lies. “what happened was this. two days ago i received the letter which i now read to you. neither address nor date is attached to it. “‘a russian nobleman who is now resident in england,’ it runs, ‘would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of dr. percy trevelyan. he has been for some years a victim to cataleptic attacks, on which, as is well known, dr. trevelyan is an authority. he proposes to call at about quarter past six to-morrow evening, if dr. trevelyan will make it convenient to be at home.’ “this letter interested me deeply, because the chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy is the rareness of the disease. you may believe, then, that i was in my consulting-room when, at the appointed hour, the page showed in the patient. “he was an elderly man, thin, demure, and commonplace—by no means the conception one forms of a russian nobleman. i was much more struck by the appearance of his companion. this was a tall young man, surprisingly handsome, with a dark, fierce face, and the limbs and chest of a hercules. he had his hand under the other’s arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance. “‘you will excuse my coming in, doctor,’ said he to me, speaking english with a slight lisp. ‘this is my father, and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming importance to me.’ “i was touched by this filial anxiety. ‘you would, perhaps, care to remain during the consultation?’ said i. “‘not for the world,’ he cried with a gesture of horror. ‘it is more painful to me than i can express. if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am convinced that i should never survive it. my own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive one. with your permission, i will remain in the waiting-room while you go into my father’s case.’ “to this, of course, i assented, and the young man withdrew. the patient and i then plunged into a discussion of his case, of which i took exhaustive notes. he was not remarkable for intelligence, and his answers were frequently obscure, which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language. suddenly, however, as i sat writing, he ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries, and on my turning towards him i was shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair, staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face. he was again in the grip of his mysterious malady. “my first feeling, as i have just said, was one of pity and horror. my second, i fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction. i made notes of my patient’s pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions, which harmonised with my former experiences. i had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. the bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in his chair, i ran down to get it. there was some little delay in finding it—five minutes, let us say—and then i returned. imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone. “of course, my first act was to run into the waiting-room. the son had gone also. the hall door had been closed, but not shut. my page who admits patients is a new boy and by no means quick. he waits downstairs, and runs up to show patients out when i ring the consulting-room bell. he had heard nothing, and the affair remained a complete mystery. mr. blessington came in from his walk shortly afterwards, but i did not say anything to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth, i have got in the way of late of holding as little communication with him as possible. “well, i never thought that i should see anything more of the russian and his son, so you can imagine my amazement when, at the very same hour this evening, they both came marching into my consulting-room, just as they had done before. “‘i feel that i owe you a great many apologies for my abrupt departure yesterday, doctor,’ said my patient. “‘i confess that i was very much surprised at it,’ said i. “‘well, the fact is,’ he remarked, ‘that when i recover from these attacks my mind is always very clouded as to all that has gone before. i woke up in a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made my way out into the street in a sort of dazed way when you were absent.’ “‘and i,’ said the son, ‘seeing my father pass the door of the waiting-room, naturally thought that the consultation had come to an end. it was not until we had reached home that i began to realize the true state of affairs.’ “‘well,’ said i, laughing, ‘there is no harm done except that you puzzled me terribly; so if you, sir, would kindly step into the waiting-room i shall be happy to continue our consultation which was brought to so abrupt an ending.’ “‘for half an hour or so i discussed that old gentleman’s symptoms with him, and then, having prescribed for him, i saw him go off upon the arm of his son. “i have told you that mr. blessington generally chose this hour of the day for his exercise. he came in shortly afterwards and passed upstairs. an instant later i heard him running down, and he burst into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic. “‘who has been in my room?’ he cried. “‘no one,’ said i. “‘it’s a lie! he yelled. ‘come up and look!’ “i passed over the grossness of his language, as he seemed half out of his mind with fear. when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several footprints upon the light carpet. “‘d’you mean to say those are mine?’ he cried. “they were certainly very much larger than any which he could have made, and were evidently quite fresh. it rained hard this afternoon, as you know, and my patients were the only people who called. it must have been the case, then, that the man in the waiting-room had, for some unknown reason, while i was busy with the other, ascended to the room of my resident patient. nothing had been touched or taken, but there were the footprints to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact. “mr. blessington seemed more excited over the matter than i should have thought possible, though of course it was enough to disturb anybody’s peace of mind. he actually sat crying in an armchair, and i could hardly get him to speak coherently. it was his suggestion that i should come round to you, and of course i at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very singular one, though he appears to completely overrate its importance. if you would only come back with me in my brougham, you would at least be able to soothe him, though i can hardly hope that you will be able to explain this remarkable occurrence.” sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused. his face was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled up more thickly from his pipe to emphasize each curious episode in the doctor’s tale. as our visitor concluded, holmes sprang up without a word, handed me my hat, picked his own from the table, and followed dr. trevelyan to the door. within a quarter of an hour we had been dropped at the door of the physician’s residence in brook street, one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one associates with a west-end practice. a small page admitted us, and we began at once to ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair. but a singular interruption brought us to a standstill. the light at the top was suddenly whisked out, and from the darkness came a reedy, quivering voice. “i have a pistol,” it cried. “i give you my word that i’ll fire if you come any nearer.” “this really grows outrageous, mr. blessington,” cried dr. trevelyan. “oh, then it is you, doctor,” said the voice, with a great heave of relief. “but those other gentlemen, are they what they pretend to be?” we were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness. “yes, yes, it’s all right,” said the voice at last. “you can come up, and i am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you.” he relit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw before us a singular-looking man, whose appearance, as well as his voice, testified to his jangled nerves. he was very fat, but had apparently at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of a blood-hound. he was of a sickly colour, and his thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. in his hand he held a pistol, but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced. “good-evening, mr. holmes,” said he. “i am sure i am very much obliged to you for coming round. no one ever needed your advice more than i do. i suppose that dr. trevelyan has told you of this most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.” “quite so,” said holmes. “who are these two men mr. blessington, and why do they wish to molest you?” “well, well,” said the resident patient, in a nervous fashion, “of course it is hard to say that. you can hardly expect me to answer that, mr. holmes.” “do you mean that you don’t know?” “come in here, if you please. just have the kindness to step in here.” he led the way into his bedroom, which was large and comfortably furnished. “you see that,” said he, pointing to a big black box at the end of his bed. “i have never been a very rich man, mr. holmes—never made but one investment in my life, as dr. trevelyan would tell you. but i don’t believe in bankers. i would never trust a banker, mr. holmes. between ourselves, what little i have is in that box, so you can understand what it means to me when unknown people force themselves into my rooms.” holmes looked at blessington in his questioning way and shook his head. “i cannot possibly advise you if you try to deceive me,” said he. “but i have told you everything.” holmes turned on his heel with a gesture of disgust. “good-night, dr. trevelyan,” said he. “and no advice for me?” cried blessington, in a breaking voice. “my advice to you, sir, is to speak the truth.” a minute later we were in the street and walking for home. we had crossed oxford street and were half way down harley street before i could get a word from my companion. “sorry to bring you out on such a fool’s errand, watson,” he said at last. “it is an interesting case, too, at the bottom of it.” “i can make little of it,” i confessed. “well, it is quite evident that there are two men—more, perhaps, but at least two—who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow blessington. i have no doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to blessington’s room, while his confederate, by an ingenious device, kept the doctor from interfering.” “and the catalepsy?” “a fraudulent imitation, watson, though i should hardly dare to hint as much to our specialist. it is a very easy complaint to imitate. i have done it myself.” “and then?” “by the purest chance blessington was out on each occasion. their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room. it just happened, however, that this hour coincided with blessington’s constitutional, which seems to show that they were not very well acquainted with his daily routine. of course, if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it. besides, i can read in a man’s eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for. it is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it. i hold it, therefore, to be certain that he does know who these men are, and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it. it is just possible that to-morrow may find him in a more communicative mood.” “is there not one alternative,” i suggested, “grotesquely improbable, no doubt, but still just conceivable? might the whole story of the cataleptic russian and his son be a concoction of dr. trevelyan’s, who has, for his own purposes, been in blessington’s rooms?” i saw in the gaslight that holmes wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine. “my dear fellow,” said he, “it was one of the first solutions which occurred to me, but i was soon able to corroborate the doctor’s tale. this young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room. when i tell you that his shoes were square-toed instead of being pointed like blessington’s, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor’s, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality. but we may sleep on it now, for i shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from brook street in the morning.” sherlock holmes’s prophecy was soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic fashion. at half-past seven next morning, in the first glimmer of daylight, i found him standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown. “there’s a brougham waiting for us, watson,” said he. “what’s the matter, then?” “the brook street business.” “any fresh news?” “tragic, but ambiguous,” said he, pulling up the blind. “look at this—a sheet from a note-book, with ‘for god’s sake come at once—p.t.,’ scrawled upon it in pencil. our friend, the doctor, was hard put to it when he wrote this. come along, my dear fellow, for it’s an urgent call.” in a quarter of an hour or so we were back at the physician’s house. he came running out to meet us with a face of horror. “oh, such a business!” he cried, with his hands to his temples. “what then?” “blessington has committed suicide!” holmes whistled. “yes, he hanged himself during the night.” we had entered, and the doctor had preceded us into what was evidently his waiting-room. “i really hardly know what i am doing,” he cried. “the police are already upstairs. it has shaken me most dreadfully.” “when did you find it out?” “he has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning. when the maid entered, about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the middle of the room. he had tied his cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday.” holmes stood for a moment in deep thought. “with your permission,” said he at last, “i should like to go upstairs and look into the matter.” we both ascended, followed by the doctor. it was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom door. i have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man blessington conveyed. as he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance. the neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken’s, making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural by the contrast. he was clad only in his long night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded starkly from beneath it. beside him stood a smart-looking police-inspector, who was taking notes in a pocket-book. “ah, mr. holmes,” said he, heartily, as my friend entered, “i am delighted to see you.” “good-morning, lanner,” answered holmes; “you won’t think me an intruder, i am sure. have you heard of the events which led up to this affair?” “yes, i heard something of them.” “have you formed any opinion?” “as far as i can see, the man has been driven out of his senses by fright. the bed has been well slept in, you see. there’s his impression deep enough. it’s about five in the morning, you know, that suicides are most common. that would be about his time for hanging himself. it seems to have been a very deliberate affair.” “i should say that he has been dead about three hours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,” said i. “noticed anything peculiar about the room?” asked holmes. “found a screw-driver and some screws on the wash-hand stand. seems to have smoked heavily during the night, too. here are four cigar-ends that i picked out of the fireplace.” “hum!” said holmes, “have you got his cigar-holder?” “no, i have seen none.” “his cigar-case, then?” “yes, it was in his coat-pocket.” holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which it contained. “oh, this is a havana, and these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by the dutch from their east indian colonies. they are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are thinner for their length than any other brand.” he picked up the four ends and examined them with his pocket-lens. “two of these have been smoked from a holder and two without,” said he. “two have been cut by a not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent teeth. this is no suicide, mr. lanner. it is a very deeply planned and cold-blooded murder.” “impossible!” cried the inspector. “and why?” “why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?” “that is what we have to find out.” “how could they get in?” “through the front door.” “it was barred in the morning.” “then it was barred after them.” “how do you know?” “i saw their traces. excuse me a moment, and i may be able to give you some further information about it.” he went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical way. then he took out the key, which was on the inside, and inspected that also. the bed, the carpet, the chairs, the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were each in turn examined, until at last he professed himself satisfied, and with my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object and laid it reverently under a sheet. “how about this rope?” he asked. “it is cut off this,” said dr. trevelyan, drawing a large coil from under the bed. “he was morbidly nervous of fire, and always kept this beside him, so that he might escape by the window in case the stairs were burning.” “that must have saved them trouble,” said holmes, thoughtfully. “yes, the actual facts are very plain, and i shall be surprised if by the afternoon i cannot give you the reasons for them as well. i will take this photograph of blessington, which i see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help me in my inquiries.” “but you have told us nothing!” cried the doctor. “oh, there can be no doubt as to the sequence of events,” said holmes. “there were three of them in it: the young man, the old man, and a third, to whose identity i have no clue. the first two, i need hardly remark, are the same who masqueraded as the russian count and his son, so we can give a very full description of them. they were admitted by a confederate inside the house. if i might offer you a word of advice, inspector, it would be to arrest the page, who, as i understand, has only recently come into your service, doctor.” “the young imp cannot be found,” said dr. trevelyan; “the maid and the cook have just been searching for him.” holmes shrugged his shoulders. “he has played a not unimportant part in this drama,” said he. “the three men having ascended the stairs, which they did on tiptoe, the elder man first, the younger man second, and the unknown man in the rear—” “my dear holmes!” i ejaculated. “oh, there could be no question as to the superimposing of the footmarks. i had the advantage of learning which was which last night. they ascended, then, to mr. blessington’s room, the door of which they found to be locked. with the help of a wire, however, they forced round the key. even without the lens you will perceive, by the scratches on this ward, where the pressure was applied. “on entering the room their first proceeding must have been to gag mr. blessington. he may have been asleep, or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. these walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his shriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard. “having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of some sort was held. probably it was something in the nature of a judicial proceeding. it must have lasted for some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoked. the older man sat in that wicker chair; it was he who used the cigar-holder. the younger man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. the third fellow paced up and down. blessington, i think, sat upright in the bed, but of that i cannot be absolutely certain. “well, it ended by their taking blessington and hanging him. the matter was so prearranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows. that screw-driver and those screws were, as i conceive, for fixing it up. seeing the hook, however they naturally saved themselves the trouble. having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate.” we had all listened with the deepest interest to this sketch of the night’s doings, which holmes had deduced from signs so subtle and minute that, even when he had pointed them out to us, we could scarcely follow him in his reasoning. the inspector hurried away on the instant to make inquiries about the page, while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast. “i’ll be back by three,” said he, when we had finished our meal. “both the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that hour, and i hope by that time to have cleared up any little obscurity which the case may still present.” our visitors arrived at the appointed time, but it was a quarter to four before my friend put in an appearance. from his expression as he entered, however, i could see that all had gone well with him. “any news, inspector?” “we have got the boy, sir.” “excellent, and i have got the men.” “you have got them!” we cried, all three. “well, at least i have got their identity. this so-called blessington is, as i expected, well known at headquarters, and so are his assailants. their names are biddle, hayward, and moffat.” “the worthingdon bank gang,” cried the inspector. “precisely,” said holmes. “then blessington must have been sutton.” “exactly,” said holmes. “why, that makes it as clear as crystal,” said the inspector. but trevelyan and i looked at each other in bewilderment. “you must surely remember the great worthingdon bank business,” said holmes. “five men were in it—these four and a fifth called cartwright. tobin, the caretaker, was murdered, and the thieves got away with seven thousand pounds. this was in 1875. they were all five arrested, but the evidence against them was by no means conclusive. this blessington or sutton, who was the worst of the gang, turned informer. on his evidence cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece. when they got out the other day, which was some years before their full term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their comrade upon him. twice they tried to get at him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. is there anything further which i can explain, dr. trevelyan?” “i think you have made it all remarkably clear,” said the doctor. “no doubt the day on which he was perturbed was the day when he had seen of their release in the newspapers.” “quite so. his talk about a burglary was the merest blind.” “but why could he not tell you this?” “well, my dear sir, knowing the vindictive character of his old associates, he was trying to hide his own identity from everybody as long as he could. his secret was a shameful one, and he could not bring himself to divulge it. however, wretch as he was, he was still living under the shield of british law, and i have no doubt, inspector, that you will see that, though that shield may fail to guard, the sword of justice is still there to avenge.” such were the singular circumstances in connection with the resident patient and the brook street doctor. from that night nothing has been seen of the three murderers by the police, and it is surmised at scotland yard that they were among the passengers of the ill-fated steamer _norah creina_, which was lost some years ago with all hands upon the portuguese coast, some leagues to the north of oporto. the proceedings against the page broke down for want of evidence, and the brook street mystery, as it was called, has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print. x. the greek interpreter during my long and intimate acquaintance with mr. sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his own early life. this reticence upon his part had increased the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until sometimes i found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain without a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in intelligence. his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his unemotional character, but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people. i had come to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he began to talk to me about his brother. it was after tea on a summer evening, and the conversation, which had roamed in a desultory, spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came round at last to the question of atavism and hereditary aptitudes. the point under discussion was, how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his ancestry and how far to his own early training. “in your own case,” said i, “from all that you have told me, it seems obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar facility for deduction are due to your own systematic training.” “to some extent,” he answered, thoughtfully. “my ancestors were country squires, who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class. but, none the less, my turn that way is in my veins, and may have come with my grandmother, who was the sister of vernet, the french artist. art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.” “but how do you know that it is hereditary?” “because my brother mycroft possesses it in a larger degree than i do.” this was news to me indeed. if there were another man with such singular powers in england, how was it that neither police nor public had heard of him? i put the question, with a hint that it was my companion’s modesty which made him acknowledge his brother as his superior. holmes laughed at my suggestion. “my dear watson,” said he, “i cannot agree with those who rank modesty among the virtues. to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are, and to underestimate one’s self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one’s own powers. when i say, therefore, that mycroft has better powers of observation than i, you may take it that i am speaking the exact and literal truth.” “is he your junior?” “seven years my senior.” “how comes it that he is unknown?” “oh, he is very well known in his own circle.” “where, then?” “well, in the diogenes club, for example.” i had never heard of the institution, and my face must have proclaimed as much, for sherlock holmes pulled out his watch. “the diogenes club is the queerest club in london, and mycroft one of the queerest men. he’s always there from quarter to five to twenty to eight. it’s six now, so if you care for a stroll this beautiful evening i shall be very happy to introduce you to two curiosities.” five minutes later we were in the street, walking towards regent’s circus. “you wonder,” said my companion, “why it is that mycroft does not use his powers for detective work. he is incapable of it.” “but i thought you said—” “i said that he was my superior in observation and deduction. if the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an armchair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived. but he has no ambition and no energy. he will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. again and again i have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. and yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury.” “it is not his profession, then?” “by no means. what is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante. he has an extraordinary faculty for figures, and audits the books in some of the government departments. mycroft lodges in pall mall, and he walks round the corner into whitehall every morning and back every evening. from year’s end to year’s end he takes no other exercise, and is seen nowhere else, except only in the diogenes club, which is just opposite his rooms.” “i cannot recall the name.” “very likely not. there are many men in london, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. it is for the convenience of these that the diogenes club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubable men in town. no member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. save in the stranger’s room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. my brother was one of the founders, and i have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.” we had reached pall mall as we talked, and were walking down it from the st. james’s end. sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton, and, cautioning me not to speak, he led the way into the hall. through the glass paneling i caught a glimpse of a large and luxurious room, in which a considerable number of men were sitting about and reading papers, each in his own little nook. holmes showed me into a small chamber which looked out into pall mall, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion whom i knew could only be his brother. mycroft holmes was a much larger and stouter man than sherlock. his body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother. his eyes, which were of a peculiarly light, watery grey, seemed to always retain that far-away, introspective look which i had only observed in sherlock’s when he was exerting his full powers. “i am glad to meet you, sir,” said he, putting out a broad, fat hand like the flipper of a seal. “i hear of sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler. by the way, sherlock, i expected to see you round last week, to consult me over that manor house case. i thought you might be a little out of your depth.” “no, i solved it,” said my friend, smiling. “it was adams, of course.” “yes, it was adams.” “i was sure of it from the first.” the two sat down together in the bow-window of the club. “to any one who wishes to study mankind this is the spot,” said mycroft. “look at the magnificent types! look at these two men who are coming towards us, for example.” “the billiard-marker and the other?” “precisely. what do you make of the other?” the two men had stopped opposite the window. some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them. the other was a very small, dark fellow, with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm. “an old soldier, i perceive,” said sherlock. “and very recently discharged,” remarked the brother. “served in india, i see.” “and a non-commissioned officer.” “royal artillery, i fancy,” said sherlock. “and a widower.” “but with a child.” “children, my dear boy, children.” “come,” said i, laughing, “this is a little too much.” “surely,” answered holmes, “it is not hard to say that a man with that bearing, expression of authority, and sunbaked skin, is a soldier, is more than a private, and is not long from india.” “that he has not left the service long is shown by his still wearing his ammunition boots, as they are called,” observed mycroft. “he had not the cavalry stride, yet he wore his hat on one side, as is shown by the lighter skin of that side of his brow. his weight is against his being a sapper. he is in the artillery.” “then, of course, his complete mourning shows that he has lost some one very dear. the fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as though it were his wife. he has been buying things for children, you perceive. there is a rattle, which shows that one of them is very young. the wife probably died in childbed. the fact that he has a picture-book under his arm shows that there is another child to be thought of.” i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener faculties that he did himself. he glanced across at me and smiled. mycroft took snuff from a tortoise-shell box, and brushed away the wandering grains from his coat front with a large, red silk handkerchief. “by the way, sherlock,” said he, “i have had something quite after your own heart—a most singular problem—submitted to my judgment. i really had not the energy to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion, but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation. if you would care to hear the facts—” “my dear mycroft, i should be delighted.” the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his pocket-book, and, ringing the bell, he handed it to the waiter. “i have asked mr. melas to step across,” said he. “he lodges on the floor above me, and i have some slight acquaintance with him, which led him to come to me in his perplexity. mr. melas is a greek by extraction, as i understand, and he is a remarkable linguist. he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels. i think i will leave him to tell his very remarkable experience in his own fashion.” a few minutes later we were joined by a short, stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his southern origin, though his speech was that of an educated englishman. he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was anxious to hear his story. “i do not believe that the police credit me—on my word, i do not,” said he in a wailing voice. “just because they have never heard of it before, they think that such a thing cannot be. but i know that i shall never be easy in my mind until i know what has become of my poor man with the sticking-plaster upon his face.” “i am all attention,” said sherlock holmes. “this is wednesday evening,” said mr. melas. “well then, it was monday night—only two days ago, you understand—that all this happened. i am an interpreter, as perhaps my neighbour there has told you. i interpret all languages—or nearly all—but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name, it is with that particular tongue that i am principally associated. for many years i have been the chief greek interpreter in london, and my name is very well known in the hotels. “it happens not unfrequently that i am sent for at strange hours by foreigners who get into difficulties, or by travelers who arrive late and wish my services. i was not surprised, therefore, on monday night when a mr. latimer, a very fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a cab which was waiting at the door. a greek friend had come to see him upon business, he said, and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue, the services of an interpreter were indispensable. he gave me to understand that his house was some little distance off, in kensington, and he seemed to be in a great hurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we had descended to the street. “i say into the cab, but i soon became doubtful as to whether it was not a carriage in which i found myself. it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london, and the fittings, though frayed, were of rich quality. mr. latimer seated himself opposite to me and we started off through charing cross and up the shaftesbury avenue. we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington, when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my companion. “he began by drawing a most formidable-looking bludgeon loaded with lead from his pocket, and switching it backward and forward several times, as if to test its weight and strength. then he placed it without a word upon the seat beside him. having done this, he drew up the windows on each side, and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing through them. “‘i am sorry to cut off your view, mr. melas,’ said he. ‘the fact is that i have no intention that you should see what the place is to which we are driving. it might possibly be inconvenient to me if you could find your way there again.’ “as you can imagine, i was utterly taken aback by such an address. my companion was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart from the weapon, i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him. “‘this is very extraordinary conduct, mr. latimer,’ i stammered. ‘you must be aware that what you are doing is quite illegal.’ “‘it is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,’ said he, ‘but we’ll make it up to you. i must warn you, however, mr. melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is against my interests, you will find it a very serious thing. i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are, and that, whether you are in this carriage or in my house, you are equally in my power.’ “his words were quiet, but he had a rasping way of saying them which was very menacing. i sat in silence wondering what on earth could be his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary fashion. whatever it might be, it was perfectly clear that there was no possible use in my resisting, and that i could only wait to see what might befall. “for nearly two hours we drove without my having the least clue as to where we were going. sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course suggested asphalt; but, save by this variation in sound, there was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to form a guess as to where we were. the paper over each window was impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front. it was a quarter-past seven when we left pall mall, and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. my companion let down the window, and i caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. as i was hurried from the carriage it swung open, and i found myself inside the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as i entered. whether these were private grounds, however, or _bonâ-fide_ country was more than i could possibly venture to say. “there was a coloured gas-lamp inside which was turned so low that i could see little save that the hall was of some size and hung with pictures. in the dim light i could make out that the person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking, middle-aged man with rounded shoulders. as he turned towards us the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses. “‘is this mr. melas, harold?’ said he. “‘yes.’ “‘well done, well done! no ill-will, mr. melas, i hope, but we could not get on without you. if you deal fair with us you’ll not regret it, but if you try any tricks, god help you!’ he spoke in a nervous, jerky fashion, and with little giggling laughs in between, but somehow he impressed me with fear more than the other. “‘what do you want with me?’ i asked. “‘only to ask a few questions of a greek gentleman who is visiting us, and to let us have the answers. but say no more than you are told to say, or’—here came the nervous giggle again—‘you had better never have been born.’ “as he spoke he opened a door and showed the way into a room which appeared to be very richly furnished, but again the only light was afforded by a single lamp half-turned down. the chamber was certainly large, and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i stepped across it told me of its richness. i caught glimpses of velvet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and what seemed to be a suit of japanese armour at one side of it. there was a chair just under the lamp, and the elderly man motioned that i should sit in it. the younger had left us, but he suddenly returned through another door, leading with him a gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us. as he came into the circle of dim light which enables me to see him more clearly i was thrilled with horror at his appearance. he was deadly pale and terribly emaciated, with the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength. but what shocked me more than any signs of physical weakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-crossed with sticking-plaster, and that one large pad of it was fastened over his mouth. “‘have you the slate, harold?’ cried the older man, as this strange being fell rather than sat down into a chair. ‘are his hands loose? now, then, give him the pencil. you are to ask the questions, mr. melas, and he will write the answers. ask him first of all whether he is prepared to sign the papers?’ “the man’s eyes flashed fire. “‘never!’ he wrote in greek upon the slate. “‘on no condition?’ i asked, at the bidding of our tyrant. “‘only if i see her married in my presence by a greek priest whom i know.’ “the man giggled in his venomous way. “‘you know what awaits you, then?’ “‘i care nothing for myself.’ “these are samples of the questions and answers which made up our strange half-spoken, half-written conversation. again and again i had to ask him whether he would give in and sign the documents. again and again i had the same indignant reply. but soon a happy thought came to me. i took to adding on little sentences of my own to each question, innocent ones at first, to test whether either of our companions knew anything of the matter, and then, as i found that they showed no signs i played a more dangerous game. our conversation ran something like this: “‘you can do no good by this obstinacy. _who are you?_’ “‘i care not. _i am a stranger in london._’ “‘your fate will be upon your own head. _how long have you been here?_’ “‘let it be so. _three weeks._’ “‘the property can never be yours. _what ails you?_’ “‘it shall not go to villains. _they are starving me._’ “‘you shall go free if you sign. _what house is this?_’ “‘i will never sign. _i do not know._’ “‘you are not doing her any service. _what is your name?_’ “‘let me hear her say so. _kratides._’ “‘you shall see her if you sign. _where are you from?_’ “‘then i shall never see her. _athens._’ “another five minutes, mr. holmes, and i should have wormed out the whole story under their very noses. my very next question might have cleared the matter up, but at that instant the door opened and a woman stepped into the room. i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and clad in some sort of loose white gown. “‘harold,’ said she, speaking english with a broken accent. ‘i could not stay away longer. it is so lonely up there with only—oh, my god, it is paul!’ “these last words were in greek, and at the same instant the man with a convulsive effort tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming out ‘sophy! sophy!’ rushed into the woman’s arms. their embrace was but for an instant, however, for the younger man seized the woman and pushed her out of the room, while the elder easily overpowered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away through the other door. for a moment i was left alone in the room, and i sprang to my feet with some vague idea that i might in some way get a clue to what this house was in which i found myself. fortunately, however, i took no steps, for looking up i saw that the older man was standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed upon me. “‘that will do, mr. melas,’ said he. ‘you perceive that we have taken you into our confidence over some very private business. we should not have troubled you, only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the east. it was quite necessary for us to find some one to take his place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.’ “i bowed. “‘there are five sovereigns here,’ said he, walking up to me, ‘which will, i hope, be a sufficient fee. but remember,’ he added, tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling, ‘if you speak to a human soul about this—one human soul, mind—well, may god have mercy upon your soul!” “i cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which this insignificant-looking man inspired me. i could see him better now as the lamp-light shone upon him. his features were peaky and sallow, and his little pointed beard was thready and ill-nourished. he pushed his face forward as he spoke and his lips and eyelids were continually twitching like a man with st. vitus’s dance. i could not help thinking that his strange, catchy little laugh was also a symptom of some nervous malady. the terror of his face lay in his eyes, however, steel grey, and glistening coldly with a malignant, inexorable cruelty in their depths. “‘we shall know if you speak of this,’ said he. ‘we have our own means of information. now you will find the carriage waiting, and my friend will see you on your way.’ “i was hurried through the hall and into the vehicle, again obtaining that momentary glimpse of trees and a garden. mr. latimer followed closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a word. in silence we again drove for an interminable distance with the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled up. “‘you will get down here, mr. melas,’ said my companion. ‘i am sorry to leave you so far from your house, but there is no alternative. any attempt upon your part to follow the carriage can only end in injury to yourself.’ “he opened the door as he spoke, and i had hardly time to spring out when the coachman lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away. i looked around me in astonishment. i was on some sort of a heathy common mottled over with dark clumps of furze-bushes. far away stretched a line of houses, with a light here and there in the upper windows. on the other side i saw the red signal-lamps of a railway. “the carriage which had brought me was already out of sight. i stood gazing round and wondering where on earth i might be, when i saw some one coming towards me in the darkness. as he came up to me i made out that he was a railway porter. “‘can you tell me what place this is?’ i asked. “‘wandsworth common,’ said he. “‘can i get a train into town?’ “‘if you walk on a mile or so to clapham junction,’ said he, ‘you’ll just be in time for the last to victoria.’ “so that was the end of my adventure, mr. holmes. i do not know where i was, nor whom i spoke with, nor anything save what i have told you. but i know that there is foul play going on, and i want to help that unhappy man if i can. i told the whole story to mr. mycroft holmes next morning, and subsequently to the police.” we all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. then sherlock looked across at his brother. “any steps?” he asked. mycroft picked up the _daily news_, which was lying on the side-table. “‘anybody supplying any information to the whereabouts of a greek gentleman named paul kratides, from athens, who is unable to speak english, will be rewarded. a similar reward paid to any one giving information about a greek lady whose first name is sophy. x 2473.’ that was in all the dailies. no answer.” “how about the greek legation?” “i have inquired. they know nothing.” “a wire to the head of the athens police, then?” “sherlock has all the energy of the family,” said mycroft, turning to me. “well, you take the case up by all means, and let me know if you do any good.” “certainly,” answered my friend, rising from his chair. “i’ll let you know, and mr. melas also. in the meantime, mr. melas, i should certainly be on my guard, if i were you, for of course they must know through these advertisements that you have betrayed them.” as we walked home together, holmes stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several wires. “you see, watson,” he remarked, “our evening has been by no means wasted. some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this way through mycroft. the problem which we have just listened to, although it can admit of but one explanation, has still some distinguishing features.” “you have hopes of solving it?” “well, knowing as much as we do, it will be singular indeed if we fail to discover the rest. you must yourself have formed some theory which will explain the facts to which we have listened.” “in a vague way, yes.” “what was your idea, then?” “it seemed to me to be obvious that this greek girl had been carried off by the young englishman named harold latimer.” “carried off from where?” “athens, perhaps.” sherlock holmes shook his head. “this young man could not talk a word of greek. the lady could talk english fairly well. inference, that she had been in england some little time, but he had not been in greece.” “well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to england, and that this harold had persuaded her to fly with him.” “that is more probable.” “then the brother—for that, i fancy, must be the relationship—comes over from greece to interfere. he imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate. they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl’s fortune—of which he may be trustee—to them. this he refuses to do. in order to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this mr. melas, having used some other one before. the girl is not told of the arrival of her brother, and finds it out by the merest accident.” “excellent, watson!” cried holmes. “i really fancy that you are not far from the truth. you see that we hold all the cards, and we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part. if they give us time we must have them.” “but how can we find where this house lies?” “well, if our conjecture is correct and the girl’s name is or was sophy kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her. that must be our main hope, for the brother is, of course, a complete stranger. it is clear that some time has elapsed since this harold established these relations with the girl—some weeks, at any rate—since the brother in greece has had time to hear of it and come across. if they have been living in the same place during this time, it is probable that we shall have some answer to mycroft’s advertisement.” we had reached our house in baker street while we had been talking. holmes ascended the stair first, and as he opened the door of our room he gave a start of surprise. looking over his shoulder, i was equally astonished. his brother mycroft was sitting smoking in the armchair. “come in, sherlock! come in, sir,” said he blandly, smiling at our surprised faces. “you don’t expect such energy from me, do you, sherlock? but somehow this case attracts me.” “how did you get here?” “i passed you in a hansom.” “there has been some new development?” “i had an answer to my advertisement.” “ah!” “yes, it came within a few minutes of your leaving.” “and to what effect?” mycroft holmes took out a sheet of paper. “here it is,” said he, “written with a j pen on royal cream paper by a middle-aged man with a weak constitution. ‘sir,’ he says, ‘in answer to your advertisement of to-day’s date, i beg to inform you that i know the young lady in question very well. if you should care to call upon me i could give you some particulars as to her painful history. she is living at present at the myrtles, beckenham. yours faithfully, j. davenport.’ “he writes from lower brixton,” said mycroft holmes. “do you not think that we might drive to him now, sherlock, and learn these particulars?” “my dear mycroft, the brother’s life is more valuable than the sister’s story. i think we should call at scotland yard for inspector gregson, and go straight out to beckenham. we know that a man is being done to death, and every hour may be vital.” “better pick up mr. melas on our way,” i suggested. “we may need an interpreter.” “excellent,” said sherlock holmes. “send the boy for a four-wheeler, and we shall be off at once.” he opened the table-drawer as he spoke, and i noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket. “yes,” said he, in answer to my glance; “i should say from what we have heard, that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang.” it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall, at the rooms of mr. melas. a gentleman had just called for him, and he was gone. “can you tell me where?” asked mycroft holmes. “i don’t know, sir,” answered the woman who had opened the door; “i only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a carriage.” “did the gentleman give a name?” “no, sir.” “he wasn’t a tall, handsome, dark young man?” “oh, no, sir. he was a little gentleman, with glasses, thin in the face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing all the time that he was talking.” “come along!” cried sherlock holmes, abruptly. “this grows serious,” he observed, as we drove to scotland yard. “these men have got hold of melas again. he is a man of no physical courage, as they are well aware from their experience the other night. this villain was able to terrorise him the instant that he got into his presence. no doubt they want his professional services, but, having used him, they may be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery.” our hope was that, by taking train, we might get to beckenham as soon or sooner than the carriage. on reaching scotland yard, however, it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house. it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge, and half past before the four of us alighted on the beckenham platform. a drive of half a mile brought us to the myrtles—a large, dark house standing back from the road in its own grounds. here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up the drive together. “the windows are all dark,” remarked the inspector. “the house seems deserted.” “our birds are flown and the nest empty,” said holmes. “why do you say so?” “a carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the last hour.” the inspector laughed. “i saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?” “you may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. but the outward-bound ones were very much deeper—so much so that we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on the carriage.” “you get a trifle beyond me there,” said the inspector, shrugging his shoulder. “it will not be an easy door to force, but we will try if we cannot make some one hear us.” he hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but without any success. holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few minutes. “i have a window open,” said he. “it is a mercy that you are on the side of the force, and not against it, mr. holmes,” remarked the inspector, as he noted the clever way in which my friend had forced back the catch. “well, i think that under the circumstances we may enter without an invitation.” one after the other we made our way into a large apartment, which was evidently that in which mr. melas had found himself. the inspector had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see the two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them. on the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle, and the remains of a meal. “what is that?” asked holmes, suddenly. we all stood still and listened. a low moaning sound was coming from somewhere over our heads. holmes rushed to the door and out into the hall. the dismal noise came from upstairs. he dashed up, the inspector and i at his heels, while his brother mycroft followed as quickly as his great bulk would permit. three doors faced up upon the second floor, and it was from the central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. it was locked, but the key had been left on the outside. holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in an instant, with his hand to his throat. “it’s charcoal,” he cried. “give it time. it will clear.” peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre. it threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor, while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall. from the open door there reeked a horrible poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and coughing. holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he threw up the window and hurled the brazen tripod out into the garden. “we can enter in a minute,” he gasped, darting out again. “where is a candle? i doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere. hold the light at the door and we shall get them out, mycroft, now!” with a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out into the well-lit hall. both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. indeed, so distorted were their features that, save for his black beard and stout figure, we might have failed to recognise in one of them the greek interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours before at the diogenes club. his hands and feet were securely strapped together, and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow. the other, who was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage of emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque pattern over his face. he had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance showed me that for him at least our aid had come too late. mr. melas, however, still lived, and in less than an hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy i had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back from that dark valley in which all paths meet. it was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions. his visitor, on entering his rooms, had drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped him for the second time. indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. he had been taken swiftly to beckenham, and had acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than the first, in which the two englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he did not comply with their demands. finally, finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him. and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter, the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery. we were able to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in england. while there she had met a young man named harold latimer, who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him. her friends, shocked at the event, had contented themselves with informing her brother at athens, and had then washed their hands of the matter. the brother, on his arrival in england, had imprudently placed himself in the power of latimer and of his associate, whose name was wilson kemp—a man of the foulest antecedents. these two, finding that through his ignorance of the language he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeavoured by cruelty and starvation to make him sign away his own and his sister’s property. they had kept him in the house without the girl’s knowledge, and the plaster over the face had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse of him. her feminine perception, however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion of the interpreter’s visit, she had seen him for the first time. the poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators. finding that their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours’ notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance both upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them. months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from buda-pesth. it told how two englishmen who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end. they had each been stabbed, it seems, and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarreled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other. holmes, however, is, i fancy, of a different way of thinking, and holds to this day that, if one could find the grecian girl, one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her brother came to be avenged. xi. the naval treaty the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest, in which i had the privilege of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods. i find them recorded in my notes under the headings of “the adventure of the second stain,” “the adventure of the naval treaty,” and “the adventure of the tired captain.” the first of these, however, deals with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. no case, however, in which holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. i still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to monsieur dubuque of the paris police, and fritz von waldbaum, the well-known specialist of dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issues. the new century will have come, however, before the story can be safely told. meanwhile i pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique character. during my school-days i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he was two classes ahead of me. he was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at cambridge. he was, i remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all little boys together we knew that his mother’s brother was lord holdhurst, the great conservative politician. this gaudy relationship did him little good at school. on the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. but it was another thing when he came out into the world. i heard vaguely that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won him a good position at the foreign office, and then he passed completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence: briarbrae, woking. my dear watson,—i have no doubt that you can remember “tadpole” phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in the third. it is possible even that you may have heard that through my uncle’s influence i obtained a good appointment at the foreign office, and that i was in a situation of trust and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast my career. there is no use writing of the details of that dreadful event. in the event of your acceding to my request it is probable that i shall have to narrate them to you. i have only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am still exceedingly weak. do you think that you could bring your friend mr. holmes down to see me? i should like to have his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done. do try to bring him down, and as soon as possible. every minute seems an hour while i live in this state of horrible suspense. assure him that if i have not asked his advice sooner it was not because i did not appreciate his talents, but because i have been off my head ever since the blow fell. now i am clear again, though i dare not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. i am still so weak that i have to write, as you see, by dictating. do try to bring him. your old schoolfellow, percy phelps. there was something that touched me as i read this letter, something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes. so moved was i that even had it been a difficult matter i should have tried it, but of course i knew well that holmes loved his art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client could be to receive it. my wife agreed with me that not a moment should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an hour of breakfast-time i found myself back once more in the old rooms in baker street. holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown, and working hard over a chemical investigation. a large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a bunsen burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure. my friend hardly glanced up as i entered, and i, seeing that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an armchair and waited. he dipped into this bottle or that, drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. in his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper. “you come at a crisis, watson,” said he. “if this paper remains blue, all is well. if it turns red, it means a man’s life.” he dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson. “hum! i thought as much!” he cried. “i will be at your service in an instant, watson. you will find tobacco in the persian slipper.” he turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. then he threw himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins. “a very commonplace little murder,” said he. “you’ve got something better, i fancy. you are the stormy petrel of crime, watson. what is it?” i handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated attention. “it does not tell us very much, does it?” he remarked, as he handed it back to me. “hardly anything.” “and yet the writing is of interest.” “but the writing is not his own.” “precisely. it is a woman’s.” “a man’s surely,” i cried. “no, a woman’s, and a woman of rare character. you see, at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your client is in close contact with some one who, for good or evil, has an exceptional nature. my interest is already awakened in the case. if you are ready we will start at once for woking, and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he dictates his letters.” we were fortunate enough to catch an early train at waterloo, and in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods and the heather of woking. briarbrae proved to be a large detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few minutes’ walk of the station. on sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us with much hospitality. his age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy. “i am so glad that you have come,” said he, shaking our hands with effusion. “percy has been inquiring for you all morning. ah, poor old chap, he clings to any straw! his father and his mother asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very painful to them.” “we have had no details yet,” observed holmes. “i perceive that you are not yourself a member of the family.” our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he began to laugh. “of course you saw the ‘j.h.’ monogram on my locket,” said he. “for a moment i thought you had done something clever. joseph harrison is my name, and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a relation by marriage. you will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months back. perhaps we’d better go in at once, for i know how impatient he is.” the chamber in which we were shown was on the same floor as the drawing-room. it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner. a young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air. a woman was sitting beside him, who rose as we entered. “shall i leave, percy?” she asked. he clutched her hand to detain her. “how are you, watson?” said he, cordially. “i should never have known you under that moustache, and i daresay you would not be prepared to swear to me. this i presume is your celebrated friend, mr. sherlock holmes?” i introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. the stout young man had left us, but his sister still remained with her hand in that of the invalid. she was a striking-looking woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark, italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair. her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast. “i won’t waste your time,” said he, raising himself upon the sofa. “i’ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. i was a happy and successful man, mr. holmes, and on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life. “i was, as watson may have told you, in the foreign office, and through the influences of my uncle, lord holdhurst, i rose rapidly to a responsible position. when my uncle became foreign minister in this administration he gave me several missions of trust, and as i always brought them to a successful conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and tact. “nearly ten weeks ago—to be more accurate, on the 23rd of may—he called me into his private room, and, after complimenting me on the good work which i had done, he informed me that he had a new commission of trust for me to execute. “‘this,’ said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau, ‘is the original of that secret treaty between england and italy of which, i regret to say, some rumours have already got into the public press. it is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out. the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. they should not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary to have them copied. you have a desk in your office?’ “‘yes, sir.’ “‘then take the treaty and lock it up there. i shall give directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked. when you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.’ “i took the papers and—” “excuse me an instant,” said holmes. “were you alone during this conversation?” “absolutely.” “in a large room?” “thirty feet each way.” “in the centre?” “yes, about it.” “and speaking low?” “my uncle’s voice is always remarkably low. i hardly spoke at all.” “thank you,” said holmes, shutting his eyes; “pray go on.” “i did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other clerks had departed. one of them in my room, charles gorot, had some arrears of work to make up, so i left him there and went out to dine. when i returned he was gone. i was anxious to hurry my work, for i knew that joseph—the mr. harrison whom you saw just now—was in town, and that he would travel down to woking by the eleven o’clock train, and i wanted if possible to catch it. “when i came to examine the treaty i saw at once that it was of such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration in what he had said. without going into details, i may say that it defined the position of great britain towards the triple alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would pursue in the event of the french fleet gaining a complete ascendancy over that of italy in the mediterranean. the questions treated in it were purely naval. at the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries who had signed it. i glanced my eyes over it, and then settled down to my task of copying. “it was a long document, written in the french language, and containing twenty-six separate articles. i copied as quickly as i could, but at nine o’clock i had only done nine articles, and it seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. i was feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day’s work. a cup of coffee would clear my brain. a commissionnaire remains all night in a little lodge at the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working over time. i rang the bell, therefore, to summon him. “to my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. she explained that she was the commissionnaire’s wife, who did the charing, and i gave her the order for the coffee. “i wrote two more articles and then, feeling more drowsy than ever, i rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs. my coffee had not yet come, and i wondered what the cause of the delay could be. opening the door, i started down the corridor to find out. there was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led from the room in which i had been working, and was the only exit from it. it ended in a curving staircase, with the commissionnaire’s lodge in the passage at the bottom. half-way down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage running into it at right angles. this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street. here is a rough chart of the place.” rough chart “thank you. i think that i quite follow you,” said sherlock holmes. “it is of the utmost importance that you should notice this point. i went down the stairs and into the hall, where i found the commissionnaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. i took off the kettle and blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor. then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly, and he woke with a start. “‘mr. phelps, sir!’ said he, looking at me in bewilderment. “‘i came down to see if my coffee was ready.’ “‘i was boiling the kettle when i fell asleep, sir.’ he looked at me and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face. “‘if you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?’ he asked. “‘the bell!’ i cried. ‘what bell is it?’ “‘it’s the bell of the room you were working in.’ “a cold hand seemed to close round my heart. some one, then, was in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. i ran frantically up the stairs and along the passage. there was no one in the corridors, mr. holmes. there was no one in the room. all was exactly as i left it, save only that the papers which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay. the copy was there, and the original was gone.” holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. i could see that the problem was entirely to his heart. “pray, what did you do then?” he murmured. “i recognised in an instant that the thief must have come up the stairs from the side door. of course i must have met him if he had come the other way.” “you were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just described as dimly lighted?” “it is absolutely impossible. a rat could not conceal himself either in the room or the corridor. there is no cover at all.” “thank you. pray proceed.” “the commissionnaire, seeing by my pale face that something was to be feared, had followed me upstairs. now we both rushed along the corridor and down the steep steps which led to charles street. the door at the bottom was closed, but unlocked. we flung it open and rushed out. i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chimes from a neighbouring clock. it was quarter to ten.” “that is of enormous importance,” said holmes, making a note upon his shirt-cuff. “the night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling. there was no one in charles street, but a great traffic was going on, as usual, in whitehall, at the extremity. we rushed along the pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found a policeman standing. “‘a robbery has been committed,’ i gasped. ‘a document of immense value has been stolen from the foreign office. has any one passed this way?’ “‘i have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,’ said he; ‘only one person has passed during that time—a woman, tall and elderly, with a paisley shawl.’ “‘ah, that is only my wife,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘has no one else passed?’ “‘no one.’ “‘then it must be the other way that the thief took,’ cried the fellow, tugging at my sleeve. “‘but i was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw me away increased my suspicions. “‘which way did the woman go?’ i cried. “‘i don’t know, sir. i noticed her pass, but i had no special reason for watching her. she seemed to be in a hurry.’ “‘how long ago was it?’ “‘oh, not very many minutes.’ “‘within the last five?’ “‘well, it could not be more than five.’ “‘you’re only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of importance,’ cried the commissionnaire; ‘take my word for it that my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the other end of the street. well, if you won’t, i will.’ and with that he rushed off in the other direction. “but i was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve. “‘where do you live?’ said i. “‘16 ivy lane, brixton,’ he answered. ‘but don’t let yourself be drawn away upon a false scent, mr. phelps. come to the other end of the street and let us see if we can hear of anything.’ “nothing was to be lost by following his advice. with the policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. there was no lounger who could tell us who had passed. “then we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the passage without result. the corridor which led to the room was laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an impression very easily. we examined it very carefully, but found no outline of any footmark.” “had it been raining all evening?” “since about seven.” “how is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about nine left no traces with her muddy boots?” “i am glad you raised the point. it occurred to me at the time. the charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the commissionnaire’s office, and putting on list slippers.” “that is very clear. there were no marks, then, though the night was a wet one? the chain of events is certainly one of extraordinary interest. what did you do next? “we examined the room also. there is no possibility of a secret door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. both of them were fastened on the inside. the carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind. i will pledge my life that whoever stole my papers could only have come through the door.” “how about the fireplace?” “they use none. there is a stove. the bell-rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk. whoever rang it must have come right up to the desk to do it. but why should any criminal wish to ring the bell? it is a most insoluble mystery.” “certainly the incident was unusual. what were your next steps? you examined the room, i presume, to see if the intruder had left any traces—any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other trifle?” “there was nothing of the sort.” “no smell?” “well, we never thought of that.” “ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us in such an investigation.” “i never smoke myself, so i think i should have observed it if there had been any smell of tobacco. there was absolutely no clue of any kind. the only tangible fact was that the commissionnaire’s wife—mrs. tangey was the name—had hurried out of the place. he could give no explanation save that it was about the time when the woman always went home. the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them. “the alarm had reached scotland yard by this time, and mr. forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case with a great deal of energy. we hired a hansom, and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us. a young woman opened the door, who proved to be mrs. tangey’s eldest daughter. her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown into the front room to wait. “about ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we made the one serious mistake for which i blame myself. instead of opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. we heard her say, ‘mother, there are two men in the house waiting to see you,’ and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down the passage. forbes flung open the door, and we both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there before us. she stared at us with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly recognising me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face. “‘why, if it isn’t mr. phelps, of the office!’ she cried. “‘come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?’ asked my companion. “‘i thought you were the brokers,’ said she, ‘we have had some trouble with a tradesman.’ “‘that’s not quite good enough,’ answered forbes. ‘we have reason to believe that you have taken a paper of importance from the foreign office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. you must come back with us to scotland yard to be searched.’ “it was in vain that she protested and resisted. a four-wheeler was brought, and we all three drove back in it. we had first made an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers during the instant that she was alone. there were no signs, however, of any ashes or scraps. when we reached scotland yard she was handed over at once to the female searcher. i waited in an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. there were no signs of the papers. “then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its full force. hitherto i had been acting, and action had numbed thought. i had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once that i had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if i failed to do so. but now there was nothing more to be done, and i had leisure to realize my position. it was horrible. watson there would tell you that i was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. it is my nature. i thought of my uncle and of his colleagues in the cabinet, of the shame which i had brought upon him, upon myself, upon every one connected with me. what though i was the victim of an extraordinary accident? no allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. i was ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. i don’t know what i did. i fancy i must have made a scene. i have a dim recollection of a group of officials who crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe me. one of them drove down with me to waterloo, and saw me into the woking train. i believe that he would have come all the way had it not been that dr. ferrier, who lives near me, was going down by that very train. the doctor most kindly took charge of me, and it was well he did so, for i had a fit in the station, and before we reached home i was practically a raving maniac. “you can imagine the state of things here when they were roused from their beds by the doctor’s ringing and found me in this condition. poor annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. dr. ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story did not mend matters. it was evident to all that i was in for a long illness, so joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom, and it was turned into a sick-room for me. here i have lain, mr. holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain-fever. if it had not been for miss harrison here and for the doctor’s care i should not be speaking to you now. she has nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits i was capable of anything. slowly my reason has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned. sometimes i wish that it never had. the first thing that i did was to wire to mr. forbes, who had the case in hand. he came out, and assures me that, though everything has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. the commissionnaire and his wife have been examined in every way without any light being thrown upon the matter. the suspicions of the police then rested upon young gorot, who, as you may remember, stayed over time in the office that night. his remaining behind and his french name were really the only two points which could suggest suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, i did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of huguenot extraction, but as english in sympathy and tradition as you and i are. nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and there the matter dropped. i turn to you, mr. holmes, as absolutely my last hope. if you fail me, then my honour as well as my position are forever forfeited.” the invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some stimulating medicine. holmes sat silently, with his head thrown back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem listless to a stranger, but which i knew betokened the most intense self-absorption. “you statement has been so explicit,” said he at last, “that you have really left me very few questions to ask. there is one of the very utmost importance, however. did you tell any one that you had this special task to perform?” “no one.” “not miss harrison here, for example?” “no. i had not been back to woking between getting the order and executing the commission.” “and none of your people had by chance been to see you?” “none.” “did any of them know their way about in the office?” “oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.” “still, of course, if you said nothing to any one about the treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.” “i said nothing.” “do you know anything of the commissionnaire?” “nothing except that he is an old soldier.” “what regiment?” “oh, i have heard—coldstream guards.” “thank you. i have no doubt i can get details from forbes. the authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not always use them to advantage. what a lovely thing a rose is!” he walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. it was a new phase of his character to me, for i had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects. “there is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,” said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. “it can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. our highest assurance of the goodness of providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. all other things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. but this rose is an extra. its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. it is only goodness which gives extras, and so i say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.” percy phelps and his nurse looked at holmes during this demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment written upon their faces. he had fallen into a reverie, with the moss-rose between his fingers. it had lasted some minutes before the young lady broke in upon it. “do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, mr. holmes?” she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice. “oh, the mystery!” he answered, coming back with a start to the realities of life. “well, it would be absurd to deny that the case is a very abstruse and complicated one, but i can promise you that i will look into the matter and let you know any points which may strike me.” “do you see any clue?” “you have furnished me with seven, but, of course, i must test them before i can pronounce upon their value.” “you suspect some one?” “i suspect myself.” “what!” “of coming to conclusions too rapidly.” “then go to london and test your conclusions.” “your advice is very excellent, miss harrison,” said holmes, rising. “i think, watson, we cannot do better. do not allow yourself to indulge in false hopes, mr. phelps. the affair is a very tangled one.” “i shall be in a fever until i see you again,” cried the diplomatist. “well, i’ll come out by the same train to-morrow, though it’s more than likely that my report will be a negative one.” “god bless you for promising to come,” cried our client. “it gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. by the way, i have had a letter from lord holdhurst.” “ha! what did he say?” “he was cold, but not harsh. i daresay my severe illness prevented him from being that. he repeated that the matter was of the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken about my future—by which he means, of course, my dismissal—until my health was restored and i had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.” “well, that was reasonable and considerate,” said holmes. “come, watson, for we have a good day’s work before us in town.” mr. joseph harrison drove us down to the station, and we were soon whirling up in a portsmouth train. holmes was sunk in profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed clapham junction. “it’s a very cheery thing to come into london by any of these lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses like this.” i thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself. “look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.” “the board-schools.” “light-houses, my boy! beacons of the future! capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wise, better england of the future. i suppose that man phelps does not drink?” “i should not think so.” “nor should i, but we are bound to take every possibility into account. the poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep water, and it’s a question whether we shall ever be able to get him ashore. what did you think of miss harrison?” “a girl of strong character.” “yes, but she is a good sort, or i am mistaken. she and her brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up northumberland way. he got engaged to her when traveling last winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with her brother as escort. then came the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too. i’ve been making a few independent inquiries, you see. but to-day must be a day of inquiries.” “my practice—” i began. “oh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mine—” said holmes, with some asperity. “i was going to say that my practice could get along very well for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.” “excellent,” said he, recovering his good-humour. “then we’ll look into this matter together. i think that we should begin by seeing forbes. he can probably tell us all the details we want until we know from what side the case is to be approached.” “you said you had a clue?” “well, we have several, but we can only test their value by further inquiry. the most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless. now this is not purposeless. who is it who profits by it? there is the french ambassador, there is the russian, there is whoever might sell it to either of these, and there is lord holdhurst.” “lord holdhurst!” “well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed.” “not a statesman with the honourable record of lord holdhurst?” “it is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it. we shall see the noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us anything. meanwhile i have already set inquiries on foot.” “already?” “yes, i sent wires from woking station to every evening paper in london. this advertisement will appear in each of them.” he handed over a sheet torn from a note-book. on it was scribbled in pencil: “£10 reward.—the number of the cab which dropped a fare at or about the door of the foreign office in charles street at quarter to ten in the evening of may 23rd. apply 221b, baker street.” “you are confident that the thief came in a cab?” “if not, there is no harm done. but if mr. phelps is correct in stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the corridors, then the person must have come from outside. if he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes of his passing, then it is exceeding probable that he came in a cab. yes, i think that we may safely deduce a cab.” “it sounds plausible.” “that is one of the clues of which i spoke. it may lead us to something. and then, of course, there is the bell—which is the most distinctive feature of the case. why should the bell ring? was it the thief who did it out of bravado? or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime? or was it an accident? or was it—?” he sank back into the state of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged; but it seemed to me, accustomed as i was to his every mood, that some new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him. it was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to scotland yard. holmes had already wired to forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us—a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. he was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come. “i’ve heard of your methods before now, mr. holmes,” said he, tartly. “you are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them.” “on the contrary,” said holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. i don’t blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me.” “i’d be very glad of a hint or two,” said the detective, changing his manner. “i’ve certainly had no credit from the case so far.” “what steps have you taken?” “tangey, the commissionnaire, has been shadowed. he left the guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him. his wife is a bad lot, though. i fancy she knows more about this than appears.” “have you shadowed her?” “we have set one of our women on to her. mrs. tangey drinks, and our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she could get nothing out of her.” “i understand that they have had brokers in the house?” “yes, but they were paid off.” “where did the money come from?” “that was all right. his pension was due. they have not shown any sign of being in funds.” “what explanation did she give of having answered the bell when mr. phelps rang for the coffee?” “she said that her husband was very tired and she wished to relieve him.” “well, certainly that would agree with his being found a little later asleep in his chair. there is nothing against them then but the woman’s character. did you ask her why she hurried away that night? her haste attracted the attention of the police constable.” “she was later than usual and wanted to get home.” “did you point out to her that you and mr. phelps, who started at least twenty minutes after her, got home before her?” “she explains that by the difference between a ‘bus and a hansom.” “did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?” “because she had the money there with which to pay off the brokers.” “she has at least an answer for everything. did you ask her whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about charles street?” “she saw no one but the constable.” “well, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly. what else have you done?” “the clerk gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but without result. we can show nothing against him.” “anything else?” “well, we have nothing else to go upon—no evidence of any kind.” “have you formed a theory about how that bell rang?” “well, i must confess that it beats me. it was a cool hand, whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.” “yes, it was a queer thing to do. many thanks to you for what you have told me. if i can put the man into your hands you shall hear from me. come along, watson.” “where are we going to now?” i asked, as we left the office. “we are now going to interview lord holdhurst, the cabinet minister and future premier of england.” we were fortunate in finding that lord holdhurst was still in his chambers in downing street, and on holmes sending in his card we were instantly shown up. the statesman received us with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace. standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common type, a nobleman who is in truth noble. “your name is very familiar to me, mr. holmes,” said he, smiling. “and, of course, i cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit. there has only been one occurrence in these offices which could call for your attention. in whose interest are you acting, may i ask?” “in that of mr. percy phelps,” answered holmes. “ah, my unfortunate nephew! you can understand that our kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. i fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon his career.” “but if the document is found?” “ah, that, of course, would be different.” “i had one or two questions which i wished to ask you, lord holdhurst.” “i shall be happy to give you any information in my power.” “was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?” “it was.” “then you could hardly have been overheard?” “it is out of the question.” “did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied?” “never.” “you are certain of that?” “absolutely.” “well, since you never said so, and mr. phelps never said so, and nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thief’s presence in the room was purely accidental. he saw his chance and he took it.” the statesman smiled. “you take me out of my province there,” said he. holmes considered for a moment. “there is another very important point which i wish to discuss with you,” said he. “you feared, as i understand, that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known.” a shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. “very grave results indeed.” “and have they occurred?” “not yet.” “if the treaty had reached, let us say, the french or russian foreign office, you would expect to hear of it?” “i should,” said lord holdhurst, with a wry face. “since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty has not reached them.” lord holdhurst shrugged his shoulders. “we can hardly suppose, mr. holmes, that the thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.” “perhaps he is waiting for a better price.” “if he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. the treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.” “that is most important,” said holmes. “of course, it is a possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness—” “an attack of brain-fever, for example?” asked the statesman, flashing a swift glance at him. “i did not say so,” said holmes, imperturbably. “and now, lord holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable time, and we shall wish you good-day.” “every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it may,” answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door. “he’s a fine fellow,” said holmes, as we came out into whitehall. “but he has a struggle to keep up his position. he is far from rich and has many calls. you noticed, of course, that his boots had been resoled. now, watson, i won’t detain you from your legitimate work any longer. i shall do nothing more to-day, unless i have an answer to my cab advertisement. but i should be extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to woking to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.” i met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to woking together. he had had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. he had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a red indian, and i could not gather from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not with the position of the case. his conversation, i remember, was about the bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the french savant. we found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better than before. he rose from the sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered. “any news?” he asked, eagerly. “my report, as i expected, is a negative one,” said holmes. “i have seen forbes, and i have seen your uncle, and i have set one or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.” “you have not lost heart, then?” “by no means.” “god bless you for saying that!” cried miss harrison. “if we keep our courage and our patience the truth must come out.” “we have more to tell you than you have for us,” said phelps, reseating himself upon the couch. “i hoped you might have something.” “yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which might have proved to be a serious one.” his expression grew very grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up in his eyes. “do you know,” said he, “that i begin to believe that i am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?” “ah!” cried holmes. “it sounds incredible, for i have not, as far as i know, an enemy in the world. yet from last night’s experience i can come to no other conclusion.” “pray let me hear it.” “you must know that last night was the very first night that i have ever slept without a nurse in the room. i was so much better that i thought i could dispense with one. i had a night-light burning, however. well, about two in the morning i had sunk into a light sleep when i was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. it was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and i lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it must come from that cause. then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic snick. i sat up in amazement. there could be no doubt what the sounds were now. the first ones had been caused by some one forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed back. “there was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. then i heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. i could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to be. i sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. a man was crouching at the window. i could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. he was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face. one thing only i am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. it looked to me like a long knife. i distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run.” “this is most interesting,” said holmes. “pray what did you do then?” “i should have followed him through the open window if i had been stronger. as it was, i rang the bell and roused the house. it took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and the servants all sleep upstairs. i shouted, however, and that brought joseph down, and he roused the others. joseph and the groom found marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across the grass. there’s a place, however, on the wooden fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if some one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so. i have said nothing to the local police yet, for i thought i had best have your opinion first.” this tale of our client’s appeared to have an extraordinary effect upon sherlock holmes. he rose from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable excitement. “misfortunes never come single,” said phelps, smiling, though it was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him. “you have certainly had your share,” said holmes. “do you think you could walk round the house with me?” “oh, yes, i should like a little sunshine. joseph will come, too.” “and i also,” said miss harrison. “i am afraid not,” said holmes, shaking his head. “i think i must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.” the young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. her brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together. we passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist’s window. there were, as he had said, marks upon the bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. holmes stopped over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders. “i don’t think any one could make much of this,” said he. “let us go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by the burglar. i should have thought those larger windows of the drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for him.” “they are more visible from the road,” suggested mr. joseph harrison. “ah, yes, of course. there is a door here which he might have attempted. what is it for?” “it is the side entrance for trades-people. of course it is locked at night.” “have you ever had an alarm like this before?” “never,” said our client. “do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?” “nothing of value.” holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and a negligent air which was unusual with him. “by the way,” said he to joseph harrison, “you found some place, i understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. let us have a look at that!” the plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the wooden rails had been cracked. a small fragment of the wood was hanging down. holmes pulled it off and examined it critically. “do you think that was done last night? it looks rather old, does it not?” “well, possibly so.” “there are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side. no, i fancy we shall get no help here. let us go back to the bedroom and talk the matter over.” percy phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his future brother-in-law. holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others came up. “miss harrison,” said holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity of manner, “you must stay where you are all day. let nothing prevent you from staying where you are all day. it is of the utmost importance.” “certainly, if you wish it, mr. holmes,” said the girl in astonishment. “when you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and keep the key. promise to do this.” “but percy?” “he will come to london with us.” “and am i to remain here?” “it is for his sake. you can serve him. quick! promise!” she gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two came up. “why do you sit moping there, annie?” cried her brother. “come out into the sunshine!” “no, thank you, joseph. i have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing.” “what do you propose now, mr. holmes?” asked our client. “well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry. it would be a very great help to me if you would come up to london with us.” “at once?” “well, as soon as you conveniently can. say in an hour.” “i feel quite strong enough, if i can really be of any help.” “the greatest possible.” “perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?” “i was just going to propose it.” “then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown. we are all in your hands, mr. holmes, and you must tell us exactly what you would like done. perhaps you would prefer that joseph came with us so as to look after me?” “oh, no; my friend watson is a medical man, you know, and he’ll look after you. we’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town together.” it was arranged as he suggested, though miss harrison excused herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with holmes’s suggestion. what the object of my friend’s manœuvres was i could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from phelps, who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of action, lunched with us in the dining-room. holmes had a still more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly announced that he had no intention of leaving woking. “there are one or two small points which i should desire to clear up before i go,” said he. “your absence, mr. phelps, will in some ways rather assist me. watson, when you reach london you would oblige me by driving at once to baker street with our friend here, and remaining with him until i see you again. it is fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much to talk over. mr. phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and i will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me into waterloo at eight.” “but how about our investigation in london?” asked phelps, ruefully. “we can do that to-morrow. i think that just at present i can be of more immediate use here.” “you might tell them at briarbrae that i hope to be back to-morrow night,” cried phelps, as we began to move from the platform. “i hardly expect to go back to briarbrae,” answered holmes, and waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station. phelps and i talked it over on our journey, but neither of us could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development. “i suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last night, if a burglar it was. for myself, i don’t believe it was an ordinary thief.” “what is your own idea, then?” “upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but i believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life is aimed at by the conspirators. it sounds high-flown and absurd, but consider the facts! why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why should he come with a long knife in his hand?” “you are sure it was not a house-breaker’s jimmy?” “oh, no, it was a knife. i saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly.” “but why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?” “ah, that is the question.” “well, if holmes takes the same view, that would account for his action, would it not? presuming that your theory is correct, if he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval treaty. it is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.” “but holmes said that he was not going to briarbrae.” “i have known him for some time,” said i, “but i never knew him do anything yet without a very good reason,” and with that our conversation drifted off on to other topics. but it was a weary day for me. phelps was still weak after his long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous. in vain i endeavoured to interest him in afghanistan, in india, in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of the groove. he would always come back to his lost treaty, wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what holmes was doing, what steps lord holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in the morning. as the evening wore on his excitement became quite painful. “you have implicit faith in holmes?” he asked. “i have seen him do some remarkable things.” “but he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?” “oh, yes; i have known him solve questions which presented fewer clues than yours.” “but not where such large interests are at stake?” “i don’t know that. to my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning houses of europe in very vital matters.” “but you know him well, watson. he is such an inscrutable fellow that i never quite know what to make of him. do you think he is hopeful? do you think he expects to make a success of it?” “he has said nothing.” “that is a bad sign.” “on the contrary, i have noticed that when he is off the trail he generally says so. it is when he is on a scent and is not quite absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most taciturn. now, my dear fellow, we can’t help matters by making ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.” i was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice, though i knew from his excited manner that there was not much hope of sleep for him. indeed, his mood was infectious, for i lay tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more impossible than the last. why had holmes remained at woking? why had he asked miss harrison to remain in the sick-room all day? why had he been so careful not to inform the people at briarbrae that he intended to remain near them? i cudgelled my brains until i fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which would cover all these facts. it was seven o’clock when i awoke, and i set off at once for phelps’s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless night. his first question was whether holmes had arrived yet. “he’ll be here when he promised,” said i, “and not an instant sooner or later.” and my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed up to the door and our friend got out of it. standing in the window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his face was very grim and pale. he entered the house, but it was some little time before he came upstairs. “he looks like a beaten man,” cried phelps. i was forced to confess that he was right. “after all,” said i, “the clue of the matter lies probably here in town.” phelps gave a groan. “i don’t know how it is,” said he, “but i had hoped for so much from his return. but surely his hand was not tied up like that yesterday. what can be the matter?” “you are not wounded, holmes?” i asked, as my friend entered the room. “tut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,” he answered, nodding his good-mornings to us. “this case of yours, mr. phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which i have ever investigated.” “i feared that you would find it beyond you.” “it has been a most remarkable experience.” “that bandage tells of adventures,” said i. “won’t you tell us what has happened?” “after breakfast, my dear watson. remember that i have breathed thirty miles of surrey air this morning. i suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement? well, well, we cannot expect to score every time.” the table was all laid, and just as i was about to ring mrs. hudson entered with the tea and coffee. a few minutes later she brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, holmes ravenous, i curious, and phelps in the gloomiest state of depression. “mrs. hudson has risen to the occasion,” said holmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken. “her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a scotch-woman. what have you here, watson?” “ham and eggs,” i answered. “good! what are you going to take, mr. phelps—curried fowl or eggs, or will you help yourself?” “thank you. i can eat nothing,” said phelps. “oh, come! try the dish before you.” “thank you, i would really rather not.” “well, then,” said holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, “i suppose that you have no objection to helping me?” phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked. across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-grey paper. he caught it up, devoured it with his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. then he fell back into an armchair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting. “there! there!” said holmes, soothing, patting him upon the shoulder. “it was too bad to spring it on you like this, but watson here will tell you that i never can resist a touch of the dramatic.” phelps seized his hand and kissed it. “god bless you!” he cried. “you have saved my honour.” “well, my own was at stake, you know,” said holmes. “i assure you it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a commission.” phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost pocket of his coat. “i have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further, and yet i am dying to know how you got it and where it was.” sherlock holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his attention to the ham and eggs. then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down into his chair. “i’ll tell you what i did first, and how i came to do it afterwards,” said he. “after leaving you at the station i went for a charming walk through some admirable surrey scenery to a pretty little village called ripley, where i had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. there i remained until evening, when i set off for woking again, and found myself in the high-road outside briarbrae just after sunset. “well, i waited until the road was clear—it is never a very frequented one at any time, i fancy—and then i clambered over the fence into the grounds.” “surely the gate was open!” ejaculated phelps. “yes, but i have a peculiar taste in these matters. i chose the place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen i got over without the least chance of any one in the house being able to see me. i crouched down among the bushes on the other side, and crawled from one to the other—witness the disreputable state of my trouser knees—until i had reached the clump of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. there i squatted down and awaited developments. “the blind was not down in your room, and i could see miss harrison sitting there reading by the table. it was quarter-past ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired. “i heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.” “the key!” ejaculated phelps. “yes; i had given miss harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. she carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper in your coat-pocket. she departed then and the lights went out, and i was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush. “the night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. of course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big game. it was very long, though—almost as long, watson, as when you and i waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the speckled band. there was a church-clock down at woking which struck the quarters, and i thought more than once that it had stopped. at last however about two in the morning, i suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and the creaking of a key. a moment later the servants’ door was opened, and mr. joseph harrison stepped out into the moonlight.” “joseph!” ejaculated phelps. “he was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there were any alarm. he walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall, and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed back the catch. then he flung open the window, and putting his knife through the crack in the shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open. “from where i lay i had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. he lit the two candles which stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes. this one covered, as a matter of fact, the t joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as i stood waiting for him outside the window. “well, he has rather more viciousness than i gave him credit for, has master joseph. he flew at me with his knife, and i had to grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before i had the upper hand of him. he looked murder out of the only eye he could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason and gave up the papers. having got them i let my man go, but i wired full particulars to forbes this morning. if he is quick enough to catch his bird, well and good. but if, as i shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all the better for the government. i fancy that lord holdhurst for one, and mr. percy phelps for another, would very much rather that the affair never got as far as a police-court. “my god!” gasped our client. “do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time?” “so it was.” “and joseph! joseph a villain and a thief!” “hum! i am afraid joseph’s character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. from what i have heard from him this morning, i gather that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better his fortunes. being an absolutely selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow either his sister’s happiness or your reputation to hold his hand.” percy phelps sank back in his chair. “my head whirls,” said he. “your words have dazed me.” “the principal difficulty in your case,” remarked holmes, in his didactic fashion, “lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. what was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. i had already begun to suspect joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should call for you, knowing the foreign office well, upon his way. when i heard that some one had been so anxious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but joseph could have concealed anything—you told us in your narrative how you had turned joseph out when you arrived with the doctor—my suspicions all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.” “how blind i have been!” “the facts of the case, as far as i have worked them out, are these: this joseph harrison entered the office through the charles street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into your room the instant after you left it. finding no one there he promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his eyes caught the paper upon the table. a glance showed him that chance had put in his way a state document of immense value, and in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. a few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy commissionnaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were just enough to give the thief time to make his escape. “he made his way to woking by the first train, and having examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying it to the french embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had. then came your sudden return. he, without a moment’s warning, was bundled out of his room, and from that time onward there were always at least two of you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. the situation to him must have been a maddening one. but at last he thought he saw his chance. he tried to steal in, but was baffled by your wakefulness. you remember that you did not take your usual draught that night.” “i remember.” “i fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious. of course, i understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be done with safety. your leaving the room gave him the chance he wanted. i kept miss harrison in it all day so that he might not anticipate us. then, having given him the idea that the coast was clear, i kept guard as i have described. i already knew that the papers were probably in the room, but i had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting in search of them. i let him take them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. is there any other point which i can make clear?” “why did he try the window on the first occasion,” i asked, “when he might have entered by the door?” “in reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. on the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease. anything else?” “you do not think,” asked phelps, “that he had any murderous intention? the knife was only meant as a tool.” “it may be so,” answered holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “i can only say for certain that mr. joseph harrison is a gentleman to whose mercy i should be extremely unwilling to trust.” xii. the final problem it is with a heavy heart that i take up my pen to write these the last words in which i shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend mr. sherlock holmes was distinguished. in an incoherent and, as i deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, i have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the “study in scarlet,” up to the time of his interference in the matter of the “naval treaty”—an interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. it was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill. my hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which colonel james moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and i have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred. i alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and i am satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression. as far as i know, there have been only three accounts in the public press: that in the _journal de genève_ on may 6th, 1891, the reuter’s despatch in the english papers on may 7th, and finally the recent letter to which i have alluded. of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as i shall now show, an absolute perversion of the facts. it lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between professor moriarty and mr. sherlock holmes. it may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between holmes and myself became to some extent modified. he still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his investigation, but these occasions grew more and more seldom, until i find that in the year 1890 there were only three cases of which i retain any record. during the winter of that year and the early spring of 1891, i saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the french government upon a matter of supreme importance, and i received two notes from holmes, dated from narbonne and from nimes, from which i gathered that his stay in france was likely to be a long one. it was with some surprise, therefore, that i saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of the 24th of april. it struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual. “yes, i have been using myself up rather too freely,” he remarked, in answer to my look rather than to my words; “i have been a little pressed of late. have you any objection to my closing your shutters?” the only light in the room came from the lamp upon the table at which i had been reading. holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the shutters together, he bolted them securely. “you are afraid of something?” i asked. “well, i am.” “of what?” “of air-guns.” “my dear holmes, what do you mean?” “i think that you know me well enough, watson, to understand that i am by no means a nervous man. at the same time, it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognise danger when it is close upon you. might i trouble you for a match?” he drew in the smoke of his cigarette as if the soothing influence was grateful to him. “i must apologise for calling so late,” said he, “and i must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall.” “but what does it all mean?” i asked. he held out his hand, and i saw in the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and bleeding. “it is not an airy nothing, you see,” said he, smiling. “on the contrary, it is solid enough for a man to break his hand over. is mrs. watson in?” “she is away upon a visit.” “indeed! you are alone?” “quite.” “then it makes it the easier for me to propose that you should come away with me for a week to the continent.” “where?” “oh, anywhere. it’s all the same to me.” there was something very strange in all this. it was not holmes’s nature to take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale, worn face told me that his nerves were at their highest tension. he saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation. “you have probably never heard of professor moriarty?” said he. “never.” “aye, there’s the genius and the wonder of the thing!” he cried. “the man pervades london, and no one has heard of him. that’s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. i tell you, watson, in all seriousness, that if i could beat that man, if i could free society of him, i should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and i should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. between ourselves, the recent cases in which i have been of assistance to the royal family of scandinavia, and to the french republic, have left me in such a position that i could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. but i could not rest, watson, i could not sit quiet in my chair, if i thought that such a man as professor moriarty were walking the streets of london unchallenged.” “what has he done, then?” “his career has been an extraordinary one. he is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. at the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the binomial theorem, which has had a european vogue. on the strength of it he won the mathematical chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearances, a most brilliant career before him. but the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. a criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. dark rumours gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to london, where he set up as an army coach. so much is known to the world, but what i am telling you now is what i have myself discovered. “as you are aware, watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of london so well as i do. for years past i have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. again and again in cases of the most varying sorts—forgery cases, robberies, murders—i have felt the presence of this force, and i have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which i have not been personally consulted. for years i have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when i seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-professor moriarty of mathematical celebrity. “he is the napoleon of crime, watson. he is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. he is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. he has a brain of the first order. he sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. he does little himself. he only plans. but his agents are numerous and splendidly organized. is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed—the word is passed to the professor, the matter is organized and carried out. the agent may be caught. in that case money is found for his bail or his defence. but the central power which uses the agent is never caught—never so much as suspected. this was the organization which i deduced, watson, and which i devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up. “but the professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what i would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict in a court of law. you know my powers, my dear watson, and yet at the end of three months i was forced to confess that i had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal. my horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill. but at last he made a trip—only a little, little trip—but it was more than he could afford when i was so close upon him. i had my chance, and, starting from that point, i have woven my net round him until now it is all ready to close. in three days—that is to say, on monday next—matters will be ripe, and the professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them; but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment. “now, if i could have done this without the knowledge of professor moriarty, all would have been well. but he was too wily for that. he saw every step which i took to draw my toils round him. again and again he strove to break away, but i as often headed him off. i tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. never have i risen to such a height, and never have i been so hard pressed by an opponent. he cut deep, and yet i just undercut him. this morning the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. i was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and professor moriarty stood before me. “my nerves are fairly proof, watson, but i must confess to a start when i saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshhold. his appearance was quite familiar to me. he is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in his head. he is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. his shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion. he peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes. “‘you have less frontal development than i should have expected,’ said he, at last. ‘it is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one’s dressing-gown.’ “the fact is that upon his entrance i had instantly recognised the extreme personal danger in which i lay. the only conceivable escape for him lay in silencing my tongue. in an instant i had slipped the revolver from the drawer into my pocket, and was covering him through the cloth. at his remark i drew the weapon out and laid it cocked upon the table. he still smiled and blinked, but there was something about his eyes which made me feel very glad that i had it there. “‘you evidently don’t know me,’ said he. “‘on the contrary,’ i answered, ‘i think it is fairly evident that i do. pray take a chair. i can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.’ “‘all that i have to say has already crossed your mind,’ said he. “‘then possibly my answer has crossed yours,’ i replied. “‘you stand fast?’ “‘absolutely.’ “he clapped his hand into his pocket, and i raised the pistol from the table. but he merely drew out a memorandum-book in which he had scribbled some dates. “‘you crossed my path on the 4th of january,’ said he. ‘on the 23rd you incommoded me; by the middle of february i was seriously inconvenienced by you; at the end of march i was absolutely hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of april, i find myself placed in such a position through your continual persecution that i am in positive danger of losing my liberty. the situation is becoming an impossible one.’ “‘have you any suggestion to make?’ i asked. “‘you must drop it, mr. holmes,’ said he, swaying his face about. ‘you really must, you know.’ “‘after monday,’ said i. “‘tut, tut,’ said he. ‘i am quite sure that a man of your intelligence will see that there can be but one outcome to this affair. it is necessary that you should withdraw. you have worked things in such a fashion that we have only one resource left. it has been an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which you have grappled with this affair, and i say, unaffectedly, that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take any extreme measure. you smile, sir, but i assure you that it really would.’ “‘danger is part of my trade,’ i remarked. “‘that is not danger,’ said he. ‘it is inevitable destruction. you stand in the way not merely of an individual, but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which you, with all your cleverness, have been unable to realize. you must stand clear, mr. holmes, or be trodden under foot.’ “‘i am afraid,’ said i, rising, ‘that in the pleasure of this conversation i am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.’ “he rose also and looked at me in silence, shaking his head sadly. “‘well, well,’ said he, at last. ‘it seems a pity, but i have done what i could. i know every move of your game. you can do nothing before monday. it has been a duel between you and me, mr. holmes. you hope to place me in the dock. i tell you that i will never stand in the dock. you hope to beat me. i tell you that you will never beat me. if you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that i shall do as much to you.’ “‘you have paid me several compliments, mr. moriarty,’ said i. ‘let me pay you one in return when i say that if i were assured of the former eventuality i would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.’ “‘i can promise you the one, but not the other,’ he snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon me, and went peering and blinking out of the room. “that was my singular interview with professor moriarty. i confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind. his soft, precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which a mere bully could not produce. of course, you will say: ‘why not take police precautions against him?’ the reason is that i am well convinced that it is from his agents the blow will fall. i have the best proofs that it would be so.” “you have already been assaulted?” “my dear watson, professor moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. i went out about midday to transact some business in oxford street. as i passed the corner which leads from bentinck street on to the welbeck street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. i sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. the van dashed round by marylebone lane and was gone in an instant. i kept to the pavement after that, watson, but as i walked down vere street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my feet. i called the police and had the place examined. there were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. of course i knew better, but i could prove nothing. i took a cab after that and reached my brother’s rooms in pall mall, where i spent the day. now i have come round to you, and on my way i was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. i knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but i can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth i have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, i daresay, working out problems upon a blackboard ten miles away. you will not wonder, watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that i have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.” i had often admired my friend’s courage, but never more than now, as he sat quietly checking off a series of incidents which must have combined to make up a day of horror. “you will spend the night here?” i said. “no, my friend, you might find me a dangerous guest. i have my plans laid, and all will be well. matters have gone so far now that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes, though my presence is necessary for a conviction. it is obvious, therefore, that i cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act. it would be a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come on to the continent with me.” “the practice is quiet,” said i, “and i have an accommodating neighbour. i should be glad to come.” “and to start to-morrow morning?” “if necessary.” “oh yes, it is most necessary. then these are your instructions, and i beg, my dear watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in europe. now listen! you will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to victoria to-night. in the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the strand end of the lowther arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past nine. you will find a small brougham waiting close to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red. into this you will step, and you will reach victoria in time for the continental express.” “where shall i meet you?” “at the station. the second first-class carriage from the front will be reserved for us.” “the carriage is our rendezvous, then?” “yes.” it was in vain that i asked holmes to remain for the evening. it was evident to me that he thought he might bring trouble to the roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled him to go. with a few hurried words as to our plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads into mortimer street, and immediately whistling for a hansom, in which i heard him drive away. in the morning i obeyed holmes’s injunctions to the letter. a hansom was procured with such precaution as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and i drove immediately after breakfast to the lowther arcade, through which i hurried at the top of my speed. a brougham was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that i had stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled off to victoria station. on my alighting there he turned the carriage, and dashed away again without so much as a look in my direction. so far all had gone admirably. my luggage was waiting for me, and i had no difficulty in finding the carriage which holmes had indicated, the less so as it was the only one in the train which was marked “engaged.” my only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of holmes. the station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. in vain i searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the lithe figure of my friend. there was no sign of him. i spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable italian priest, who was endeavouring to make a porter understand, in his broken english, that his luggage was to be booked through to paris. then, having taken another look round, i returned to my carriage, where i found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit italian friend as a traveling companion. it was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my italian was even more limited than his english, so i shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. a chill of fear had come over me, as i thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when— “my dear watson,” said a voice, “you have not even condescended to say good-morning.” i turned in uncontrollable astonishment. the aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. for an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. the next the whole frame collapsed again, and holmes had gone as quickly as he had come. “good heavens!” i cried. “how you startled me!” “every precaution is still necessary,” he whispered. “i have reason to think that they are hot upon our trail. ah, there is moriarty himself.” the train had already begun to move as holmes spoke. glancing back, i saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped. it was too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station. “with all our precautions, you see that we have cut it rather fine,” said holmes, laughing. he rose, and throwing off the black cassock and hat which had formed his disguise, he packed them away in a hand-bag. “have you seen the morning paper, watson?” “no.” “you haven’t seen about baker street, then?” “baker street?” “they set fire to our rooms last night. no great harm was done.” “good heavens, holmes! this is intolerable.” “they must have lost my track completely after their bludgeon-man was arrested. otherwise they could not have imagined that i had returned to my rooms. they have evidently taken the precaution of watching you, however, and that is what has brought moriarty to victoria. you could not have made any slip in coming?” “i did exactly what you advised.” “did you find your brougham?” “yes, it was waiting.” “did you recognise your coachman?” “no.” “it was my brother mycroft. it is an advantage to get about in such a case without taking a mercenary into your confidence. but we must plan what we are to do about moriarty now.” “as this is an express, and as the boat runs in connection with it, i should think we have shaken him off very effectively.” “my dear watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when i said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself. you do not imagine that if i were the pursuer i should allow myself to be baffled by so slight an obstacle. why, then, should you think so meanly of him?” “what will he do?” “what i should do?” “what would you do, then?” “engage a special.” “but it must be late.” “by no means. this train stops at canterbury; and there is always at least a quarter of an hour’s delay at the boat. he will catch us there.” “one would think that we were the criminals. let us have him arrested on his arrival.” “it would be to ruin the work of three months. we should get the big fish, but the smaller would dart right and left out of the net. on monday we should have them all. no, an arrest is inadmissible.” “what then?” “we shall get out at canterbury.” “and then?” “well, then we must make a cross-country journey to newhaven, and so over to dieppe. moriarty will again do what i should do. he will get on to paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days at the depôt. in the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet-bags, encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel, and make our way at our leisure into switzerland, via luxembourg and basle.” at canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to newhaven. i was still looking rather ruefully after the rapidly disappearing luggage-van which contained my wardrobe, when holmes pulled my sleeve and pointed up the line. “already, you see,” said he. far away, from among the kentish woods there rose a thin spray of smoke. a minute later a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the open curve which leads to the station. we had hardly time to take our place behind a pile of luggage when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a blast of hot air into our faces. “there he goes,” said holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock over the points. “there are limits, you see, to our friend’s intelligence. it would have been a _coup-de-maître_ had he deduced what i would deduce and acted accordingly.” “and what would he have done had he overtaken us?” “there cannot be the least doubt that he would have made a murderous attack upon me. it is, however, a game at which two may play. the question now is whether we should take a premature lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at newhaven.” we made our way to brussels that night and spent two days there, moving on upon the third day as far as strasburg. on the monday morning holmes had telegraphed to the london police, and in the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our hotel. holmes tore it open, and then with a bitter curse hurled it into the grate. “i might have known it!” he groaned. “he has escaped!” “moriarty?” “they have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. he has given them the slip. of course, when i had left the country there was no one to cope with him. but i did think that i had put the game in their hands. i think that you had better return to england, watson.” “why?” “because you will find me a dangerous companion now. this man’s occupation is gone. he is lost if he returns to london. if i read his character right he will devote his whole energies to revenging himself upon me. he said as much in our short interview, and i fancy that he meant it. i should certainly recommend you to return to your practice.” it was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend. we sat in the strasburg _salle-à-manger_ arguing the question for half an hour, but the same night we had resumed our journey and were well on our way to geneva. for a charming week we wandered up the valley of the rhone, and then, branching off at leuk, we made our way over the gemmi pass, still deep in snow, and so, by way of interlaken, to meiringen. it was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did holmes forget the shadow which lay across him. in the homely alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes, i could tell by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was well convinced that, walk where we would, we could not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging our footsteps. once, i remember, as we passed over the gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. in an instant holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. it was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the spring-time at that spot. he said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air of a man who sees the fulfillment of that which he had expected. and yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. on the contrary, i can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from professor moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion. “i think that i may go so far as to say, watson, that i have not lived wholly in vain,” he remarked. “if my record were closed to-night i could still survey it with equanimity. the air of london is the sweeter for my presence. in over a thousand cases i am not aware that i have ever used my powers upon the wrong side. of late i have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible. your memoirs will draw to an end, watson, upon the day that i crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in europe.” i shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for me to tell. it is not a subject on which i would willingly dwell, and yet i am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no detail. it was on the 3rd of may that we reached the little village of meiringen, where we put up at the englischer hof, then kept by peter steiler the elder. our landlord was an intelligent man, and spoke excellent english, having served for three years as waiter at the grosvenor hotel in london. at his advice, on the afternoon of the 4th we set off together, with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of rosenlaui. we had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls of reichenbach, which are about half-way up the hill, without making a small détour to see them. it is indeed, a fearful place. the torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. the shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. the long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. we stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss. the path has been cut half-way round the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveler has to return as he came. we had turned to do so, when we saw a swiss lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. it bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left, and was addressed to me by the landlord. it appeared that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an english lady had arrived who was in the last stage of consumption. she had wintered at davos platz, and was journeying now to join her friends at lucerne, when a sudden hemorrhage had overtaken her. it was thought that she could hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to her to see an english doctor, and, if i would only return, etc. the good steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself look upon my compliance as a very great favour, since the lady absolutely refused to see a swiss physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring a great responsibility. the appeal was one which could not be ignored. it was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. yet i had my scruples about leaving holmes. it was finally agreed, however, that he should retain the young swiss messenger with him as guide and companion while i returned to meiringen. my friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would then walk slowly over the hill to rosenlaui, where i was to rejoin him in the evening. as i turned away i saw holmes, with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of the waters. it was the last that i was ever destined to see of him in this world. when i was near the bottom of the descent i looked back. it was impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but i could see the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill and leads to it. along this a man was, i remember, walking very rapidly. i could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green behind him. i noted him, and the energy with which he walked but he passed from my mind again as i hurried on upon my errand. it may have been a little over an hour before i reached meiringen. old steiler was standing at the porch of his hotel. “well,” said i, as i came hurrying up, “i trust that she is no worse?” a look of surprise passed over his face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to lead in my breast. “you did not write this?” i said, pulling the letter from my pocket. “there is no sick englishwoman in the hotel?” “certainly not!” he cried. “but it has the hotel mark upon it! ha, it must have been written by that tall englishman who came in after you had gone. he said—” but i waited for none of the landlord’s explanations. in a tingle of fear i was already running down the village street, and making for the path which i had so lately descended. it had taken me an hour to come down. for all my efforts two more had passed before i found myself at the fall of reichenbach once more. there was holmes’s alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which i had left him. but there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that i shouted. my only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me. it was the sight of that alpine-stock which turned me cold and sick. he had not gone to rosenlaui, then. he had remained on that three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other, until his enemy had overtaken him. the young swiss had gone too. he had probably been in the pay of moriarty, and had left the two men together. and then what had happened? who was to tell us what had happened then? i stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for i was dazed with the horror of the thing. then i began to think of holmes’s own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy. it was, alas, only too easy to do. during our conversation we had not gone to the end of the path, and the alpine-stock marked the place where we had stood. the blackish soil is kept forever soft by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would leave its tread upon it. two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the farther end of the path, both leading away from me. there were none returning. a few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the branches and ferns which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. i lay upon my face and peered over with the spray spouting up all around me. it had darkened since i left, and now i could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. i shouted; but only the same half-human cry of the fall was borne back to my ears. but it was destined that i should after all have a last word of greeting from my friend and comrade. i have said that his alpine-stock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on to the path. from the top of this boulder the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and, raising my hand, i found that it came from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. as i took it up a small square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered down on to the ground. unfolding it, i found that it consisted of three pages torn from his note-book and addressed to me. it was characteristic of the man that the direction was a precise, and the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study. “my dear watson,” he said, “i write these few lines through the courtesy of mr. moriarty, who awaits my convenience for the final discussion of those questions which lie between us. he has been giving me a sketch of the methods by which he avoided the english police and kept himself informed of our movements. they certainly confirm the very high opinion which i had formed of his abilities. i am pleased to think that i shall be able to free society from any further effects of his presence, though i fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends, and especially, my dear watson, to you. i have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. indeed, if i may make a full confession to you, i was quite convinced that the letter from meiringen was a hoax, and i allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow. tell inspector patterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are in pigeonhole m., done up in a blue envelope and inscribed ‘moriarty.’ i made every disposition of my property before leaving england, and handed it to my brother mycroft. pray give my greetings to mrs. watson, and believe me to be, my dear fellow, “very sincerely yours, “sherlock holmes.” a few words may suffice to tell the little that remains. an examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other’s arms. any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. the swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom moriarty kept in his employ. as to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which holmes had accumulated exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighed upon them. of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if i have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom i shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom i have ever known.
﻿ the adventure of the empty house it was in the spring of the year 1894 that all london was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the honourable ronald adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. the public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am i allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. the crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. even now, after this long interval, i find myself thrilling as i think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses which i have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man, that they are not to blame me if i have not shared my knowledge with them, for i should have considered it my first duty to do so, had i not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month. it can be imagined that my close intimacy with sherlock holmes had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance i never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public. and i even attempted, more than once, for my own private satisfaction, to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. there was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of ronald adair. as i read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown, i realized more clearly than i had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of sherlock holmes. there were points about this strange business which would, i was sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in europe. all day, as i drove upon my round, i turned over the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. at the risk of telling a twice-told tale, i will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest. the honourable ronald adair was the second son of the earl of maynooth, at that time governor of one of the australian colonies. adair’s mother had returned from australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her son ronald, and her daughter hilda were living together at 427, park lane. the youth moved in the best society—had, so far as was known, no enemies and no particular vices. he had been engaged to miss edith woodley, of carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. for the rest, the man’s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most strange and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the night of march 30, 1894. ronald adair was fond of cards—playing continually, but never for such stakes as would hurt him. he was a member of the baldwin, the cavendish, and the bagatelle card clubs. it was shown that, after dinner on the day of his death, he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. he had also played there in the afternoon. the evidence of those who had played with him—mr. murray, sir john hardy, and colonel moran—showed that the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. his fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. he had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. it came out in evidence that, in partnership with colonel moran, he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some weeks before, from godfrey milner and lord balmoral. so much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest. on the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at ten. his mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. the servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. she had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window. no sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of lady maynooth and her daughter. desiring to say good-night, she attempted to enter her son’s room. the door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking. help was obtained, and the door forced. the unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. his head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. on the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount. there were some figures also upon a sheet of paper, with the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards. a minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex. in the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. there was the possibility that the murderer had done this, and had afterwards escaped by the window. the drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. but how did he come by his death? no one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. suppose a man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. again, park lane is a frequented thoroughfare; there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house. no one had heard a shot. and yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. such were the circumstances of the park lane mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as i have said, young adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room. all day i turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation. i confess that i made little progress. in the evening i strolled across the park, and found myself about six o’clock at the oxford street end of park lane. a group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window, directed me to the house which i had come to see. a tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom i strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen to what he said. i got as near him as i could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so i withdrew again in some disgust. as i did so i struck against an elderly, deformed man, who had been behind me, and i knocked down several books which he was carrying. i remember that as i picked them up, i observed the title of one of them, _the origin of tree worship_, and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile, who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. i endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was evident that these books which i had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. with a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and i saw his curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng. my observations of no. 427, park lane did little to clear up the problem in which i was interested. the house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. it was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it. more puzzled than ever, i retraced my steps to kensington. i had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. to my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm. “you’re surprised to see me, sir,” said he, in a strange, croaking voice. i acknowledged that i was. “well, i’ve a conscience, sir, and when i chanced to see you go into this house, as i came hobbling after you, i thought to myself, i’ll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if i was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that i am much obliged to him for picking up my books.” “you make too much of a trifle,” said i. “may i ask how you knew who i was?” “well, sir, if it isn’t too great a liberty, i am a neighbour of yours, for you’ll find my little bookshop at the corner of church street, and very happy to see you, i am sure. maybe you collect yourself, sir. here’s _british birds_, and _catullus_, and _the holy war_—a bargain, every one of them. with five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. it looks untidy, does it not, sir?” i moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. when i turned again, sherlock holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. i rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that i must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared i found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand. “my dear watson,” said the well-remembered voice, “i owe you a thousand apologies. i had no idea that you would be so affected.” i gripped him by the arms. “holmes!” i cried. “is it really you? can it indeed be that you are alive? is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?” “wait a moment,” said he. “are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things? i have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.” “i am all right, but indeed, holmes, i can hardly believe my eyes. good heavens! to think that you—you of all men—should be standing in my study.” again i gripped him by the sleeve, and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. “well, you’re not a spirit anyhow,” said i. “my dear chap, i’m overjoyed to see you. sit down, and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.” he sat opposite to me, and lit a cigarette in his old, nonchalant manner. he was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table. holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one. “i am glad to stretch myself, watson,” said he. “it is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end. now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations, we have, if i may ask for your cooperation, a hard and dangerous night’s work in front of us. perhaps it would be better if i gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished.” “i am full of curiosity. i should much prefer to hear now.” “you’ll come with me to-night?” “when you like and where you like.” “this is, indeed, like the old days. we shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go. well, then, about that chasm. i had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that i never was in it.” “you never were in it?” “no, watson, i never was in it. my note to you was absolutely genuine. i had little doubt that i had come to the end of my career when i perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late professor moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. i read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. i exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received. i left it with my cigarette-box and my stick, and i walked along the pathway, moriarty still at my heels. when i reached the end i stood at bay. he drew no weapon, but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. he knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. we tottered together upon the brink of the fall. i have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or the japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. i slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds, and clawed the air with both his hands. but for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. with my face over the brink, i saw him fall for a long way. then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.” i listened with amazement to this explanation, which holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette. “but the tracks!” i cried. “i saw, with my own eyes, that two went down the path and none returned.” “it came about in this way. the instant that the professor had disappeared, it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance fate had placed in my way. i knew that moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. there were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. they were all most dangerous men. one or other would certainly get me. on the other hand, if all the world was convinced that i was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would soon lay themselves open, and sooner or later i could destroy them. then it would be time for me to announce that i was still in the land of the living. so rapidly does the brain act that i believe i had thought this all out before professor moriarty had reached the bottom of the reichenbach fall. “i stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. in your picturesque account of the matter, which i read with great interest some months later, you assert that the wall was sheer. that was not literally true. a few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. the cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks. i might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as i have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. on the whole, then, it was best that i should risk the climb. it was not a pleasant business, watson. the fall roared beneath me. i am not a fanciful person, but i give you my word that i seemed to hear moriarty’s voice screaming at me out of the abyss. a mistake would have been fatal. more than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, i thought that i was gone. but i struggled upward, and at last i reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where i could lie unseen, in the most perfect comfort. there i was stretched, when you, my dear watson, and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death. “at last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions, you departed for the hotel, and i was left alone. i had imagined that i had reached the end of my adventures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me. a huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. for an instant i thought that it was an accident, but a moment later, looking up, i saw a man’s head against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which i was stretched, within a foot of my head. of course, the meaning of this was obvious. moriarty had not been alone. a confederate—and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was—had kept guard while the professor had attacked me. from a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend’s death and of my escape. he had waited, and then making his way round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed. “i did not take long to think about it, watson. again i saw that grim face look over the cliff, and i knew that it was the precursor of another stone. i scrambled down on to the path. i don’t think i could have done it in cold blood. it was a hundred times more difficult than getting up. but i had no time to think of the danger, for another stone sang past me as i hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. halfway down i slipped, but, by the blessing of god, i landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path. i took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness, and a week later i found myself in florence, with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me. “i had only one confidant—my brother mycroft. i owe you many apologies, my dear watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought i was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true. several times during the last three years i have taken up my pen to write to you, but always i feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret. for that reason i turned away from you this evening when you upset my books, for i was in danger at the time, and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. as to mycroft, i had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which i needed. the course of events in london did not run so well as i had hoped, for the trial of the moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. i travelled for two years in tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting lhassa, and spending some days with the head lama. you may have read of the remarkable explorations of a norwegian named sigerson, but i am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. i then passed through persia, looked in at mecca, and paid a short but interesting visit to the khalifa at khartoum the results of which i have communicated to the foreign office. returning to france, i spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which i conducted in a laboratory at montpellier, in the south of france. having concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in london, i was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable park lane mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. i came over at once to london, called in my own person at baker street, threw mrs. hudson into violent hysterics, and found that mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been. so it was, my dear watson, that at two o’clock to-day i found myself in my old armchair in my own old room, and only wishing that i could have seen my old friend watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned.” such was the remarkable narrative to which i listened on that april evening—a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which i had never thought to see again. in some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words. “work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear watson,” said he; “and i have a piece of work for us both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a man’s life on this planet.” in vain i begged him to tell me more. “you will hear and see enough before morning,” he answered. “we have three years of the past to discuss. let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house.” it was indeed like old times when, at that hour, i found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the thrill of adventure in my heart. holmes was cold and stern and silent. as the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features, i saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. i knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal london, but i was well assured, from the bearing of this master huntsman, that the adventure was a most grave one—while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest. i had imagined that we were bound for baker street, but holmes stopped the cab at the corner of cavendish square. i observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. our route was certainly a singular one. holmes’s knowledge of the byways of london was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables, the very existence of which i had never known. we emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into manchester street, and so to blandford street. here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. we entered together, and he closed it behind us. the place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty house. our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons. holmes’s cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall, until i dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door. here holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. there was no lamp near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only just discern each other’s figures within. my companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear. “do you know where we are?” he whispered. “surely that is baker street,” i answered, staring through the dim window. “exactly. we are in camden house, which stands opposite to our own old quarters.” “but why are we here?” “because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. might i trouble you, my dear watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms—the starting-point of so many of your little fairy-tales? we will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.” i crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. as my eyes fell upon it, i gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. the blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. the shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. there was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. the face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. it was a perfect reproduction of holmes. so amazed was i that i threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. he was quivering with silent laughter. “well?” said he. “good heavens!” i cried. “it is marvellous.” “i trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety,” said he, and i recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation. “it really is rather like me, is it not?” “i should be prepared to swear that it was you.” “the credit of the execution is due to monsieur oscar meunier, of grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. it is a bust in wax. the rest i arranged myself during my visit to baker street this afternoon.” “but why?” “because, my dear watson, i had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that i was there when i was really elsewhere.” “and you thought the rooms were watched?” “i _knew_ that they were watched.” “by whom?” “by my old enemies, watson. by the charming society whose leader lies in the reichenbach fall. you must remember that they knew, and only they knew, that i was still alive. sooner or later they believed that i should come back to my rooms. they watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.” “how do you know?” “because i recognized their sentinel when i glanced out of my window. he is a harmless enough fellow, parker by name, a garroter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the jew’s-harp. i cared nothing for him. but i cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom friend of moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in london. that is the man who is after me to-night watson, and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after _him_.” my friend’s plans were gradually revealing themselves. from this convenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked. that angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and we were the hunters. in silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. holmes was silent and motionless; but i could tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. it was a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. once or twice it seemed to me that i had seen the same figure before, and i especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. i tried to draw my companion’s attention to them; but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience, and continued to stare into the street. more than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. it was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. at last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. i was about to make some remark to him, when i raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. i clutched holmes’s arm, and pointed upward. “the shadow has moved!” i cried. it was indeed no longer the profile, but the back, which was turned towards us. three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own. “of course it has moved,” said he. “am i such a farcical bungler, watson, that i should erect an obvious dummy, and expect that some of the sharpest men in europe would be deceived by it? we have been in this room two hours, and mrs. hudson has made some change in that figure eight times, or once in every quarter of an hour. she works it from the front, so that her shadow may never be seen. ah!” he drew in his breath with a shrill, excited intake. in the dim light i saw his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. outside the street was absolutely deserted. those two men might still be crouching in the doorway, but i could no longer see them. all was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. again in the utter silence i heard that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. an instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and i felt his warning hand upon my lips. the fingers which clutched me were quivering. never had i known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us. but suddenly i was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. a low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the direction of baker street, but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed. a door opened and shut. an instant later steps crept down the passage—steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. holmes crouched back against the wall, and i did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. peering through the gloom, i saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. he stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. he was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and i had braced myself to meet his spring, before i realized that he had no idea of our presence. he passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. as he sank to the level of this opening, the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. the man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. his two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working convulsively. he was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. an opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. his face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. in his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. he straightened himself then, and i saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. he opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-lock. then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and i saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. i heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his foresight. for an instant he was rigid and motionless. then his finger tightened on the trigger. there was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. at that instant holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman’s back, and hurled him flat upon his face. he was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized holmes by the throat, but i struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped again upon the floor. i fell upon him, and as i held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. there was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room. “that you, lestrade?” said holmes. “yes, mr. holmes. i took the job myself. it’s good to see you back in london, sir.” “i think you want a little unofficial help. three undetected murders in one year won’t do, lestrade. but you handled the molesey mystery with less than your usual—that’s to say, you handled it fairly well.” we had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each side of him. already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. lestrade had produced two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. i was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner. it was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned towards us. with the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil. but one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading nature’s plainest danger-signals. he took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon holmes’s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended. “you fiend!” he kept on muttering. “you clever, clever fiend!” “ah, colonel!” said holmes, arranging his rumpled collar. “‘journeys end in lovers’ meetings,’ as the old play says. i don’t think i have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as i lay on the ledge above the reichenbach fall.” the colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. “you cunning, cunning fiend!” was all that he could say. “i have not introduced you yet,” said holmes. “this, gentlemen, is colonel sebastian moran, once of her majesty’s indian army, and the best heavy-game shot that our eastern empire has ever produced. i believe i am correct colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled?” the fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion. with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger himself. “i wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a _shikari_,” said holmes. “it must be very familiar to you. have you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger? this empty house is my tree, and you are my tiger. you have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you. these,” he pointed around, “are my other guns. the parallel is exact.” colonel moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the constables dragged him back. the fury upon his face was terrible to look at. “i confess that you had one small surprise for me,” said holmes. “i did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window. i had imagined you as operating from the street, where my friend, lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you. with that exception, all has gone as i expected.” colonel moran turned to the official detective. “you may or may not have just cause for arresting me,” said he, “but at least there can be no reason why i should submit to the gibes of this person. if i am in the hands of the law, let things be done in a legal way.” “well, that’s reasonable enough,” said lestrade. “nothing further you have to say, mr. holmes, before we go?” holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was examining its mechanism. “an admirable and unique weapon,” said he, “noiseless and of tremendous power: i knew von herder, the blind german mechanic, who constructed it to the order of the late professor moriarty. for years i have been aware of its existence though i have never before had the opportunity of handling it. i commend it very specially to your attention, lestrade and also the bullets which fit it.” “you can trust us to look after that, mr. holmes,” said lestrade, as the whole party moved towards the door. “anything further to say?” “only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?” “what charge, sir? why, of course, the attempted murder of mr. sherlock holmes.” “not so, lestrade. i do not propose to appear in the matter at all. to you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected. yes, lestrade, i congratulate you! with your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity, you have got him.” “got him! got whom, mr. holmes?” “the man that the whole force has been seeking in vain—colonel sebastian moran, who shot the honourable ronald adair with an expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front of no. 427, park lane, upon the thirtieth of last month. that’s the charge, lestrade. and now, watson, if you can endure the draught from a broken window, i think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement.” our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of mycroft holmes and the immediate care of mrs. hudson. as i entered i saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all in their place. there were the chemical corner and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. there upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. the diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack—even the persian slipper which contained the tobacco—all met my eyes as i glanced round me. there were two occupants of the room—one, mrs. hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered—the other, the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening’s adventures. it was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. it stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of holmes’s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect. “i hope you observed all precautions, mrs. hudson?” said holmes. “i went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.” “excellent. you carried the thing out very well. did you observe where the bullet went?” “yes, sir. i’m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. i picked it up from the carpet. here it is!” holmes held it out to me. “a soft revolver bullet, as you perceive, watson. there’s genius in that, for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun? all right, mrs. hudson. i am much obliged for your assistance. and now, watson, let me see you in your old seat once more, for there are several points which i should like to discuss with you.” he had thrown off the seedy frockcoat, and now he was the holmes of old in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy. “the old _shikari’s_ nerves have not lost their steadiness, nor his eyes their keenness,” said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust. “plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain. he was the best shot in india, and i expect that there are few better in london. have you heard the name?” “no, i have not.” “well, well, such is fame! but, then, if i remember right, you had not heard the name of professor james moriarty, who had one of the great brains of the century. just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf.” he turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar. “my collection of m’s is a fine one,” said he. “moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is morgan the poisoner, and merridew of abominable memory, and mathews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at charing cross, and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.” he handed over the book, and i read: _moran_, _sebastian_, _colonel_. unemployed. formerly 1st bangalore pioneers. born london, 1840. son of sir augustus moran, c.b., once british minister to persia. educated eton and oxford. served in jowaki campaign, afghan campaign, charasiab (despatches), sherpur, and cabul. author of _heavy game of the western himalayas_ (1881); _three months in the jungle_ (1884). address: conduit street. clubs: the anglo-indian, the tankerville, the bagatelle card club. on the margin was written, in holmes’s precise hand: the second most dangerous man in london. “this is astonishing,” said i, as i handed back the volume. “the man’s career is that of an honourable soldier.” “it is true,” holmes answered. “up to a certain point he did well. he was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in india how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. there are some trees, watson, which grow to a certain height, and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity. you will see it often in humans. i have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree. the person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family.” “it is surely rather fanciful.” “well, i don’t insist upon it. whatever the cause, colonel moran began to go wrong. without any open scandal, he still made india too hot to hold him. he retired, came to london, and again acquired an evil name. it was at this time that he was sought out by professor moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. moriarty supplied him liberally with money, and used him only in one or two very high-class jobs, which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. you may have some recollection of the death of mrs. stewart, of lauder, in 1887. not? well, i am sure moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could be proved. so cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the moriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him. you remember at that date, when i called upon you in your rooms, how i put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? no doubt you thought me fanciful. i knew exactly what i was doing, for i knew of the existence of this remarkable gun, and i knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it. when we were in switzerland he followed us with moriarty, and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the reichenbach ledge. “you may think that i read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in france, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the heels. so long as he was free in london, my life would really not have been worth living. night and day the shadow would have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come. what could i do? i could not shoot him at sight, or i should myself be in the dock. there was no use appealing to a magistrate. they cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. so i could do nothing. but i watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later i should get him. then came the death of this ronald adair. my chance had come at last. knowing what i did, was it not certain that colonel moran had done it? he had played cards with the lad, he had followed him home from the club, he had shot him through the open window. there was not a doubt of it. the bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. i came over at once. i was seen by the sentinel, who would, i knew, direct the colonel’s attention to my presence. he could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. i was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way _at once_, and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. i left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they might be needed—by the way, watson, you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy—i took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. now, my dear watson, does anything remain for me to explain?” “yes,” said i. “you have not made it clear what was colonel moran’s motive in murdering the honourable ronald adair?” “ah! my dear watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture, where the most logical mind may be at fault. each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as mine.” “you have formed one, then?” “i think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. it came out in evidence that colonel moran and young adair had, between them, won a considerable amount of money. now, moran undoubtedly played foul—of that i have long been aware. i believe that on the day of the murder adair had discovered that moran was cheating. very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club, and promised not to play cards again. it is unlikely that a youngster like adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. probably he acted as i suggest. the exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. he therefore murdered adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner’s foul play. he locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. will it pass?” “i have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.” “it will be verified or disproved at the trial. meanwhile, come what may, colonel moran will trouble us no more. the famous air-gun of von herder will embellish the scotland yard museum, and once again mr. sherlock holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of london so plentifully presents.” the adventure of the norwood builder “from the point of view of the criminal expert,” said mr. sherlock holmes, “london has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented professor moriarty.” “i can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you,” i answered. “well, well, i must not be selfish,” said he, with a smile, as he pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. “the community is certainly the gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-work specialist, whose occupation has gone. with that man in the field, one’s morning paper presented infinite possibilities. often it was only the smallest trace, watson, the faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the centre. petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage—to the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole. to the scientific student of the higher criminal world, no capital in europe offered the advantages which london then possessed. but now——” he shrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce. at the time of which i speak, holmes had been back for some months, and i at his request had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in baker street. a young doctor, named verner, had purchased my small kensington practice, and given with astonishingly little demur the highest price that i ventured to ask—an incident which only explained itself some years later, when i found that verner was a distant relation of holmes, and that it was my friend who had really found the money. our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated, for i find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case of the papers of ex-president murillo, and also the shocking affair of the dutch steamship _friesland_, which so nearly cost us both our lives. his cold and proud nature was always averse, however, from anything in the shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his successes—a prohibition which, as i have explained, has only now been removed. mr. sherlock holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with his fist. as it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, disheveled, and palpitating, burst into the room. he looked from one to the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry. “i’m sorry, mr. holmes,” he cried. “you mustn’t blame me. i am nearly mad. mr. holmes, i am the unhappy john hector mcfarlane.” he made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner, but i could see, by my companion’s unresponsive face, that it meant no more to him than to me. “have a cigarette, mr. mcfarlane,” said he, pushing his case across. “i am sure that, with your symptoms, my friend dr. watson here would prescribe a sedative. the weather has been so very warm these last few days. now, if you feel a little more composed, i should be glad if you would sit down in that chair, and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are, and what it is that you want. you mentioned your name, as if i should recognize it, but i assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a freemason, and an asthmatic, i know nothing whatever about you.” familiar as i was with my friend’s methods, it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had prompted them. our client, however, stared in amazement. “yes, i am all that, mr. holmes; and, in addition, i am the most unfortunate man at this moment in london. for heaven’s sake, don’t abandon me, mr. holmes! if they come to arrest me before i have finished my story, make them give me time, so that i may tell you the whole truth. i could go to jail happy if i knew that you were working for me outside.” “arrest you!” said holmes. “this is really most grati—most interesting. on what charge do you expect to be arrested?” “upon the charge of murdering mr. jonas oldacre, of lower norwood.” my companion’s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, i am afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction. “dear me,” said he, “it was only this moment at breakfast that i was saying to my friend, dr. watson, that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers.” our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the _daily telegraph_, which still lay upon holmes’s knee. “if you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which i have come to you this morning. i feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man’s mouth.” he turned it over to expose the central page. “here it is, and with your permission i will read it to you. listen to this, mr. holmes. the headlines are: ‘mysterious affair at lower norwood. disappearance of a well-known builder. suspicion of murder and arson. a clue to the criminal.’ that is the clue which they are already following, mr. holmes, and i know that it leads infallibly to me. i have been followed from london bridge station, and i am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. it will break my mother’s heart—it will break her heart!” he wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backward and forward in his chair. i looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence. he was flaxen-haired and handsome, in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes, and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. his age may have been about twenty-seven, his dress and bearing that of a gentleman. from the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of indorsed papers which proclaimed his profession. “we must use what time we have,” said holmes. “watson, would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read the paragraph in question?” underneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted, i read the following suggestive narrative: “late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at lower norwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. mr. jonas oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years. mr. oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in deep dene house, at the sydenham end of the road of that name. he has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. for some years he has practically withdrawn from the business, in which he is said to have massed considerable wealth. a small timber-yard still exists, however, at the back of the house, and last night, about twelve o’clock, an alarm was given that one of the stacks was on fire. the engines were soon upon the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed. up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime. surprise was expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed, which showed that he had disappeared from the house. an examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that a number of important papers were scattered about the room, and finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces of blood being found within the room, and an oaken walking-stick, which also showed stains of blood upon the handle. it is known that mr. jonas oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person, who is a young london solicitor named john hector mcfarlane, junior partner of graham and mcfarlane, of 426, gresham buildings, e.c. the police believe that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow. “later.—it is rumoured as we go to press that mr. john hector mcfarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of mr. jonas oldacre. it is at least certain that a warrant has been issued. there have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at norwood. besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it is now known that the french windows of his bedroom (which is on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire. the police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime. the conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of inspector lestrade, of scotland yard, who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.” sherlock holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together to this remarkable account. “the case has certainly some points of interest,” said he, in his languid fashion. “may i ask, in the first place, mr. mcfarlane, how it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest?” “i live at torrington lodge, blackheath, with my parents, mr. holmes, but last night, having to do business very late with mr. jonas oldacre, i stayed at an hotel in norwood, and came to my business from there. i knew nothing of this affair until i was in the train, when i read what you have just heard. i at once saw the horrible danger of my position, and i hurried to put the case into your hands. i have no doubt that i should have been arrested either at my city office or at my home. a man followed me from london bridge station, and i have no doubt—great heaven! what is that?” it was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair. a moment later, our old friend lestrade appeared in the doorway. over his shoulder i caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside. “mr. john hector mcfarlane?” said lestrade. our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face. “i arrest you for the wilful murder of mr. jonas oldacre, of lower norwood.” mcfarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed. “one moment, lestrade,” said holmes. “half an hour more or less can make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair, which might aid us in clearing it up.” “i think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,” said lestrade, grimly. “none the less, with your permission, i should be much interested to hear his account.” “well, mr. holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, and we owe you a good turn at scotland yard,” said lestrade. “at the same time i must remain with my prisoner, and i am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him.” “i wish nothing better,” said our client. “all i ask is that you should hear and recognize the absolute truth.” lestrade looked at his watch. “i’ll give you half an hour,” said he. “i must explain first,” said mcfarlane, “that i knew nothing of mr. jonas oldacre. his name was familiar to me, for many years ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. i was very much surprised therefore, when yesterday, about three o’clock in the afternoon, he walked into my office in the city. but i was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit. he had in his hand several sheets of a notebook, covered with scribbled writing—here they are—and he laid them on my table. “‘here is my will,’ said he. ‘i want you, mr. mcfarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. i will sit here while you do so.’ “i set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when i found that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me. he was a strange little ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and when i looked up at him i found his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression. i could hardly believe my own as i read the terms of the will; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation, that he had known my parents in his youth, and that he had always heard of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that his money would be in worthy hands. of course, i could only stammer out my thanks. the will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed by my clerk. this is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as i have explained, are the rough draft. mr. jonas oldacre then informed me that there were a number of documents—building leases, title-deeds, mortgages, scrip, and so forth—which it was necessary that i should see and understand. he said that his mind would not be easy until the whole thing was settled, and he begged me to come out to his house at norwood that night, bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters. ‘remember, my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until everything is settled. we will keep it as a little surprise for them.’ he was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it faithfully. “you can imagine, mr. holmes, that i was not in a humour to refuse him anything that he might ask. he was my benefactor, and all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. i sent a telegram home, therefore, to say that i had important business on hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how late i might be. mr. oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine, as he might not be home before that hour. i had some difficulty in finding his house, however, and it was nearly half-past before i reached it. i found him——” “one moment!” said holmes. “who opened the door?” “a middle-aged woman, who was, i suppose, his housekeeper.” “and it was she, i presume, who mentioned your name?” “exactly,” said mcfarlane. “pray proceed.” mcfarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative: “i was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal supper was laid out. afterwards, mr. jonas oldacre led me into his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. this he opened and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. it was between eleven and twelve when we finished. he remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper. he showed me out through his own french window, which had been open all this time.” “was the blind down?” asked holmes. “i will not be sure, but i believe that it was only half down. yes, i remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. i could not find my stick, and he said, ‘never mind, my boy, i shall see a good deal of you now, i hope, and i will keep your stick until you come back to claim it.’ i left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table. it was so late that i could not get back to blackheath, so i spent the night at the anerley arms, and i knew nothing more until i read of this horrible affair in the morning.” “anything more that you would like to ask, mr. holmes?” said lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable explanation. “not until i have been to blackheath.” “you mean to norwood,” said lestrade. “oh, yes, no doubt that is what i must have meant,” said holmes, with his enigmatical smile. lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. i saw him look curiously at my companion. “i think i should like to have a word with you presently, mr. sherlock holmes,” said he. “now, mr. mcfarlane, two of my constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.” the wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room. the officers conducted him to the cab, but lestrade remained. holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face. “there are some points about that document, lestrade, are there not?” said he, pushing them over. the official looked at them with a puzzled expression. “i can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the second page, and one or two at the end. those are as clear as print,” said he, “but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three places where i cannot read it at all.” “what do you make of that?” said holmes. “well, what do _you_ make of it?” “that it was written in a train. the good writing represents stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing passing over points. a scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points. granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an express, only stopping once between norwood and london bridge.” lestrade began to laugh. “you are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, mr. holmes,” said he. “how does this bear on the case?” “well, it corroborates the young man’s story to the extent that the will was drawn up by jonas oldacre in his journey yesterday. it is curious—is it not?—that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion. it suggests that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance. if a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective, he might do it so.” “well, he drew up his own death warrant at the same time,” said lestrade. “oh, you think so?” “don’t you?” “well, it is quite possible, but the case is not clear to me yet.” “not clear? well, if that isn’t clear, what _could_ be clearer? here is a young man who learns suddenly that, if a certain older man dies, he will succeed to a fortune. what does he do? he says nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that night. he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed, and then in the solitude of a man’s room he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile, and departs to a neighbouring hotel. the blood-stains in the room and also on the stick are very slight. it is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death—traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. is not all this obvious?” “it strikes me, my good lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious,” said holmes. “you do not add imagination to your other great qualities, but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime? would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents? again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in? and, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body, and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal? confess, lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.” “as to the stick, mr. holmes, you know as well as i do that a criminal is often flurried, and does such things, which a cool man would avoid. he was very likely afraid to go back to the room. give me another theory that would fit the facts.” “i could very easily give you half a dozen,” said holmes. “here for example, is a very possible and even probable one. i make you a free present of it. the older man is showing documents which are of evident value. a passing tramp sees them through the window, the blind of which is only half down. exit the solicitor. enter the tramp! he seizes a stick, which he observes there, kills oldacre, and departs after burning the body.” “why should the tramp burn the body?” “for the matter of that, why should mcfarlane?” “to hide some evidence.” “possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed.” “and why did the tramp take nothing?” “because they were papers that he could not negotiate.” lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was less absolutely assured than before. “well, mr. sherlock holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man. the future will show which is right. just notice this point, mr. holmes: that so far as we know, none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them, since he was heir-at-law, and would come into them in any case.” my friend seemed struck by this remark. “i don’t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory,” said he. “i only wish to point out that there are other theories possible. as you say, the future will decide. good-morning! i dare say that in the course of the day i shall drop in at norwood and see how you are getting on.” when the detective departed, my friend rose and made his preparations for the day’s work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task before him. “my first movement watson,” said he, as he bustled into his frockcoat, “must, as i said, be in the direction of blackheath.” “and why not norwood?” “because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident. the police are making the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second, because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal. but it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first incident—the curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unexpected an heir. it may do something to simplify what followed. no, my dear fellow, i don’t think you can help me. there is no prospect of danger, or i should not dream of stirring out without you. i trust that when i see you in the evening, i will be able to report that i have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster, who has thrown himself upon my protection.” it was late when my friend returned, and i could see, by a glance at his haggard and anxious face, that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled. for an hour he droned away upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. at last he flung down the instrument, and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures. “it’s all going wrong, watson—all as wrong as it can go. i kept a bold face before lestrade, but, upon my soul, i believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. all my instincts are one way, and all the facts are the other, and i much fear that british juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over lestrade’s facts.” “did you go to blackheath?” “yes, watson, i went there, and i found very quickly that the late lamented oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. the father was away in search of his son. the mother was at home—a little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. of course, she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt. but she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of oldacre. on the contrary, she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police for, of course, if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion, it would predispose him towards hatred and violence. ‘he was more like a malignant and cunning ape than a human being,’ said she, ‘and he always was, ever since he was a young man.’ “‘you knew him at that time?’ said i. “‘yes, i knew him well, in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. thank heaven that i had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better, if poorer, man. i was engaged to him, mr. holmes, when i heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and i was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that i would have nothing more to do with him.’ she rummaged in a bureau, and presently she produced a photograph of a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife. ‘that is my own photograph,’ she said. ‘he sent it to me in that state, with his curse, upon my wedding morning.’ “‘well,’ said i, ‘at least he has forgiven you now, since he has left all his property to your son.’ “‘neither my son nor i want anything from jonas oldacre, dead or alive!’ she cried, with a proper spirit. ‘there is a god in heaven, mr. holmes, and that same god who has punished that wicked man will show, in his own good time, that my son’s hands are guiltless of his blood.’ “well, i tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. i gave it up at last and off i went to norwood. “this place, deep dene house, is a big modern villa of staring brick, standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front of it. to the right and some distance back from the road was the timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. here’s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook. this window on the left is the one which opens into oldacre’s room. you can look into it from the road, you see. that is about the only bit of consolation i have had to-day. lestrade was not there, but his head constable did the honours. they had just found a great treasure-trove. they had spent the morning raking among the ashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal discs. i examined them with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. i even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of ‘hyams,’ who was oldacres tailor. i then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron. nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. all that, of course, fits in with the official theory. i crawled about the lawn with an august sun on my back, but i got up at the end of an hour no wiser than before. “well, after this fiasco i went into the bedroom and examined that also. the blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolourations, but undoubtedly fresh. the stick had been removed, but there also the marks were slight. there is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client. he admits it. footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other side. they were piling up their score all the time and we were at a standstill. “only one little gleam of hope did i get—and yet it amounted to nothing. i examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been taken out and left on the table. the papers had been made up into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. they were not, so far as i could judge, of any great value, nor did the bank-book show that mr. oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. but it seemed to me that all the papers were not there. there were allusions to some deeds—possibly the more valuable—which i could not find. this, of course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn lestrade’s argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it? “finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, i tried my luck with the housekeeper. mrs. lexington is her name—a little, dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. she could tell us something if she would—i am convinced of it. but she was as close as wax. yes, she had let mr. mcfarlane in at half-past nine. she wished her hand had withered before she had done so. she had gone to bed at half-past ten. her room was at the other end of the house, and she could hear nothing of what had passed. mr. mcfarlane had left his hat, and to the best of her belief his stick, in the hall. she had been awakened by the alarm of fire. her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered. had he any enemies? well, every man had enemies, but mr. oldacre kept himself very much to himself, and only met people in the way of business. she had seen the buttons, and was sure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night. the wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. it burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot, nothing could be seen but flames. she and all the firemen smelled the burned flesh from inside it. she knew nothing of the papers, nor of mr. oldacre’s private affairs. “so, my dear watson, there’s my report of a failure. and yet—and yet—” he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction—“i _know_ it’s all wrong. i feel it in my bones. there is something that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. there was a sort of sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge. however, there’s no good talking any more about it, watson; but unless some lucky chance comes our way i fear that the norwood disappearance case will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which i foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure.” “surely,” said i, “the man’s appearance would go far with any jury?” “that is a dangerous argument my dear watson. you remember that terrible murderer, bert stevens, who wanted us to get him off in ’87? was there ever a more mild-mannered, sunday-school young man?” “it is true.” “unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this man is lost. you can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it. by the way, there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. on looking over the bank-book i found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large checks which have been made out during the last year to mr. cornelius. i confess that i should be interested to know who this mr. cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large transactions. is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair? cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large payments. failing any other indication, my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these checks. but i fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for scotland yard.” i do not know how far sherlock holmes took any sleep that night, but when i came down to breakfast i found him pale and harassed, his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. the carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early editions of the morning papers. an open telegram lay upon the table. “what do you think of this, watson?” he asked, tossing it across. it was from norwood, and ran as follows: important fresh evidence to hand. mcfarlane’s guilt definitely established. advise you to abandon case.—lestrade. “this sounds serious,” said i. “it is lestrade’s little cock-a-doodle of victory,” holmes answered, with a bitter smile. “and yet it may be premature to abandon the case. after all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which lestrade imagines. take your breakfast, watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. i feel as if i shall need your company and your moral support today.” my friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and i have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. “at present i cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,” he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. i was not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him, and started with me for norwood. a crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round deep dene house, which was just such a suburban villa as i had pictured. within the gates lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant. “well, mr. holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? have you found your tramp?” he cried. “i have formed no conclusion whatever,” my companion answered. “but we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct, so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time, mr. holmes.” “you certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,” said holmes. lestrade laughed loudly. “you don’t like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,” said he. “a man can’t expect always to have it his own way, can he, dr. watson? step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and i think i can convince you once for all that it was john mcfarlane who did this crime.” he led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond. “this is where young mcfarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done,” said he. “now look at this.” with dramatic suddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. as he held the match nearer, i saw that it was more than a stain. it was the well-marked print of a thumb. “look at that with your magnifying glass, mr. holmes.” “yes, i am doing so.” “you are aware that no two thumb-marks are alike?” “i have heard something of the kind.” “well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young mcfarlane’s right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?” as he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain, it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb. it was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost. “that is final,” said lestrade. “yes, that is final,” i involuntarily echoed. “it is final,” said holmes. something in his tone caught my ear, and i turned to look at him. an extraordinary change had come over his face. it was writhing with inward merriment. his two eyes were shining like stars. it seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter. “dear me! dear me!” he said at last. “well, now, who would have thought it? and how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! such a nice young man to look at! it is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment, is it not, lestrade?” “yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cock-sure, mr. holmes,” said lestrade. the man’s insolence was maddening, but we could not resent it. “what a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! such a very natural action, too, if you come to think of it.” holmes was outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he spoke. “by the way, lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?” “it was the housekeeper, mrs. lexington, who drew the night constable’s attention to it.” “where was the night constable?” “he remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so as to see that nothing was touched.” “but why didn’t the police see this mark yesterday?” “well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall. besides, it’s not in a very prominent place, as you see.” “no, no—of course not. i suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?” lestrade looked at holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind. i confess that i was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation. “i don’t know whether you think that mcfarlane came out of jail in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,” said lestrade. “i leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb.” “it is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.” “there, that’s enough,” said lestrade. “i am a practical man, mr. holmes, and when i have got my evidence i come to my conclusions. if you have anything to say, you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room.” holmes had recovered his equanimity, though i still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his expression. “dear me, this is a very sad development, watson, is it not?” said he. “and yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client.” “i am delighted to hear it,” said i, heartily. “i was afraid it was all up with him.” “i would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear watson. the fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance.” “indeed, holmes! what is it?” “only this: that i _know_ that that mark was not there when i examined the hall yesterday. and now, watson, let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine.” with a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning, i accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden. holmes took each face of the house in turn, and examined it with great interest. he then led the way inside, and went over the whole building from basement to attic. most of the rooms were unfurnished, but none the less holmes inspected them all minutely. finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment. “there are really some very unique features about this case, watson,” said he. “i think it is time now that we took our friend lestrade into our confidence. he has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him, if my reading of this problem proves to be correct. yes, yes, i think i see how we should approach it.” the scotland yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when holmes interrupted him. “i understood that you were writing a report of this case,” said he. “so i am.” “don’t you think it may be a little premature? i can’t help thinking that your evidence is not complete.” lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. he laid down his pen and looked curiously at him. “what do you mean, mr. holmes?” “only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.” “can you produce him?” “i think i can.” “then do so.” “i will do my best. how many constables have you?” “there are three within call.” “excellent!” said holmes. “may i ask if they are all large, able-bodied men with powerful voices?” “i have no doubt they are, though i fail to see what their voices have to do with it.” “perhaps i can help you to see that and one or two other things as well,” said holmes. “kindly summon your men, and i will try.” five minutes later, three policemen had assembled in the hall. “in the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,” said holmes. “i will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. i think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom i require. thank you very much. i believe you have some matches in your pocket watson. now, mr. lestrade, i will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing.” as i have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside three empty bedrooms. at one end of the corridor we were all marshalled by sherlock holmes, the constables grinning and lestrade staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other across his features. holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick. “would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water? put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. now i think that we are all ready.” lestrade’s face had begun to grow red and angry. “i don’t know whether you are playing a game with us, mr. sherlock holmes,” said he. “if you know anything, you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery.” “i assure you, my good lestrade, that i have an excellent reason for everything that i do. you may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little, some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. might i ask you, watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of the straw?” i did so, and driven by the draught a coil of grey smoke swirled down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed. “now we must see if we can find this witness for you, lestrade. might i ask you all to join in the cry of ‘fire!’? now then; one, two, three——” “fire!” we all yelled. “thank you. i will trouble you once again.” “fire!” “just once more, gentlemen, and all together.” “fire!” the shout must have rung over norwood. it had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. a door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out of its burrow. “capital!” said holmes, calmly. “watson, a bucket of water over the straw. that will do! lestrade, allow me to present you with your principal missing witness, mr. jonas oldacre.” the detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement. the latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering at us and at the smouldering fire. it was an odious face—crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and white lashes. “what’s this, then?” said lestrade, at last. “what have you been doing all this time, eh?” oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red face of the angry detective. “i have done no harm.” “no harm? you have done your best to get an innocent man hanged. if it wasn’t for this gentleman here, i am not sure that you would not have succeeded.” the wretched creature began to whimper. “i am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.” “oh! a joke, was it? you won’t find the laugh on your side, i promise you. take him down, and keep him in the sitting-room until i come. mr. holmes,” he continued, when they had gone, “i could not speak before the constables, but i don’t mind saying, in the presence of dr. watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, though it is a mystery to me how you did it. you have saved an innocent man’s life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal, which would have ruined my reputation in the force.” holmes smiled, and clapped lestrade upon the shoulder. “instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced. just make a few alterations in that report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of inspector lestrade.” “and you don’t want your name to appear?” “not at all. the work is its own reward. perhaps i shall get the credit also at some distant day, when i permit my zealous historian to lay out his foolscap once more—eh, watson? well, now, let us see where this rat has been lurking.” a lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. it was lit within by slits under the eaves. a few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within, together with a number of books and papers. “there’s the advantage of being a builder,” said holmes, as we came out. “he was able to fix up his own little hiding-place without any confederate—save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom i should lose no time in adding to your bag, lestrade.” “i’ll take your advice. but how did you know of this place, mr. holmes?” “i made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. when i paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below, it was pretty clear where he was. i thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. we could, of course, have gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself. besides, i owed you a little mystification, lestrade, for your chaff in the morning.” “well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. but how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?” “the thumb-mark, lestrade. you said it was final; and so it was, in a very different sense. i knew it had not been there the day before. i pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have observed, and i had examined the hall, and was sure that the wall was clear. therefore, it had been put on during the night.” “but how?” “very simply. when those packets were sealed up, jonas oldacre got mcfarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax. it would be done so quickly and so naturally, that i daresay the young man himself has no recollection of it. very likely it just so happened, and oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it to. brooding over the case in that den of his, it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against mcfarlane by using that thumb-mark. it was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the wall during the night, either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper. if you examine among those documents which he took with him into his retreat, i will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumb-mark upon it.” “wonderful!” said lestrade. “wonderful! it’s all as clear as crystal, as you put it. but what is the object of this deep deception, mr. holmes?” it was amusing to me to see how the detective’s overbearing manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher. “well, i don’t think that is very hard to explain. a very deep, malicious, vindictive person is the gentleman who is now waiting us downstairs. you know that he was once refused by mcfarlane’s mother? you don’t! i told you that you should go to blackheath first and norwood afterwards. well, this injury, as he would consider it, has rankled in his wicked, scheming brain, and all his life he has longed for vengeance, but never seen his chance. during the last year or two, things have gone against him—secret speculation, i think—and he finds himself in a bad way. he determines to swindle his creditors, and for this purpose he pays large checks to a certain mr. cornelius, who is, i imagine, himself under another name. i have not traced these checks yet, but i have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some provincial town where oldacre from time to time led a double existence. he intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish, starting life again elsewhere.” “well, that’s likely enough.” “it would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track, and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart, if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child. it was a masterpiece of villainy, and he carried it out like a master. the idea of the will, which would give an obvious motive for the crime, the secret visit unknown to his own parents, the retention of the stick, the blood, and the animal remains and buttons in the wood-pile, all were admirable. it was a net from which it seemed to me, a few hours ago, that there was no possible escape. but he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop. he wished to improve that which was already perfect—to draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim—and so he ruined all. let us descend, lestrade. there are just one or two questions that i would ask him.” the malignant creature was seated in his own parlour, with a policeman upon each side of him. “it was a joke, my good sir—a practical joke, nothing more,” he whined incessantly. “i assure you, sir, that i simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance, and i am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that i would have allowed any harm to befall poor young mr. mcfarlane.” “that’s for a jury to decide,” said lestrade. “anyhow, we shall have you on a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder.” “and you’ll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking account of mr. cornelius,” said holmes. the little man started, and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend. “i have to thank you for a good deal,” said he. “perhaps i’ll pay my debt some day.” holmes smiled indulgently. “i fancy that, for some few years, you will find your time very fully occupied,” said he. “by the way, what was it you put into the wood-pile besides your old trousers? a dead dog, or rabbits, or what? you won’t tell? dear me, how very unkind of you! well, well, i daresay that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes. if ever you write an account, watson, you can make rabbits serve your turn.” the adventure of the dancing men holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product. his head was sunk upon his breast, and he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull grey plumage and a black top-knot. “so, watson,” said he, suddenly, “you do not propose to invest in south african securities?” i gave a start of astonishment. accustomed as i was to holmes’s curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable. “how on earth do you know that?” i asked. he wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand, and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes. “now, watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,” said he. “i am.” “i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.” “why?” “because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.” “i am sure that i shall say nothing of the kind.” “you see, my dear watson,”—he propped his test-tube in the rack, and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class—“it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. if, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one’s audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. now, it was not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did _not_ propose to invest your small capital in the gold fields.” “i see no connection.” “very likely not; but i can quickly show you a close connection. here are the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. you had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night. 2. you put chalk there when you play billiards, to steady the cue. 3. you never play billiards except with thurston. 4. you told me, four weeks ago, that thurston had an option on some south african property which would expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him. 5. your check book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key. 6. you do not propose to invest your money in this manner.” “how absurdly simple!” i cried. “quite so!” said he, a little nettled. “every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you. here is an unexplained one. see what you can make of that, friend watson.” he tossed a sheet of paper upon the table, and turned once more to his chemical analysis. i looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper. “why, holmes, it is a child’s drawing,” i cried. “oh, that’s your idea!” “what else should it be?” “that is what mr. hilton cubitt, of riding thorpe manor, norfolk, is very anxious to know. this little conundrum came by the first post, and he was to follow by the next train. there’s a ring at the bell, watson. i should not be very much surprised if this were he.” a heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of baker street. he seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air with him as he entered. having shaken hands with each of us, he was about to sit down, when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings, which i had just examined and left upon the table. “well, mr. holmes, what do you make of these?” he cried. “they told me that you were fond of queer mysteries, and i don’t think you can find a queerer one than that. i sent the paper on ahead, so that you might have time to study it before i came.” “it is certainly rather a curious production,” said holmes. “at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank. it consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn. why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object?” “i never should, mr. holmes. but my wife does. it is frightening her to death. she says nothing, but i can see terror in her eyes. that’s why i want to sift the matter to the bottom.” holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. it was a page torn from a notebook. the markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way: am-here-abe-slaney holmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he placed it in his pocketbook. “this promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,” said he. “you gave me a few particulars in your letter, mr. hilton cubitt, but i should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend, dr. watson.” “i’m not much of a story-teller,” said our visitor, nervously clasping and unclasping his great, strong hands. “you’ll just ask me anything that i don’t make clear. i’ll begin at the time of my marriage last year, but i want to say first of all that, though i’m not a rich man, my people have been at riding thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and there is no better known family in the county of norfolk. last year i came up to london for the jubilee, and i stopped at a boarding-house in russell square, because parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in it. there was an american young lady there—patrick was the name—elsie patrick. in some way we became friends, until before my month was up i was as much in love as a man could be. we were quietly married at a registry office, and we returned to norfolk a wedded couple. you’ll think it very mad, mr. holmes, that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her people, but if you saw her and knew her, it would help you to understand. “she was very straight about it, was elsie. i can’t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if i wished to do so. ‘i have had some very disagreeable associations in my life,’ said she, ‘i wish to forget all about them. i would rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me. if you take me, hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of, but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when i became yours. if these conditions are too hard, then go back to norfolk, and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.’ it was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me. i told her that i was content to take her on her own terms, and i have been as good as my word. “well we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been. but about a month ago, at the end of june, i saw for the first time signs of trouble. one day my wife received a letter from america. i saw the american stamp. she turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire. she made no allusion to it afterwards, and i made none, for a promise is a promise, but she has never known an easy hour from that moment. there is always a look of fear upon her face—a look as if she were waiting and expecting. she would do better to trust me. she would find that i was her best friend. but until she speaks, i can say nothing. mind you, she is a truthful woman, mr. holmes, and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers. i am only a simple norfolk squire, but there is not a man in england who ranks his family honour more highly than i do. she knows it well, and she knew it well before she married me. she would never bring any stain upon it—of that i am sure. “well, now i come to the queer part of my story. about a week ago—it was the tuesday of last week—i found on one of the window-sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper. they were scrawled with chalk. i thought that it was the stable-boy who had drawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. anyhow, they had come there during the night. i had them washed out, and i only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards. to my surprise, she took it very seriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. none did come for a week, and then yesterday morning i found this paper lying on the sundial in the garden. i showed it to elsie, and down she dropped in a dead faint. since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. it was then that i wrote and sent the paper to you, mr. holmes. it was not a thing that i could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you will tell me what to do. i am not a rich man, but if there is any danger threatening my little woman, i would spend my last copper to shield her.” he was a fine creature, this man of the old english soil—simple, straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face. his love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features. holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention, and now he sat for some time in silent thought. “don’t you think, mr. cubitt,” said he, at last, “that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret with you?” hilton cubitt shook his massive head. “a promise is a promise, mr. holmes. if elsie wished to tell me she would. if not, it is not for me to force her confidence. but i am justified in taking my own line—and i will.” “then i will help you with all my heart. in the first place, have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?” “no.” “i presume that it is a very quiet place. any fresh face would cause comment?” “in the immediate neighbourhood, yes. but we have several small watering-places not very far away. and the farmers take in lodgers.” “these hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. if it is a purely arbitrary one, it may be impossible for us to solve it. if, on the other hand, it is systematic, i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it. but this particular sample is so short that i can do nothing, and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation. i would suggest that you return to norfolk, that you keep a keen lookout, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear. it is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window-sill. make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood. when you have collected some fresh evidence, come to me again. that is the best advice which i can give you, mr. hilton cubitt. if there are any pressing fresh developments, i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home.” the interview left sherlock holmes very thoughtful, and several times in the next few days i saw him take his slip of paper from his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. he made no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so later. i was going out when he called me back. “you had better stay here, watson.” “why?” “because i had a wire from hilton cubitt this morning. you remember hilton cubitt, of the dancing men? he was to reach liverpool street at one-twenty. he may be here at any moment. i gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance.” we had not long to wait, for our norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him. he was looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead. “it’s getting on my nerves, this business, mr. holmes,” said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. “it’s bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you, but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure. she’s wearing away under it—just wearing away before my eyes.” “has she said anything yet?” “no, mr. holmes, she has not. and yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge. i have tried to help her, but i daresay i did it clumsily, and scared her from it. she has spoken about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour, and i always felt it was leading to the point, but somehow it turned off before we got there.” “but you have found out something for yourself?” “a good deal, mr. holmes. i have several fresh dancing-men pictures for you to examine, and, what is more important, i have seen the fellow.” “what, the man who draws them?” “yes, i saw him at his work. but i will tell you everything in order. when i got back after my visit to you, the very first thing i saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men. they had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows. i took an exact copy, and here it is.” he unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. here is a copy of the hieroglyphics: at-elriges “excellent!” said holmes. “excellent! pray continue.” “when i had taken the copy, i rubbed out the marks, but, two mornings later, a fresh inscription had appeared. i have a copy of it here:” come-elsie holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight. “our material is rapidly accumulating,” said he. “three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed under a pebble upon the sundial. here it is. the characters are, as you see, exactly the same as the last one. after that i determined to lie in wait, so i got out my revolver and i sat up in my study, which overlooks the lawn and garden. about two in the morning i was seated by the window, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when i heard steps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown. she implored me to come to bed. i told her frankly that i wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us. she answered that it was some senseless practical joke, and that i should not take any notice of it. “‘if it really annoys you, hilton, we might go and travel, you and i, and so avoid this nuisance.’ “‘what, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?’ said i. ‘why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.’ “‘well, come to bed,’ said she, ‘and we can discuss it in the morning.’ “suddenly, as she spoke, i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. something was moving in the shadow of the tool-house. i saw a dark, creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. seizing my pistol, i was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength. i tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately. at last i got clear, but by the time i had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone. he had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which i have copied on that paper. there was no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though i ran all over the grounds. and yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, for when i examined the door again in the morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which i had already seen.” “have you that fresh drawing?” “yes, it is very short, but i made a copy of it, and here it is.” again he produced a paper. the new dance was in this form: never “tell me,” said holmes—and i could see by his eyes that he was much excited—“was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate?” “it was on a different panel of the door.” “excellent! this is far the most important of all for our purpose. it fills me with hopes. now, mr. hilton cubitt, please continue your most interesting statement.” “i have nothing more to say, mr. holmes, except that i was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when i might have caught the skulking rascal. she said that she feared that i might come to harm. for an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that _he_ might come to harm, for i could not doubt that she knew who this man was, and what he meant by these strange signals. but there is a tone in my wife’s voice, mr. holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt, and i am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind. there’s the whole case, and now i want your advice as to what i ought to do. my own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.” “i fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,” said holmes. “how long can you stay in london?” “i must go back to-day. i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything. she is very nervous, and begged me to come back.” “i daresay you are right. but if you could have stopped, i might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. meanwhile you will leave me these papers, and i think that it is very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case.” sherlock holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was profoundly excited. the moment that hilton cubitt’s broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. for two hours i watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence. sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. “if my answer to this is as i hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, watson,” said he. “i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk tomorrow, and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.” i confess that i was filled with curiosity, but i was aware that holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way, so i waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence. but there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of impatience followed, during which holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell. on the evening of the second there came a letter from hilton cubitt. all was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sundial. he inclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced: elsie-prepare-to-meet-thy-god holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. his face was haggard with anxiety. “we have let this affair go far enough,” said he. “is there a train to north walsham to-night?” i turned up the time-table. the last had just gone. “then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,” said holmes. “our presence is most urgently needed. ah! here is our expected cablegram. one moment, mrs. hudson, there may be an answer. no, that is quite as i expected. this message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting hilton cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire is entangled.” so, indeed, it proved, and as i come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre, i experience once again the dismay and horror with which i was filled. would that i had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the chronicles of fact, and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made riding thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england. we had hardly alighted at north walsham, and mentioned the name of our destination, when the station-master hurried towards us. “i suppose that you are the detectives from london?” said he. a look of annoyance passed over holmes’s face. “what makes you think such a thing?” “because inspector martin from norwich has just passed through. but maybe you are the surgeons. she’s not dead—or wasn’t by last accounts. you may be in time to save her yet—though it be for the gallows.” holmes’s brow was dark with anxiety. “we are going to riding thorpe manor,” said he, “but we have heard nothing of what has passed there.” “it’s a terrible business,” said the stationmaster. “they are shot, both mr. hilton cubitt and his wife. she shot him and then herself—so the servants say. he’s dead and her life is despaired of. dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk, and one of the most honoured.” without a word holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven miles’ drive he never opened his mouth. seldom have i seen him so utterly despondent. he had been uneasy during all our journey from town, and i had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention, but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy. he leaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation. yet there was much around to interest us, for we were passing through as singular a countryside as any in england, where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on every hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia. at last the violet rim of the german ocean appeared over the green edge of the norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. “that’s riding thorpe manor,” said he. as we drove up to the porticoed front door, i observed in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations. a dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just descended from a high dog-cart. he introduced himself as inspector martin, of the norfolk constabulary, and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion. “why, mr. holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning. how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i?” “i anticipated it. i came in the hope of preventing it.” “then you must have important evidence, of which we are ignorant, for they were said to be a most united couple.” “i have only the evidence of the dancing men,” said holmes. “i will explain the matter to you later. meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent this tragedy, i am very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i possess in order to insure that justice be done. will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that i should act independently?” “i should be proud to feel that we were acting together, mr. holmes,” said the inspector, earnestly. “in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.” inspector martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the results. the local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down from mrs. hilton cubitt’s room, and he reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily fatal. the bullet had passed through the front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness. on the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself, he would not venture to express any decided opinion. certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. there was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had been emptied. mr. hilton cubitt had been shot through the heart. it was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them. “has he been moved?” asked holmes. “we have moved nothing except the lady. we could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor.” “how long have you been here, doctor?” “since four o’clock.” “anyone else?” “yes, the constable here.” “and you have touched nothing?” “nothing.” “you have acted with great discretion. who sent for you?” “the housemaid, saunders.” “was it she who gave the alarm?” “she and mrs. king, the cook.” “where are they now?” “in the kitchen, i believe.” “then i think we had better hear their story at once.” the old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a court of investigation. holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. i could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged. the trim inspector martin, the old, grey-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company. the two women told their story clearly enough. they had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed a minute later by a second one. they slept in adjoining rooms, and mrs. king had rushed in to saunders. together they had descended the stairs. the door of the study was open, and a candle was burning upon the table. their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. he was quite dead. near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against the wall. she was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red with blood. she breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything. the passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of powder. the window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. both women were positive upon the point. they had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable. then, with the aid of the groom and the stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. both she and her husband had occupied the bed. she was clad in her dress—he in his dressing-gown, over his night-clothes. nothing had been moved in the study. so far as they knew, there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife. they had always looked upon them as a very united couple. these were the main points of the servants’ evidence. in answer to inspector martin, they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. in answer to holmes, they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor. “i commend that fact very carefully to your attention,” said holmes to his professional colleague. “and now i think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room.” the study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books, and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out upon the garden. our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. his disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep. the bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in his body, after penetrating the heart. his death had certainly been instantaneous and painless. there was no powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or on his hands. according to the country surgeon, the lady had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand. “the absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may mean everything,” said holmes. “unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many shots without leaving a sign. i would suggest that mr. cubitt’s body may now be removed. i suppose, doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?” “a serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. but there are still four cartridges in the revolver. two have been fired and two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.” “so it would seem,” said holmes. “perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?” he had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window-sash, about an inch above the bottom. “by george!” cried the inspector. “how ever did you see that?” “because i looked for it.” “wonderful!” said the country doctor. “you are certainly right, sir. then a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have been present. but who could that have been, and how could he have got away?” “that is the problem which we are now about to solve,” said sherlock holmes. “you remember, inspector martin, when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder, i remarked that the point was an extremely important one?” “yes, sir; but i confess i did not quite follow you.” “it suggested that at the time of the firing, the window as well as the door of the room had been open. otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house. a draught in the room was necessary for that. both door and window were only open for a very short time, however.” “how do you prove that?” “because the candle was not guttered.” “capital!” cried the inspector. “capital!” “feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy, i conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who stood outside this opening and fired through it. any shot directed at this person might hit the sash. i looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet mark!” “but how came the window to be shut and fastened?” “the woman’s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. but, halloa! what is this?” it was a lady’s hand-bag which stood upon the study table—a trim little handbag of crocodile-skin and silver. holmes opened it and turned the contents out. there were twenty fifty-pound notes of the bank of england, held together by an india-rubber band—nothing else. “this must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial,” said holmes, as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. “it is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet, which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from inside the room. i should like to see mrs. king, the cook, again. you said, mrs. king, that you were awakened by a _loud_ explosion. when you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?” “well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, so it is hard to judge. but it did seem very loud.” “you don’t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant?” “i am sure i couldn’t say, sir.” “i believe that it was undoubtedly so. i rather think, inspector martin, that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. if you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer.” a flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it. the flowers were trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. large, masculine feet they were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. then, with a cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder. “i thought so,” said he, “the revolver had an ejector, and here is the third cartridge. i really think, inspector martin, that our case is almost complete.” the country inspector’s face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of holmes’s investigation. at first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position, but now he was overcome with admiration, and ready to follow without question wherever holmes led. “whom do you suspect?” he asked. “i’ll go into that later. there are several points in this problem which i have not been able to explain to you yet. now that i have got so far, i had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up once and for all.” “just as you wish, mr. holmes, so long as we get our man.” “i have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations. i have the threads of this affair all in my hand. even if this lady should never recover consciousness, we can still reconstruct the events of last night and insure that justice be done. first of all, i wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as ‘elrige’s’?” the servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a place. the stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off, in the direction of east ruston. “is it a lonely farm?” “very lonely, sir.” “perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night?” “maybe not, sir.” holmes thought for a little, and then a curious smile played over his face. “saddle a horse, my lad,” said he. “i shall wish you to take a note to elrige’s farm.” he took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. with these in front of him, he worked for some time at the study-table. finally he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him. i saw the outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike holmes’s usual precise hand. it was consigned to mr. abe slaney, elriges farm, east ruston, norfolk. “i think, inspector,” holmes remarked, “that you would do well to telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail. the boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. if there is an afternoon train to town, watson, i think we should do well to take it, as i have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close.” when the youth had been dispatched with the note, sherlock holmes gave his instructions to the servants. if any visitor were to call asking for mrs. hilton cubitt, no information should be given as to her condition, but he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. he impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness. finally he led the way into the drawing-room, with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us. the doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained. “i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner,” said holmes, drawing his chair up to the table, and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men. “as to you, friend watson, i owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied. to you, inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study. i must tell you, first of all, the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which mr. hilton cubitt has had with me in baker street.” he then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. “i have here in front of me these singular productions, at which one might smile, had they not proved themselves to be the forerunners of so terrible a tragedy. i am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which i analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers, but i confess that this is entirely new to me. the object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children. “having once recognized, however, that the symbols stood for letters, and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings, the solution was easy enough. the first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say, with some confidence, that the symbol xxx stood for e. as you are aware, e is the most common letter in the english alphabet, and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often. out of fifteen symbols in the first message, four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as e. it is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag, and in some cases not, but it was probable, from the way in which the flags were distributed, that they were used to break the sentence up into words. i accepted this as a hypothesis, and noted that e was represented by e “but now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. the order of the english letters after e is by no means well marked, and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence. speaking roughly, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, and l are the numerical order in which letters occur, but t, a, o, and i are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at. i therefore waited for fresh material. in my second interview with mr. hilton cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which appeared—since there was no flag—to be a single word. here are the symbols. now, in the single word i have already got the two e’s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. it might be ‘sever,’ or ‘lever,’ or ‘never.’ there can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady. accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols stand respectively for n, v, and r. n-v-r “even now i was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters. it occurred to me that if these appeals came, as i expected, from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life, a combination which contained two e’s with three letters between might very well stand for the name ‘elsie.’ on examination i found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated. it was certainly some appeal to ‘elsie.’ in this way i had got my l, s, and i. but what appeal could it be? there were only four letters in the word which preceded ‘elsie,’ and it ended in e. surely the word must be ‘come.’ i tried all other four letters ending in e, but could find none to fit the case. so now i was in possession of c, o, and m, and i was in a position to attack the first message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown. so treated, it worked out in this fashion: .m .ere ..e sl.ne. “now the first letter _can_ only be a, which is a most useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and the h is also apparent in the second word. now it becomes: am here a.e slane. or, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name: am here abe slaney. i had so many letters now that i could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion: a. elri. es. here i could only make sense by putting t and g for the missing letters, and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying.” inspector martin and i had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties. “what did you do then, sir?” asked the inspector. “i had every reason to suppose that this abe slaney was an american, since abe is an american contraction, and since a letter from america had been the starting-point of all the trouble. i had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. the lady’s allusions to her past, and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence, both pointed in that direction. i therefore cabled to my friend, wilson hargreave, of the new york police bureau, who has more than once made use of my knowledge of london crime. i asked him whether the name of abe slaney was known to him. here is his reply: ‘the most dangerous crook in chicago.’ on the very evening upon which i had his answer, hilton cubitt sent me the last message from slaney. working with known letters, it took this form: elsie .re.are to meet thy go. the addition of a p and a d completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of the crooks of chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action. i at once came to norfolk with my friend and colleague, dr. watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the worst had already occurred.” “it is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,” said the inspector, warmly. “you will excuse me, however, if i speak frankly to you. you are only answerable to yourself, but i have to answer to my superiors. if this abe slaney, living at elrige’s, is indeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while i am seated here, i should certainly get into serious trouble.” “you need not be uneasy. he will not try to escape.” “how do you know?” “to fly would be a confession of guilt.” “then let us go arrest him.” “i expect him here every instant.” “but why should he come?” “because i have written and asked him.” “but this is incredible, mr. holmes! why should he come because you have asked him? would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly?” “i think i have known how to frame the letter,” said sherlock holmes. “in fact, if i am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive.” a man was striding up the path which led to the door. he was a tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of grey flannel, with a panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked. he swaggered up the path as if the place belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the bell. “i think, gentlemen,” said holmes, quietly, “that we had best take up our position behind the door. every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow. you will need your handcuffs, inspector. you can leave the talking to me.” we waited in silence for a minute—one of those minutes which one can never forget. then the door opened and the man stepped in. in an instant holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. it was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked. he glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. then he burst into a bitter laugh. “well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. i seem to have knocked up against something hard. but i came here in answer to a letter from mrs. hilton cubitt. don’t tell me that she is in this? don’t tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?” “mrs. hilton cubitt was seriously injured, and is at death’s door.” the man gave a hoarse cry of grief, which rang through the house. “you’re crazy!” he cried, fiercely. “it was he that was hurt, not she. who would have hurt little elsie? i may have threatened her—god forgive me!—but i would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. take it back—you! say that she is not hurt!” “she was found badly wounded, by the side of her dead husband.” he sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands. for five minutes he was silent. then he raised his face once more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair. “i have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,” said he. “if i shot the man he had his shot at me, and there’s no murder in that. but if you think i could have hurt that woman, then you don’t know either me or her. i tell you, there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than i loved her. i had a right to her. she was pledged to me years ago. who was this englishman that he should come between us? i tell you that i had the first right to her, and that i was only claiming my own.” “she broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are,” said holmes, sternly. “she fled from america to avoid you, and she married an honourable gentleman in england. you dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her, in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom she feared and hated. you have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide. that is your record in this business, mr. abe slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.” “if elsie dies, i care nothing what becomes of me,” said the american. he opened one of his hands, and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm. “see here, mister,” he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes, “you’re not trying to scare me over this, are you? if the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?” he tossed it forward on to the table. “i wrote it, to bring you here.” “you wrote it? there was no one on earth outside the joint who knew the secret of the dancing men. how came you to write it?” “what one man can invent another can discover,” said holmes. “there is a cab coming to convey you to norwich, mr. slaney. but meanwhile, you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought. are you aware that mrs. hilton cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence here, and the knowledge which i happened to possess, which has saved her from the accusation? the least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for his tragic end.” “i ask nothing better,” said the american. “i guess the very best case i can make for myself is the absolute naked truth.” “it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,” cried the inspector, with the magnificent fair play of the british criminal law. slaney shrugged his shoulders. “i’ll chance that,” said he. “first of all, i want you gentlemen to understand that i have known this lady since she was a child. there were seven of us in a gang in chicago, and elsie’s father was the boss of the joint. he was a clever man, was old patrick. it was he who invented that writing, which would pass as a child’s scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it. well, elsie learned some of our ways, but she couldn’t stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to london. she had been engaged to me, and she would have married me, i believe, if i had taken over another profession, but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross. it was only after her marriage to this englishman that i was able to find out where she was. i wrote to her, but got no answer. after that i came over, and, as letters were no use, i put my messages where she could read them. “well, i have been here a month now. i lived in that farm, where i had a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the wiser. i tried all i could to coax elsie away. i knew that she read the messages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. then my temper got the better of me, and i began to threaten her. she sent me a letter then, imploring me to go away, and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband. she said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me through the end window, if i would go away afterwards and leave her in peace. she came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe me to go. this made me mad, and i caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window. at that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand. elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were face to face. i was heeled also, and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away. he fired and missed me. i pulled off almost at the same instant, and down he dropped. i made away across the garden, and as i went i heard the window shut behind me. that’s god’s truth, gentlemen, every word of it, and i heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give myself into your hands.” a cab had driven up whilst the american had been talking. two uniformed policemen sat inside. inspector martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder. “it is time for us to go.” “can i see her first?” “no, she is not conscious. mr. sherlock holmes, i only hope that if ever again i have an important case, i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.” we stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. as i turned back, my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table. it was the note with which holmes had decoyed him. “see if you can read it, watson,” said he, with a smile. it contained no word, but this little line of dancing men: come-here-at-once “if you use the code which i have explained,” said holmes, “you will find that it simply means ‘come here at once.’ i was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. and so, my dear watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil, and i think that i have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your notebook. three-forty is our train, and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner.” only one word of epilogue. the american, abe slaney, was condemned to death at the winter assizes at norwich, but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the certainty that hilton cubitt had fired the first shot. of mrs. hilton cubitt i only know that i have heard she recovered entirely, and that she still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband’s estate. the adventure of the solitary cyclist from the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive, mr. sherlock holmes was a very busy man. it is safe to say that there was no public case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years, and there were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent part. many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of continuous work. as i have preserved very full notes of all these cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them, it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which i should select to lay before the public. i shall, however, preserve my former rule, and give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution. for this reason i will now lay before the reader the facts connected with miss violet smith, the solitary cyclist of charlington, and the curious sequel of our investigation, which culminated in unexpected tragedy. it is true that the circumstance did not admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was famous, but there were some points about the case which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which i gather the material for these little narratives. on referring to my notebook for the year 1895, i find that it was upon saturday, the 23rd of april, that we first heard of miss violet smith. her visit was, i remember, extremely unwelcome to holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which john vincent harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. my friend, who loved above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. and yet, without a harshness which was foreign to his nature, it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly, who presented herself at baker street late in the evening, and implored his assistance and advice. it was vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied, for the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story, and it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so. with a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, holmes begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat, and to inform us what it was that was troubling her. “at least it cannot be your health,” said he, as his keen eyes darted over her, “so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.” she glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and i observed the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the pedal. “yes, i bicycle a good deal, mr. holmes, and that has something to do with my visit to you to-day.” my friend took the lady’s ungloved hand, and examined it with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen. “you will excuse me, i am sure. it is my business,” said he, as he dropped it. “i nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting. of course, it is obvious that it is music. you observe the spatulate finger-ends, watson, which is common to both professions? there is a spirituality about the face, however”—she gently turned it towards the light—“which the typewriter does not generate. this lady is a musician.” “yes, mr. holmes, i teach music.” “in the country, i presume, from your complexion.” “yes, sir, near farnham, on the borders of surrey.” “a beautiful neighbourhood, and full of the most interesting associations. you remember, watson, that it was near there that we took archie stamford, the forger. now, miss violet, what has happened to you, near farnham, on the borders of surrey?” the young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following curious statement: “my father is dead, mr. holmes. he was james smith, who conducted the orchestra at the old imperial theatre. my mother and i were left without a relation in the world except one uncle, ralph smith, who went to africa twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word from him since. when father died, we were left very poor, but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in _the times_, inquiring for our whereabouts. you can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone had left us a fortune. we went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper. there we met two gentlemen, mr. carruthers and mr. woodley, who were home on a visit from south africa. they said that my uncle was a friend of theirs, that he had died some months before in great poverty in johannesburg, and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations, and see that they were in no want. it seemed strange to us that uncle ralph, who took no notice of us when he was alive, should be so careful to look after us when he was dead, but mr. carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother, and so felt responsible for our fate.” “excuse me,” said holmes. “when was this interview?” “last december—four months ago.” “pray proceed.” “mr. woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. he was for ever making eyes at me—a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. i thought that he was perfectly hateful—and i was sure that cyril would not wish me to know such a person.” “oh, cyril is his name!” said holmes, smiling. the young lady blushed and laughed. “yes, mr. holmes, cyril morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope to be married at the end of the summer. dear me, how _did_ i get talking about him? what i wished to say was that mr. woodley was perfectly odious, but that mr. carruthers, who was a much older man, was more agreeable. he was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person, but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile. he inquired how we were left, and on finding that we were very poor, he suggested that i should come and teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. i said that i did not like to leave my mother, on which he suggested that i should go home to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was certainly splendid pay. so it ended by my accepting, and i went down to chiltern grange, about six miles from farnham. mr. carruthers was a widower, but he had engaged a lady housekeeper, a very respectable, elderly person, called mrs. dixon, to look after his establishment. the child was a dear, and everything promised well. mr. carruthers was very kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. every week-end i went home to my mother in town. “the first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-moustached mr. woodley. he came for a visit of a week, and oh! it seemed three months to me. he was a dreadful person—a bully to everyone else, but to me something infinitely worse. he made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth, said that if i married him i could have the finest diamonds in london, and finally, when i would have nothing to do with him, he seized me in his arms one day after dinner—he was hideously strong—and swore that he would not let me go until i had kissed him. mr. carruthers came in and tore him from me, on which he turned upon his own host, knocking him down and cutting his face open. that was the end of his visit, as you can imagine. mr. carruthers apologized to me next day, and assured me that i should never be exposed to such an insult again. i have not seen mr. woodley since. “and now, mr. holmes, i come at last to the special thing which has caused me to ask your advice to-day. you must know that every saturday forenoon i ride on my bicycle to farnham station, in order to get the 12:22 to town. the road from chiltern grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between charlington heath upon one side and the woods which lie round charlington hall upon the other. you could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a peasant, until you reach the high road near crooksbury hill. two weeks ago i was passing this place, when i chanced to look back over my shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me i saw a man, also on a bicycle. he seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. i looked back before i reached farnham, but the man was gone, so i thought no more about it. but you can imagine how surprised i was, mr. holmes, when, on my return on the monday, i saw the same man on the same stretch of road. my astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again, exactly as before, on the following saturday and monday. he always kept his distance and did not molest me in any way, but still it certainly was very odd. i mentioned it to mr. carruthers, who seemed interested in what i said, and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap, so that in future i should not pass over these lonely roads without some companion. “the horse and trap were to have come this week, but for some reason they were not delivered, and again i had to cycle to the station. that was this morning. you can think that i looked out when i came to charlington heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he had been the two weeks before. he always kept so far from me that i could not clearly see his face, but it was certainly someone whom i did not know. he was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. the only thing about his face that i could clearly see was his dark beard. to-day i was not alarmed, but i was filled with curiosity, and i determined to find out who he was and what he wanted. i slowed down my machine, but he slowed down his. then i stopped altogether, but he stopped also. then i laid a trap for him. there is a sharp turning of the road, and i pedalled very quickly round this, and then i stopped and waited. i expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. but he never appeared. then i went back and looked round the corner. i could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. to make it the more extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone.” holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. “this case certainly presents some features of its own,” said he. “how much time elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?” “two or three minutes.” “then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?” “none.” “then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other.” “it could not have been on the side of the heath, or i should have seen him.” “so, by the process of exclusion, we arrive at the fact that he made his way toward charlington hall, which, as i understand, is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road. anything else?” “nothing, mr. holmes, save that i was so perplexed that i felt i should not be happy until i had seen you and had your advice.” holmes sat in silence for some little time. “where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?” he asked at last. “he is in the midland electrical company, at coventry.” “he would not pay you a surprise visit?” “oh, mr. holmes! as if i should not know him!” “have you had any other admirers?” “several before i knew cyril.” “and since?” “there was this dreadful man, woodley, if you can call him an admirer.” “no one else?” our fair client seemed a little confused. “who was he?” asked holmes. “oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it had seemed to me sometimes that my employer, mr. carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me. we are thrown rather together. i play his accompaniments in the evening. he has never said anything. he is a perfect gentleman. but a girl always knows.” “ha!” holmes looked grave. “what does he do for a living?” “he is a rich man.” “no carriages or horses?” “well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. but he goes into the city two or three times a week. he is deeply interested in south african gold shares.” “you will let me know any fresh development, miss smith. i am very busy just now, but i will find time to make some inquiries into your case. in the meantime, take no step without letting me know. good-bye, and i trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you.” “it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl should have followers,” said holmes, as he pulled at his meditative pipe, “but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. some secretive lover, beyond all doubt. but there are curious and suggestive details about the case, watson.” “that he should appear only at that point?” “exactly. our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of charlington hall. then, again, how about the connection between carruthers and woodley, since they appear to be men of such a different type? how came they _both_ to be so keen upon looking up ralph smith’s relations? one more point. what sort of a _ménage_ is it which pays double the market price for a governess but does not keep a horse, although six miles from the station? odd, watson—very odd!” “you will go down?” “no, my dear fellow, _you_ will go down. this may be some trifling intrigue, and i cannot break my other important research for the sake of it. on monday you will arrive early at farnham; you will conceal yourself near charlington heath; you will observe these facts for yourself, and act as your own judgment advises. then, having inquired as to the occupants of the hall, you will come back to me and report. and now, watson, not another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping-stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution.” we had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the monday by the train which leaves waterloo at 9:50, so i started early and caught the 9:13. at farnham station i had no difficulty in being directed to charlington heath. it was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady’s adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees. there was a main gateway of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems, but besides this central carriage drive i observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. the house was invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay. the heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. behind one of these clumps i took up my position, so as to command both the gateway of the hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. it had been deserted when i left it, but now i saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which i had come. he was clad in a dark suit, and i saw that he had a black beard. on reaching the end of the charlington grounds, he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge, disappearing from my view. a quarter of an hour passed, and then a second cyclist appeared. this time it was the young lady coming from the station. i saw her look about her as she came to the charlington hedge. an instant later the man emerged from his hiding-place, sprang upon his cycle, and followed her. in all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures, the graceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine, and the man behind her bending low over his handle-bar with a curiously furtive suggestion in every movement. she looked back at him and slowed her pace. he slowed also. she stopped. he at once stopped, too, keeping two hundred yards behind her. her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited. she suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him. he was as quick as she, however, and darted off in desperate flight. presently she came back up the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning to take any further notice of her silent attendant. he had turned also, and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my sight. i remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that i did so, for presently the man reappeared, cycling slowly back. he turned in at the hall gates, and dismounted from his machine. for some minutes i could see him standing among the trees. his hands were raised, and he seemed to be settling his necktie. then he mounted his cycle, and rode away from me down the drive towards the hall. i ran across the heath and peered through the trees. far away i could catch glimpses of the old grey building with its bristling tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery, and i saw no more of my man. however, it seemed to me that i had done a fairly good morning’s work, and i walked back in high spirits to farnham. the local house agent could tell me nothing about charlington hall, and referred me to a well-known firm in pall mall. there i halted on my way home, and met with courtesy from the representative. no, i could not have charlington hall for the summer. i was just too late. it had been let about a month ago. mr. williamson was the name of the tenant. he was a respectable, elderly gentleman. the polite agent was afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss. mr. sherlock holmes listened with attention to the long report which i was able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that word of curt praise which i had hoped for and should have valued. on the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he commented upon the things that i had done and the things that i had not. “your hiding-place, my dear watson, was very faulty. you should have been behind the hedge, then you would have had a close view of this interesting person. as it is, you were some hundreds of yards away and can tell me even less than miss smith. she thinks she does not know the man; i am convinced she does. why, otherwise, should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features? you describe him as bending over the handle-bar. concealment again, you see. you really have done remarkably badly. he returns to the house, and you want to find out who he is. you come to a london house agent!” “what should i have done?” i cried, with some heat. “gone to the nearest public-house. that is the centre of country gossip. they would have told you every name, from the master to the scullery-maid. williamson? it conveys nothing to my mind. if he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that young lady’s athletic pursuit. what have we gained by your expedition? the knowledge that the girl’s story is true. i never doubted it. that there is a connection between the cyclist and the hall. i never doubted that either. that the hall is tenanted by williamson. who’s the better for that? well, well, my dear sir, don’t look so depressed. we can do little more until next saturday, and in the meantime i may make one or two inquiries myself.” next morning, we had a note from miss smith, recounting shortly and accurately the very incidents which i had seen, but the pith of the letter lay in the postscript: “i am sure that you will respect my confidence, mr. holmes, when i tell you that my place here has become difficult, owing to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me. i am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable. at the same time, my promise is of course given. he took my refusal very seriously, but also very gently. you can understand, however, that the situation is a little strained.” “our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters,” said holmes, thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. “the case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than i had originally thought. i should be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the country, and i am inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which i have formed.” holmes’s quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for he arrived at baker street late in the evening, with a cut lip and a discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object of a scotland yard investigation. he was immensely tickled by his own adventures and laughed heartily as he recounted them. “i get so little active exercise that it is always a treat,” said he. “you are aware that i have some proficiency in the good old british sport of boxing. occasionally, it is of service; to-day, for example, i should have come to very ignominious grief without it.” i begged him to tell me what had occurred. “i found that country pub which i had already recommended to your notice, and there i made my discreet inquiries. i was in the bar, and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that i wanted. williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the hall. there is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman, but one or two incidents of his short residence at the hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical. i have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency, and they tell me that there _was_ a man of that name in orders, whose career has been a singularly dark one. the landlord further informed me that there are usually week-end visitors—‘a warm lot, sir’—at the hall, and especially one gentleman with a red moustache, mr. woodley by name, who was always there. we had got as far as this, when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been drinking his beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole conversation. who was i? what did i want? what did i mean by asking questions? he had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. he ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which i failed to entirely avoid. the next few minutes were delicious. it was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. i emerged as you see me. mr. woodley went home in a cart. so ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my day on the surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own.” the thursday brought us another letter from our client. you will not be surprised, mr. holmes (said she), to hear that i am leaving mr. carruthers’s employment. even the high pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation. on saturday i come up to town, and i do not intend to return. mr. carruthers has got a trap, and so the dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers, are now over. as to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the strained situation with mr. carruthers, but it is the reappearance of that odious man, mr. woodley. he was always hideous, but he looks more awful than ever now, for he appears to have had an accident and he is much disfigured. i saw him out of the window, but i am glad to say i did not meet him. he had a long talk with mr. carruthers, who seemed much excited afterwards. woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood, for he did not sleep here, and yet i caught a glimpse of him again this morning, slinking about in the shrubbery. i would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place. i loathe and fear him more than i can say. how _can_ mr. carruthers endure such a creature for a moment? however, all my troubles will be over on saturday. “so i trust, watson, so i trust,” said holmes, gravely. “there is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey. i think, watson, that we must spare time to run down together on saturday morning and make sure that this curious and inclusive investigation has no untoward ending.” i confess that i had not up to now taken a very serious view of the case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous. that a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if he has so little audacity that he not only dared not address her, but even fled from her approach, he was not a very formidable assailant. the ruffian woodley was a very different person, but, except on one occasion, he had not molested our client, and now he visited the house of carruthers without intruding upon her presence. the man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end parties at the hall of which the publican had spoken, but who he was, or what he wanted, was as obscure as ever. it was the severity of holmes’s manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events. a rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the heath-covered countryside, with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse, seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and drabs and slate greys of london. holmes and i walked along the broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring. from a rise of the road on the shoulder of crooksbury hill, we could see the grim hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still younger than the building which they surrounded. holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods. far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle moving in our direction. holmes gave an exclamation of impatience. “i have given a margin of half an hour,” said he. “if that is her trap, she must be making for the earlier train. i fear, watson, that she will be past charlington before we can possibly meet her.” from the instant that we passed the rise, we could no longer see the vehicle, but we hastened onward at such a pace that my sedentary life began to tell upon me, and i was compelled to fall behind. holmes, however, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw. his springy step never slowed until suddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he halted, and i saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair. at the same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us. “too late, watson, too late!” cried holmes, as i ran panting to his side. “fool that i was not to allow for that earlier train! it’s abduction, watson—abduction! murder! heaven knows what! block the road! stop the horse! that’s right. now, jump in, and let us see if i can repair the consequences of my own blunder.” we had sprung into the dog-cart, and holmes, after turning the horse, gave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back along the road. as we turned the curve, the whole stretch of road between the hall and the heath was opened up. i grasped holmes’s arm. “that’s the man!” i gasped. a solitary cyclist was coming towards us. his head was down and his shoulders rounded, as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to the pedals. he was flying like a racer. suddenly he raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and pulled up, springing from his machine. that coal-black beard was in singular contrast to the pallor of his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had a fever. he stared at us and at the dog-cart. then a look of amazement came over his face. “halloa! stop there!” he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our road. “where did you get that dog-cart? pull up, man!” he yelled, drawing a pistol from his side pocket. “pull up, i say, or, by george, i’ll put a bullet into your horse.” holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart. “you’re the man we want to see. where is miss violet smith?” he said, in his quick, clear way. “that’s what i’m asking you. you’re in her dog-cart. you ought to know where she is.” “we met the dog-cart on the road. there was no one in it. we drove back to help the young lady.” “good lord! good lord! what shall i do?” cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair. “they’ve got her, that hell-hound woodley and the blackguard parson. come, man, come, if you really are her friend. stand by me and we’ll save her, if i have to leave my carcass in charlington wood.” he ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge. holmes followed him, and i, leaving the horse grazing beside the road, followed holmes. “this is where they came through,” said he, pointing to the marks of several feet upon the muddy path. “halloa! stop a minute! who’s this in the bush?” it was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters. he lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a terrible cut upon his head. he was insensible, but alive. a glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone. “that’s peter, the groom,” cried the stranger. “he drove her. the beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him. let him lie; we can’t do him any good, but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.” we ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. we had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when holmes pulled up. “they didn’t go to the house. here are their marks on the left—here, beside the laurel bushes. ah! i said so.” as he spoke, a woman’s shrill scream—a scream which vibrated with a frenzy of horror—burst from the thick, green clump of bushes in front of us. it ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and a gurgle. “this way! this way! they are in the bowling-alley,” cried the stranger, darting through the bushes. “ah, the cowardly dogs! follow me, gentlemen! too late! too late! by the living jingo!” we had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by ancient trees. on the farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three people. one was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. opposite her stood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs parted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding crop, his whole attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado. between them an elderly, grey-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit, had evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his prayer-book as we appeared, and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation. “they’re married!” i gasped. “come on!” cried our guide, “come on!” he rushed across the glade, holmes and i at his heels. as we approached, the lady staggered against the trunk of the tree for support. williamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed to us with mock politeness, and the bully, woodley, advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant laughter. “you can take your beard off, bob,” said he. “i know you, right enough. well, you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to mrs. woodley.” our guide’s answer was a singular one. he snatched off the dark beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous riding-crop swinging in his hand. “yes,” said our ally, “i _am_ bob carruthers, and i’ll see this woman righted, if i have to swing for it. i told you what i’d do if you molested her, and, by the lord! i’ll be as good as my word.” “you’re too late. she’s my wife.” “no, she’s your widow.” his revolver cracked, and i saw the blood spurt from the front of woodley’s waistcoat. he spun round with a scream and fell upon his back, his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor. the old man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a string of foul oaths as i have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but, before he could raise it, he was looking down the barrel of holmes’s weapon. “enough of this,” said my friend, coldly. “drop that pistol! watson, pick it up! hold it to his head. thank you. you, carruthers, give me that revolver. we’ll have no more violence. come, hand it over!” “who are you, then?” “my name is sherlock holmes.” “good lord!” “you have heard of me, i see. i will represent the official police until their arrival. here, you!” he shouted to a frightened groom, who had appeared at the edge of the glade. “come here. take this note as hard as you can ride to farnham.” he scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook. “give it to the superintendent at the police-station. until he comes, i must detain you all under my personal custody.” the strong, masterful personality of holmes dominated the tragic scene, and all were equally puppets in his hands. williamson and carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded woodley into the house, and i gave my arm to the frightened girl. the injured man was laid on his bed, and at holmes’s request i examined him. i carried my report to where he sat in the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before him. “he will live,” said i. “what!” cried carruthers, springing out of his chair. “i’ll go upstairs and finish him first. do you tell me that that angel, is to be tied to roaring jack woodley for life?” “you need not concern yourself about that,” said holmes. “there are two very good reasons why she should, under no circumstances, be his wife. in the first place, we are very safe in questioning mr. williamson’s right to solemnize a marriage.” “i have been ordained,” cried the old rascal. “and also unfrocked.” “once a clergyman, always a clergyman.” “i think not. how about the license?” “we had a license for the marriage. i have it here in my pocket.” “then you got it by trick. but, in any case a forced marriage is no marriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you will discover before you have finished. you’ll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so, unless i am mistaken. as to you, carruthers, you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.” “i begin to think so, mr. holmes, but when i thought of all the precaution i had taken to shield this girl—for i loved her, mr. holmes, and it is the only time that ever i knew what love was—it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in south africa—a man whose name is a holy terror from kimberley to johannesburg. why, mr. holmes, you’ll hardly believe it, but ever since that girl has been in my employment i never once let her go past this house, where i knew the rascals were lurking, without following her on my bicycle, just to see that she came to no harm. i kept my distance from her, and i wore a beard, so that she should not recognize me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl, and she wouldn’t have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that i was following her about the country roads.” “why didn’t you tell her of her danger?” “because then, again, she would have left me, and i couldn’t bear to face that. even if she couldn’t love me, it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house, and to hear the sound of her voice.” “well,” said i, “you call that love, mr. carruthers, but i should call it selfishness.” “maybe the two things go together. anyhow, i couldn’t let her go. besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have someone near to look after her. then, when the cable came, i knew they were bound to make a move.” “what cable?” carruthers took a telegram from his pocket. “that’s it,” said he. it was short and concise: the old man is dead. “hum!” said holmes. “i think i see how things worked, and i can understand how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. but while you wait, you might tell me what you can.” the old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language. “by heaven!” said he, “if you squeal on us, bob carruthers, i’ll serve you as you served jack woodley. you can bleat about the girl to your heart’s content, for that’s your own affair, but if you round on your pals to this plain-clothes copper, it will be the worst day’s work that ever you did.” “your reverence need not be excited,” said holmes, lighting a cigarette. “the case is clear enough against you, and all i ask is a few details for my private curiosity. however, if there’s any difficulty in your telling me, i’ll do the talking, and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets. in the first place, three of you came from south africa on this game—you williamson, you carruthers, and woodley.” “lie number one,” said the old man; “i never saw either of them until two months ago, and i have never been in africa in my life, so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it, mr. busybody holmes!” “what he says is true,” said carruthers. “well, well, two of you came over. his reverence is our own homemade article. you had known ralph smith in south africa. you had reason to believe he would not live long. you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune. how’s that—eh?” carruthers nodded and williamson swore. “she was next of kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will.” “couldn’t read or write,” said carruthers. “so you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl. the idea was that one of you was to marry her, and the other have a share of the plunder. for some reason, woodley was chosen as the husband. why was that?” “we played cards for her on the voyage. he won.” “i see. you got the young lady into your service, and there woodley was to do the courting. she recognized the drunken brute that he was, and would have nothing to do with him. meanwhile, your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady. you could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her?” “no, by george, i couldn’t!” “there was a quarrel between you. he left you in a rage, and began to make his own plans independently of you.” “it strikes me, williamson, there isn’t very much that we can tell this gentleman,” cried carruthers, with a bitter laugh. “yes, we quarreled, and he knocked me down. i am level with him on that, anyhow. then i lost sight of him. that was when he picked up with this outcast padre here. i found that they had set up housekeeping together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station. i kept my eye on her after that, for i knew there was some devilry in the wind. i saw them from time to time, for i was anxious to know what they were after. two days ago woodley came up to my house with this cable, which showed that ralph smith was dead. he asked me if i would stand by the bargain. i said i would not. he asked me if i would marry the girl myself and give him a share. i said i would willingly do so, but that she would not have me. he said, ‘let us get her married first and after a week or two she may see things a bit different.’ i said i would have nothing to do with violence. so he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that he was, and swearing that he would have her yet. she was leaving me this week-end, and i had got a trap to take her to the station, but i was so uneasy in my mind that i followed her on my bicycle. she had got a start, however, and before i could catch her, the mischief was done. the first thing i knew about it was when i saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog-cart.” holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. “i have been very obtuse, watson,” said he. “when in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery, that alone should have told me all. however, we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and, in some respects, a unique case. i perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive, and i am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them, so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently damaged by their morning’s adventures. i think, watson, that in your medical capacity, you might wait upon miss smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered, we shall be happy to escort her to her mother’s home. if she is not quite convalescent you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the midlands would probably complete the cure. as to you, mr. carruthers, i think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot. there is my card, sir, and if my evidence can be of help in your trial, it shall be at your disposal.” in the whirl of our incessant activity, it has often been difficult for me, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my narratives, and to give those final details which the curious might expect. each case has been the prelude to another, and the crisis once over, the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives. i find, however, a short note at the end of my manuscript dealing with this case, in which i have put it upon record that miss violet smith did indeed inherit a large fortune, and that she is now the wife of cyril morton, the senior partner of morton & kennedy, the famous westminster electricians. williamson and woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the former getting seven years and the latter ten. of the fate of carruthers, i have no record, but i am sure that his assault was not viewed very gravely by the court, since woodley had the reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian, and i think that a few months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice. the adventure of the priory school we have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at baker street, but i cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of thorneycroft huxtable, m.a., ph.d., etc. his card, which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic distinctions, preceded him by a few seconds, and then he entered himself—so large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was the very embodiment of self-possession and solidity. and yet his first action, when the door had closed behind him, was to stagger against the table, whence he slipped down upon the floor, and there was that majestic figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearth-rug. we had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage, which told of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life. then holmes hurried with a cushion for his head, and i with brandy for his lips. the heavy, white face was seamed with lines of trouble, the hanging pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. collar and shirt bore the grime of a long journey, and the hair bristled unkempt from the well-shaped head. it was a sorely stricken man who lay before us. “what is it, watson?” asked holmes. “absolute exhaustion—possibly mere hunger and fatigue,” said i, with my finger on the thready pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and small. “return ticket from mackleton, in the north of england,” said holmes, drawing it from the watch-pocket. “it is not twelve o’clock yet. he has certainly been an early starter.” the puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and now a pair of vacant grey eyes looked up at us. an instant later the man had scrambled on to his feet, his face crimson with shame. “forgive this weakness, mr. holmes, i have been a little overwrought. thank you, if i might have a glass of milk and a biscuit, i have no doubt that i should be better. i came personally, mr. holmes, in order to insure that you would return with me. i feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case.” “when you are quite restored——” “i am quite well again. i cannot imagine how i came to be so weak. i wish you, mr. holmes, to come to mackleton with me by the next train.” my friend shook his head. “my colleague, dr. watson, could tell you that we are very busy at present. i am retained in this case of the ferrers documents, and the abergavenny murder is coming up for trial. only a very important issue could call me from london at present.” “important!” our visitor threw up his hands. “have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the duke of holdernesse?” “what! the late cabinet minister?” “exactly. we had tried to keep it out of the papers, but there was some rumour in the _globe_ last night. i thought it might have reached your ears.” holmes shot out his long, thin arm and picked out volume “h” in his encyclopædia of reference. “‘holdernesse, 6th duke, k.g., p.c.’—half the alphabet! ‘baron beverley, earl of carston’—dear me, what a list! ‘lord lieutenant of hallamshire since 1900. married edith, daughter of sir charles appledore, 1888. heir and only child, lord saltire. owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres. minerals in lancashire and wales. address: carlton house terrace; holdernesse hall, hallamshire; carston castle, bangor, wales. lord of the admiralty, 1872; chief secretary of state for——’ well, well, this man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the crown!” “the greatest and perhaps the wealthiest. i am aware, mr. holmes, that you take a very high line in professional matters, and that you are prepared to work for the work’s sake. i may tell you, however, that his grace has already intimated that a check for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and another thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him.” “it is a princely offer,” said holmes. “watson, i think that we shall accompany dr. huxtable back to the north of england. and now, dr. huxtable, when you have consumed that milk, you will kindly tell me what has happened, when it happened, how it happened, and, finally, what dr. thorneycroft huxtable, of the priory school, near mackleton, has to do with the matter, and why he comes three days after an event—the state of your chin gives the date—to ask for my humble services.” our visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits. the light had come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks, as he set himself with great vigour and lucidity to explain the situation. “i must inform you, gentlemen, that the priory is a preparatory school, of which i am the founder and principal. _huxtable’s sidelights on horace_ may possibly recall my name to your memories. the priory is, without exception, the best and most select preparatory school in england. lord leverstoke, the earl of blackwater, sir cathcart soames—they all have intrusted their sons to me. but i felt that my school had reached its zenith when, weeks ago, the duke of holdernesse sent mr. james wilder, his secretary, with intimation that young lord saltire, ten years old, his only son and heir, was about to be committed to my charge. little did i think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my life. “on may 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer term. he was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. i may tell you—i trust that i am not indiscreet, but half-confidences are absurd in such a case—that he was not entirely happy at home. it is an open secret that the duke’s married life had not been a peaceful one, and the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent, the duchess taking up her residence in the south of france. this had occurred very shortly before, and the boy’s sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother. he moped after her departure from holdernesse hall, and it was for this reason that the duke desired to send him to my establishment. in a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy. “he was last seen on the night of may 13th—that is, the night of last monday. his room was on the second floor and was approached through another larger room, in which two boys were sleeping. these boys saw and heard nothing, so that it is certain that young saltire did not pass out that way. his window was open, and there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground. we could trace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this is the only possible exit. “his absence was discovered at seven o’clock on tuesday morning. his bed had been slept in. he had dressed himself fully, before going off, in his usual school suit of black eton jacket and dark grey trousers. there were no signs that anyone had entered the room, and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of cries or a struggle would have been heard, since caunter, the elder boy in the inner room, is a very light sleeper. “when lord saltire’s disappearance was discovered, i at once called a roll of the whole establishment—boys, masters, and servants. it was then that we ascertained that lord saltire had not been alone in his flight. heidegger, the german master, was missing. his room was on the second floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the same way as lord saltire’s. his bed had also been slept in, but he had apparently gone away partly dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor. he had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. his bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was gone. “he had been with me for two years, and came with the best references, but he was a silent, morose man, not very popular either with masters or boys. no trace could be found of the fugitives, and now, on thursday morning, we are as ignorant as we were on tuesday. inquiry was, of course, made at once at holdernesse hall. it is only a few miles away, and we imagined that, in some sudden attack of homesickness, he had gone back to his father, but nothing had been heard of him. the duke is greatly agitated, and, as to me, you have seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have reduced me. mr. holmes, if ever you put forward your full powers, i implore you to do so now, for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them.” sherlock holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the statement of the unhappy schoolmaster. his drawn brows and the deep furrow between them showed that he needed no exhortation to concentrate all his attention upon a problem which, apart from the tremendous interests involved must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the unusual. he now drew out his notebook and jotted down one or two memoranda. “you have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner,” said he, severely. “you start me on my investigation with a very serious handicap. it is inconceivable, for example, that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer.” “i am not to blame, mr. holmes. his grace was extremely desirous to avoid all public scandal. he was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world. he has a deep horror of anything of the kind.” “but there has been some official investigation?” “yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing. an apparent clue was at once obtained, since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train. only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in liverpool, and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand. then it was that in my despair and disappointment, after a sleepless night, i came straight to you by the early train.” “i suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up?” “it was entirely dropped.” “so that three days have been wasted. the affair has been most deplorably handled.” “i feel it and admit it.” “and yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution. i shall be very happy to look into it. have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this german master?” “none at all.” “was he in the master’s class?” “no, he never exchanged a word with him, so far as i know.” “that is certainly very singular. had the boy a bicycle?” “no.” “was any other bicycle missing?” “no.” “is that certain?” “quite.” “well, now, you do not mean to seriously suggest that this german rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night, bearing the boy in his arms?” “certainly not.” “then what is the theory in your mind?” “the bicycle may have been a blind. it may have been hidden somewhere, and the pair gone off on foot.” “quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not? were there other bicycles in this shed?” “several.” “would he not have hidden _a couple_, had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them?” “i suppose he would.” “of course he would. the blind theory won’t do. but the incident is an admirable starting-point for an investigation. after all, a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy. one other question. did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?” “no.” “did he get any letters?” “yes, one letter.” “from whom?” “from his father.” “do you open the boys’ letters?” “no.” “how do you know it was from the father?” “the coat of arms was on the envelope, and it was addressed in the duke’s peculiar stiff hand. besides, the duke remembers having written.” “when had he a letter before that?” “not for several days.” “had he ever one from france?” “no, never.” “you see the point of my questions, of course. either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will. in the latter case, you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing. if he has had no visitors, that prompting must have come in letters; hence i try to find out who were his correspondents.” “i fear i cannot help you much. his only correspondent, so far as i know, was his own father.” “who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance. were the relations between father and son very friendly?” “his grace is never very friendly with anyone. he is completely immersed in large public questions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions. but he was always kind to the boy in his own way.” “but the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?” “yes.” “did he say so?” “no.” “the duke, then?” “good heavens, no!” “then how could you know?” “i have had some confidential talks with mr. james wilder, his grace’s secretary. it was he who gave me the information about lord saltire’s feelings.” “i see. by the way, that last letter of the duke’s—was it found in the boy’s room after he was gone?” “no, he had taken it with him. i think, mr. holmes, it is time that we were leaving for euston.” “i will order a four-wheeler. in a quarter of an hour, we shall be at your service. if you are telegraphing home, mr. huxtable, it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in liverpool, or wherever else that red herring led your pack. in the meantime i will do a little quiet work at your own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like watson and myself may get a sniff of it.” that evening found us in the cold, bracing atmosphere of the peak country, in which dr. huxtable’s famous school is situated. it was already dark when we reached it. a card was lying on the hall table, and the butler whispered something to his master, who turned to us with agitation in every heavy feature. “the duke is here,” said he. “the duke and mr. wilder are in the study. come, gentlemen, and i will introduce you.” i was, of course, familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman, but the man himself was very different from his representation. he was a tall and stately person, scrupulously dressed, with a drawn, thin face, and a nose which was grotesquely curved and long. his complexion was of a dead pallor, which was more startling by contrast with a long, dwindling beard of vivid red, which flowed down over his white waistcoat with his watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. such was the stately presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of dr. huxtable’s hearthrug. beside him stood a very young man, whom i understood to be wilder, the private secretary. he was small, nervous, alert with intelligent light-blue eyes and mobile features. it was he who at once, in an incisive and positive tone, opened the conversation. “i called this morning, dr. huxtable, too late to prevent you from starting for london. i learned that your object was to invite mr. sherlock holmes to undertake the conduct of this case. his grace is surprised, dr. huxtable, that you should have taken such a step without consulting him.” “when i learned that the police had failed——” “his grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed.” “but surely, mr. wilder——” “you are well aware, dr. huxtable, that his grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal. he prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence.” “the matter can be easily remedied,” said the brow-beaten doctor; “mr. sherlock holmes can return to london by the morning train.” “hardly that, doctor, hardly that,” said holmes, in his blandest voice. “this northern air is invigorating and pleasant, so i propose to spend a few days upon your moors, and to occupy my mind as best i may. whether i have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is, of course, for you to decide.” i could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of indecision, from which he was rescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the red-bearded duke, which boomed out like a dinner-gong. “i agree with mr. wilder, dr. huxtable, that you would have done wisely to consult me. but since mr. holmes has already been taken into your confidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services. far from going to the inn, mr. holmes, i should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at holdernesse hall.” “i thank your grace. for the purposes of my investigation, i think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery.” “just as you like, mr. holmes. any information which mr. wilder or i can give you is, of course, at your disposal.” “it will probably be necessary for me to see you at the hall,” said holmes. “i would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?” “no, sir, i have not.” “excuse me if i allude to that which is painful to you, but i have no alternative. do you think that the duchess had anything to do with the matter?” the great minister showed perceptible hesitation. “i do not think so,” he said, at last. “the other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom. you have not had any demand of the sort?” “no, sir.” “one more question, your grace. i understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred.” “no, i wrote upon the day before.” “exactly. but he received it on that day?” “yes.” “was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?” “no, sir, certainly not.” “did you post that letter yourself?” the nobleman’s reply was interrupted by his secretary, who broke in with some heat. “his grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself,” said he. “this letter was laid with others upon the study table, and i myself put them in the post-bag.” “you are sure this one was among them?” “yes, i observed it.” “how many letters did your grace write that day?” “twenty or thirty. i have a large correspondence. but surely this is somewhat irrelevant?” “not entirely,” said holmes. “for my own part,” the duke continued, “i have advised the police to turn their attention to the south of france. i have already said that i do not believe that the duchess would encourage so monstrous an action, but the lad had the most wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this german. i think, dr. huxtable, that we will now return to the hall.” i could see that there were other questions which holmes would have wished to put, but the nobleman’s abrupt manner showed that the interview was at an end. it was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history. when the nobleman and his secretary had left, my friend flung himself at once with characteristic eagerness into the investigation. the boy’s chamber was carefully examined, and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could have escaped. the german master’s room and effects gave no further clue. in his case a trailer of ivy had given way under his weight, and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come down. that one dint in the short, green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight. sherlock holmes left the house alone, and only returned after eleven. he had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he brought into my room, where he laid it out on the bed, and, having balanced the lamp in the middle of it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of his pipe. “this case grows upon me, watson,” said he. “there are decidedly some points of interest in connection with it. in this early stage, i want you to realize those geographical features which may have a good deal to do with our investigation. holmes'-map holmes’ map of the neighbourhood of the school. “look at this map. this dark square is the priory school. i’ll put a pin in it. now, this line is the main road. you see that it runs east and west past the school, and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either way. if these two folk passed away by road, it was _this_ road.” “exactly.” “by a singular and happy chance, we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question. at this point, where my pipe is now resting, a county constable was on duty from twelve to six. it is, as you perceive, the first cross-road on the east side. this man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant, and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen. i have spoken with this policeman to-night and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person. that blocks this end. we have now to deal with the other. there is an inn here, the red bull, the landlady of which was ill. she had sent to mackleton for a doctor, but he did not arrive until morning, being absent at another case. the people at the inn were alert all night, awaiting his coming, and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road. they declare that no one passed. if their evidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west, and also to be able to say that the fugitives did _not_ use the road at all.” “but the bicycle?” i objected. “quite so. we will come to the bicycle presently. to continue our reasoning: if these people did not go by the road, they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house. that is certain. let us weigh the one against the other. on the south of the house is, as you perceive, a large district of arable land, cut up into small fields, with stone walls between them. there, i admit that a bicycle is impossible. we can dismiss the idea. we turn to the country on the north. here there lies a grove of trees, marked as the ‘ragged shaw,’ and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor, lower gill moor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upward. here, at one side of this wilderness, is holdernesse hall, ten miles by road, but only six across the moor. it is a peculiarly desolate plain. a few moor farmers have small holdings, where they rear sheep and cattle. except these, the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the chesterfield high road. there is a church there, you see, a few cottages, and an inn. beyond that the hills become precipitous. surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie.” “but the bicycle?” i persisted. “well, well!” said holmes, impatiently. “a good cyclist does not need a high road. the moor is intersected with paths, and the moon was at the full. halloa! what is this?” there was an agitated knock at the door, and an instant afterwards dr. huxtable was in the room. in his hand he held a blue cricket-cap with a white chevron on the peak. “at last we have a clue!” he cried. “thank heaven! at last we are on the dear boy’s track! it is his cap.” “where was it found?” “in the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor. they left on tuesday. to-day the police traced them down and examined their caravan. this was found.” “how do they account for it?” “they shuffled and lied—said that they found it on the moor on tuesday morning. they know where he is, the rascals! thank goodness, they are all safe under lock and key. either the fear of the law or the duke’s purse will certainly get out of them all that they know.” “so far, so good,” said holmes, when the doctor had at last left the room. “it at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the lower gill moor that we must hope for results. the police have really done nothing locally, save the arrest of these gipsies. look here, watson! there is a watercourse across the moor. you see it marked here in the map. in some parts it widens into a morass. this is particularly so in the region between holdernesse hall and the school. it is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather, but at _that_ point there is certainly a chance of some record being left. i will call you early to-morrow morning, and you and i will try if we can throw some little light upon the mystery.” the day was just breaking when i woke to find the long, thin form of holmes by my bedside. he was fully dressed, and had apparently already been out. “i have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,” said he. “i have also had a rumble through the ragged shaw. now, watson, there is cocoa ready in the next room. i must beg you to hurry, for we have a great day before us.” his eyes shone, and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration of the master workman who sees his work lie ready before him. a very different holmes, this active, alert man, from the introspective and pallid dreamer of baker street. i felt, as i looked upon that supple figure, alive with nervous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day that awaited us. and yet it opened in the blackest disappointment. with high hopes we struck across the peaty, russet moor, intersected with a thousand sheep paths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt which marked the morass between us and holdernesse. certainly, if the lad had gone homeward, he must have passed this, and he could not pass it without leaving his traces. but no sign of him or the german could be seen. with a darkening face my friend strode along the margin, eagerly observant of every muddy stain upon the mossy surface. sheep-marks there were in profusion, and at one place, some miles down, cows had left their tracks. nothing more. “check number one,” said holmes, looking gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor. “there is another morass down yonder, and a narrow neck between. halloa! halloa! halloa! what have we here?” we had come on a small black ribbon of pathway. in the middle of it, clearly marked on the sodden soil, was the track of a bicycle. “hurrah!” i cried. “we have it.” but holmes was shaking his head, and his face was puzzled and expectant rather than joyous. “a bicycle, certainly, but not _the_ bicycle,” said he. “i am familiar with forty-two different impressions left by tires. this, as you perceive, is a dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. heidegger’s tires were palmer’s, leaving longitudinal stripes. aveling, the mathematical master, was sure upon the point. therefore, it is not heidegger’s track.” “the boy’s, then?” “possibly, if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession. but this we have utterly failed to do. this track, as you perceive, was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school.” “or towards it?” “no, no, my dear watson. the more deeply sunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel, upon which the weight rests. you perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one. it was undoubtedly heading away from the school. it may or may not be connected with our inquiry, but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther.” we did so, and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the boggy portion of the moor. following the path backwards, we picked out another spot, where a spring trickled across it. here, once again, was the mark of the bicycle, though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows. after that there was no sign, but the path ran right on into ragged shaw, the wood which backed on to the school. from this wood the cycle must have emerged. holmes sat down on a boulder and rested his chin in his hands. i had smoked two cigarettes before he moved. “well, well,” said he, at last. “it is, of course, possible that a cunning man might change the tires of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks. a criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom i should be proud to do business with. we will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass again, for we have left a good deal unexplored.” we continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion of the moor, and soon our perseverance was gloriously rewarded. right across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path. holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it. an impression like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it. it was the palmer tires. “here is herr heidegger, sure enough!” cried holmes, exultantly. “my reasoning seems to have been pretty sound, watson.” “i congratulate you.” “but we have a long way still to go. kindly walk clear of the path. now let us follow the trail. i fear that it will not lead very far.” we found, however, as we advanced that this portion of the moor is intersected with soft patches, and, though we frequently lost sight of the track, we always succeeded in picking it up once more. “do you observe,” said holmes, “that the rider is now undoubtedly forcing the pace? there can be no doubt of it. look at this impression, where you get both tires clear. the one is as deep as the other. that can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handle-bar, as a man does when he is sprinting. by jove! he has had a fall.” there was a broad, irregular smudge covering some yards of the track. then there were a few footmarks, and the tire reappeared once more. “a side-slip,” i suggested. holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse. to my horror i perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. on the path, too, and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood. “bad!” said holmes. “bad! stand clear, watson! not an unnecessary footstep! what do i read here? he fell wounded—he stood up—he remounted—he proceeded. but there is no other track. cattle on this side path. he was surely not gored by a bull? impossible! but i see no traces of anyone else. we must push on, watson. surely, with stains as well as the track to guide us, he cannot escape us now.” our search was not a very long one. the tracks of the tire began to curve fantastically upon the wet and shining path. suddenly, as i looked ahead, the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick gorse-bushes. out of them we dragged a bicycle, palmer-tired, one pedal bent, and the whole front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with blood. on the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting. we ran round, and there lay the unfortunate rider. he was a tall man, full-bearded, with spectacles, one glass of which had been knocked out. the cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head, which had crushed in part of his skull. that he could have gone on after receiving such an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man. he wore shoes, but no socks, and his open coat disclosed a nightshirt beneath it. it was undoubtedly the german master. holmes turned the body over reverently, and examined it with great attention. he then sat in deep thought for a time, and i could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not, in his opinion, advanced us much in our inquiry. “it is a little difficult to know what to do, watson,” said he, at last. “my own inclinations are to push this inquiry on, for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour. on the other hand, we are bound to inform the police of the discovery, and to see that this poor fellow’s body is looked after.” “i could take a note back.” “but i need your company and assistance. wait a bit! there is a fellow cutting peat up yonder. bring him over here, and he will guide the police.” i brought the peasant across, and holmes dispatched the frightened man with a note to dr. huxtable. “now, watson,” said he, “we have picked up two clues this morning. one is the bicycle with the palmer tire, and we see what that has led to. the other is the bicycle with the patched dunlop. before we start to investigate that, let us try to realize what we _do_ know, so as to make the most of it, and to separate the essential from the accidental.” “first of all, i wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free-will. he got down from his window and he went off, either alone or with someone. that is sure.” i assented. “well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate german master. the boy was fully dressed when he fled. therefore, he foresaw what he would do. but the german went without his socks. he certainly acted on very short notice.” “undoubtedly.” “why did he go? because, from his bedroom window, he saw the flight of the boy, because he wished to overtake him and bring him back. he seized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursuing him met his death.” “so it would seem.” “now i come to the critical part of my argument. the natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him. he would know that he could overtake him. but the german does not do so. he turns to his bicycle. i am told that he was an excellent cyclist. he would not do this, if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape.” “the other bicycle.” “let us continue our reconstruction. he meets his death five miles from the school—not by a bullet, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm. the lad, then, _had_ a companion in his flight. and the flight was a swift one, since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them. yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy. what do we find? a few cattle-tracks, nothing more. i took a wide sweep round, and there is no path within fifty yards. another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder, nor were there any human foot-marks.” “holmes,” i cried, “this is impossible.” “admirable!” he said. “a most illuminating remark. it _is_ impossible as i state it, and therefore i must in some respect have stated it wrong. yet you saw for yourself. can you suggest any fallacy?” “he could not have fractured his skull in a fall?” “in a morass, watson?” “i am at my wits’ end.” “tut, tut, we have solved some worse problems. at least we have plenty of material, if we can only use it. come, then, and, having exhausted the palmer, let us see what the dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us.” we picked up the track and followed it onward for some distance, but soon the moor rose into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the watercourse behind us. no further help from tracks could be hoped for. at the spot where we saw the last of the dunlop tire it might equally have led to holdernesse hall, the stately towers of which rose some miles to our left, or to a low, grey village which lay in front of us and marked the position of the chesterfield high road. as we approached the forbidding and squalid inn, with the sign of a game-cock above the door, holmes gave a sudden groan, and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling. he had had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. with difficulty he limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe. “how are you, mr. reuben hayes?” said holmes. “who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?” the countryman answered, with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes. “well, it’s printed on the board above your head. it’s easy to see a man who is master of his own house. i suppose you haven’t such a thing as a carriage in your stables?” “no, i have not.” “i can hardly put my foot to the ground.” “don’t put it to the ground.” “but i can’t walk.” “well, then hop.” mr. reuben hayes’s manner was far from gracious, but holmes took it with admirable good-humour. “look here, my man,” said he. “this is really rather an awkward fix for me. i don’t mind how i get on.” “neither do i,” said the morose landlord. “the matter is very important. i would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle.” the landlord pricked up his ears. “where do you want to go?” “to holdernesse hall.” “pals of the dook, i suppose?” said the landlord, surveying our mud-stained garments with ironical eyes. holmes laughed good-naturedly. “he’ll be glad to see us, anyhow.” “why?” “because we bring him news of his lost son.” the landlord gave a very visible start. “what, you’re on his track?” “he has been heard of in liverpool. they expect to get him every hour.” again a swift change passed over the heavy, unshaven face. his manner was suddenly genial. “i’ve less reason to wish the dook well than most men,” said he, “for i was head coachman once, and cruel bad he treated me. it was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn-chandler. but i’m glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in liverpool, and i’ll help you to take the news to the hall.” “thank you,” said holmes. “we’ll have some food first. then you can bring round the bicycle.” “i haven’t got a bicycle.” holmes held up a sovereign. “i tell you, man, that i haven’t got one. i’ll let you have two horses as far as the hall.” “well, well,” said holmes, “we’ll talk about it when we’ve had something to eat.” when we were left alone in the stone-flagged kitchen, it was astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered. it was nearly nightfall, and we had eaten nothing since early morning, so that we spent some time over our meal. holmes was lost in thought, and once or twice he walked over to the window and stared earnestly out. it opened on to a squalid courtyard. in the far corner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work. on the other side were the stables. holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation. “by heaven, watson, i believe that i’ve got it!” he cried. “yes, yes, it must be so. watson, do you remember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?” “yes, several.” “where?” “well, everywhere. they were at the morass, and again on the path, and again near where poor heidegger met his death.” “exactly. well, now, watson, how many cows did you see on the moor?” “i don’t remember seeing any.” “strange, watson, that we should see tracks all along our line, but never a cow on the whole moor. very strange, watson, eh?” “yes, it is strange.” “now, watson, make an effort, throw your mind back. can you see those tracks upon the path?” “yes, i can.” “can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that, watson,”—he arranged a number of breadcrumbs in this fashion—: : : : :—“and sometimes like this”—: . : . : . : .—“and occasionally like this”—.・.・.・. “can you remember that?” “no, i cannot.” “but i can. i could swear to it. however, we will go back at our leisure and verify it. what a blind beetle i have been, not to draw my conclusion.” “and what is your conclusion?” “only that it is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and gallops. by george! watson, it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that. the coast seems to be clear, save for that lad in the smithy. let us slip out and see what we can see.” there were two rough-haired, unkempt horses in the tumble-down stable. holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed aloud. “old shoes, but newly shod—old shoes, but new nails. this case deserves to be a classic. let us go across to the smithy.” the lad continued his work without regarding us. i saw holmes’s eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood which was scattered about the floor. suddenly, however, we heard a step behind us, and there was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes, his swarthy features convulsed with passion. he held a short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that i was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket. “you infernal spies!” the man cried. “what are you doing there?” “why, mr. reuben hayes,” said holmes, coolly, “one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out.” the man mastered himself with a violent effort, and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh, which was more menacing than his frown. “you’re welcome to all you can find out in my smithy,” said he. “but look here, mister, i don’t care for folk poking about my place without my leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better i shall be pleased.” “all right, mr. hayes, no harm meant,” said holmes. “we have been having a look at your horses, but i think i’ll walk, after all. it’s not far, i believe.” “not more than two miles to the hall gates. that’s the road to the left.” he watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises. we did not go very far along the road, for holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us from the landlord’s view. “we were warm, as the children say, at that inn,” said he. “i seem to grow colder every step that i take away from it. no, no, i can’t possibly leave it.” “i am convinced,” said i, “that this reuben hayes knows all about it. a more self-evident villain i never saw.” “oh! he impressed you in that way, did he? there are the horses, there is the smithy. yes, it is an interesting place, this fighting cock. i think we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way.” a long, sloping hillside, dotted with grey limestone boulders, stretched behind us. we had turned off the road, and were making our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of holdernesse hall, i saw a cyclist coming swiftly along. “get down, watson!” cried holmes, with a heavy hand upon my shoulder. we had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road. amid a rolling cloud of dust, i caught a glimpse of a pale, agitated face—a face with horror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes staring wildly in front. it was like some strange caricature of the dapper james wilder whom we had seen the night before. “the duke’s secretary!” cried holmes. “come, watson, let us see what he does.” we scrambled from rock to rock, until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn. wilder’s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. no one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows. slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of holdernesse hall. then, in the gloom, we saw the two side-lamps of a trap light up in the stable-yard of the inn, and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of chesterfield. “what do you make of that, watson?” holmes whispered. “it looks like a flight.” “a single man in a dog-cart, so far as i could see. well, it certainly was not mr. james wilder, for there he is at the door.” a red square of light had sprung out of the darkness. in the middle of it was the black figure of the secretary, his head advanced, peering out into the night. it was evident that he was expecting someone. then at last there were steps in the road, a second figure was visible for an instant against the light, the door shut, and all was black once more. five minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor. “it seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the fighting cock,” said holmes. “the bar is on the other side.” “quite so. these are what one may call the private guests. now, what in the world is mr. james wilder doing in that den at this hour of night, and who is the companion who comes to meet him there? come, watson, we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely.” together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the inn. the bicycle still leaned against the wall. holmes struck a match and held it to the back wheel, and i heard him chuckle as the light fell upon a patched dunlop tire. up above us was the lighted window. “i must have a peep through that, watson. if you bend your back and support yourself upon the wall, i think that i can manage.” an instant later, his feet were on my shoulders, but he was hardly up before he was down again. “come, my friend,” said he, “our day’s work has been quite long enough. i think that we have gathered all that we can. it’s a long walk to the school, and the sooner we get started the better.” he hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the moor, nor would he enter the school when he reached it, but went on to mackleton station, whence he could send some telegrams. late at night i heard him consoling dr. huxtable, prostrated by the tragedy of his master’s death, and later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the morning. “all goes well, my friend,” said he. “i promise that before to-morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery.” at eleven o’clock next morning my friend and i were walking up the famous yew avenue of holdernesse hall. we were ushered through the magnificent elizabethan doorway and into his grace’s study. there we found mr. james wilder, demure and courtly, but with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features. “you have come to see his grace? i am sorry, but the fact is that the duke is far from well. he has been very much upset by the tragic news. we received a telegram from dr. huxtable yesterday afternoon, which told us of your discovery.” “i must see the duke, mr. wilder.” “but he is in his room.” “then i must go to his room.” “i believe he is in his bed.” “i will see him there.” holmes’s cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was useless to argue with him. “very good, mr. holmes, i will tell him that you are here.” after an hour’s delay, the great nobleman appeared. his face was more cadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before. he greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk, his red beard streaming down on the table. “well, mr. holmes?” said he. but my friend’s eyes were fixed upon the secretary, who stood by his master’s chair. “i think, your grace, that i could speak more freely in mr. wilder’s absence.” the man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at holmes. “if your grace wishes——” “yes, yes, you had better go. now, mr. holmes, what have you to say?” my friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating secretary. “the fact is, your grace,” said he, “that my colleague, dr. watson, and myself had an assurance from dr. huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case. i should like to have this confirmed from your own lips.” “certainly, mr. holmes.” “it amounted, if i am correctly informed, to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is?” “exactly.” “and another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody?” “exactly.” “under the latter heading is included, no doubt, not only those who may have taken him away, but also those who conspire to keep him in his present position?” “yes, yes,” cried the duke, impatiently. “if you do your work well, mr. sherlock holmes, you will have no reason to complain of niggardly treatment.” my friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of avidity which was a surprise to me, who knew his frugal tastes. “i fancy that i see your grace’s check-book upon the table,” said he. “i should be glad if you would make me out a check for six thousand pounds. it would be as well, perhaps, for you to cross it. the capital and counties bank, oxford street branch are my agents.” his grace sat very stern and upright in his chair and looked stonily at my friend. “is this a joke, mr. holmes? it is hardly a subject for pleasantry.” “not at all, your grace. i was never more earnest in my life.” “what do you mean, then?” “i mean that i have earned the reward. i know where your son is, and i know some, at least, of those who are holding him.” the duke’s beard had turned more aggressively red than ever against his ghastly white face. “where is he?” he gasped. “he is, or was last night, at the fighting cock inn, about two miles from your park gate.” the duke fell back in his chair. “and whom do you accuse?” sherlock holmes’s answer was an astounding one. he stepped swiftly forward and touched the duke upon the shoulder. “i accuse _you_,” said he. “and now, your grace, i’ll trouble you for that check.” never shall i forget the duke’s appearance as he sprang up and clawed with his hands, like one who is sinking into an abyss. then, with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he sat down and sank his face in his hands. it was some minutes before he spoke. “how much do you know?” he asked at last, without raising his head. “i saw you together last night.” “does anyone else beside your friend know?” “i have spoken to no one.” the duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his check-book. “i shall be as good as my word, mr. holmes. i am about to write your check, however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me. when the offer was first made, i little thought the turn which events might take. but you and your friend are men of discretion, mr. holmes?” “i hardly understand your grace.” “i must put it plainly, mr. holmes. if only you two know of this incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. i think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that i owe you, is it not?” but holmes smiled and shook his head. “i fear, your grace, that matters can hardly be arranged so easily. there is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for.” “but james knew nothing of that. you cannot hold him responsible for that. it was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ.” “i must take the view, your grace, that when a man embarks upon a crime, he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it.” “morally, mr. holmes. no doubt you are right. but surely not in the eyes of the law. a man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present, and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do. the instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me, so filled was he with horror and remorse. he lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer. oh, mr. holmes, you must save him—you must save him! i tell you that you must save him!” the duke had dropped the last attempt at self-command, and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands raving in the air. at last he mastered himself and sat down once more at his desk. “i appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else,” said he. “at least, we may take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal.” “exactly,” said holmes. “i think, your grace, that this can only be done by absolute frankness between us. i am disposed to help your grace to the best of my ability, but, in order to do so, i must understand to the last detail how the matter stands. i realize that your words applied to mr. james wilder, and that he is not the murderer.” “no, the murderer has escaped.” sherlock holmes smiled demurely. “your grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which i possess, or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me. mr. reuben hayes was arrested at chesterfield, on my information, at eleven o’clock last night. i had a telegram from the head of the local police before i left the school this morning.” the duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my friend. “you seem to have powers that are hardly human,” said he. “so reuben hayes is taken? i am right glad to hear it, if it will not react upon the fate of james.” “your secretary?” “no, sir, my son.” it was holmes’s turn to look astonished. “i confess that this is entirely new to me, your grace. i must beg you to be more explicit.” “i will conceal nothing from you. i agree with you that complete frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this desperate situation to which james’s folly and jealousy have reduced us. when i was a very young man, mr. holmes, i loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime. i offered the lady marriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career. had she lived, i would certainly never have married anyone else. she died, and left this one child, whom for her sake i have cherished and cared for. i could not acknowledge the paternity to the world, but i gave him the best of educations, and since he came to manhood i have kept him near my person. he surmised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the claim which he has upon me, and upon his power of provoking a scandal which would be abhorrent to me. his presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage. above all, he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. you may well ask me why, under these circumstances, i still kept james under my roof. i answer that it was because i could see his mother’s face in his, and that for her dear sake there was no end to my long-suffering. all her pretty ways too—there was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory. i _could_ not send him away. but i feared so much lest he should do arthur—that is, lord saltire—a mischief, that i dispatched him for safety to dr. huxtable’s school. “james came into contact with this fellow hayes, because the man was a tenant of mine, and james acted as agent. the fellow was a rascal from the beginning, but, in some extraordinary way, james became intimate with him. he had always a taste for low company. when james determined to kidnap lord saltire, it was of this man’s service that he availed himself. you remember that i wrote to arthur upon that last day. well, james opened the letter and inserted a note asking arthur to meet him in a little wood called the ragged shaw, which is near to the school. he used the duchess’s name, and in that way got the boy to come. that evening james bicycled over—i am telling you what he has himself confessed to me—and he told arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his mother longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse, who would take him to her. poor arthur fell into the trap. he came to the appointment, and found this fellow hayes with a led pony. arthur mounted, and they set off together. it appears—though this james only heard yesterday—that they were pursued, that hayes struck the pursuer with his stick, and that the man died of his injuries. hayes brought arthur to his public-house, the fighting cock, where he was confined in an upper room, under the care of mrs. hayes, who is a kindly woman, but entirely under the control of her brutal husband. “well, mr. holmes, that was the state of affairs when i first saw you two days ago. i had no more idea of the truth than you. you will ask me what was james’s motive in doing such a deed. i answer that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir. in his view he should himself have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible. at the same time, he had a definite motive also. he was eager that i should break the entail, and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so. he intended to make a bargain with me—to restore arthur if i would break the entail, and so make it possible for the estate to be left to him by will. he knew well that i should never willingly invoke the aid of the police against him. i say that he would have proposed such a bargain to me, but he did not actually do so, for events moved too quickly for him, and he had not time to put his plans into practice. “what brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man heidegger’s dead body. james was seized with horror at the news. it came to us yesterday, as we sat together in this study. dr. huxtable had sent a telegram. james was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions, which had never been entirely absent, rose instantly to a certainty, and i taxed him with the deed. he made a complete voluntary confession. then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer, so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life. i yielded—as i have always yielded—to his prayers, and instantly james hurried off to the fighting cock to warn hayes and give him the means of flight. i could not go there by daylight without provoking comment, but as soon as night fell i hurried off to see my dear arthur. i found him safe and well, but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed. in deference to my promise, and much against my will, i consented to leave him there for three days, under the charge of mrs. hayes, since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer, and i could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate james. you asked for frankness, mr. holmes, and i have taken you at your word, for i have now told you everything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment. do you in turn be as frank with me.” “i will,” said holmes. “in the first place, your grace, i am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law. you have condoned a felony, and you have aided the escape of a murderer, for i cannot doubt that any money which was taken by james wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your grace’s purse.” the duke bowed his assent. “this is, indeed, a most serious matter. even more culpable in my opinion, your grace, is your attitude towards your younger son. you leave him in this den for three days.” “under solemn promises——” “what are promises to such people as these? you have no guarantee that he will not be spirited away again. to humour your guilty elder son, you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary danger. it was a most unjustifiable action.” the proud lord of holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated in his own ducal hall. the blood flushed into his high forehead, but his conscience held him dumb. “i will help you, but on one condition only. it is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as i like.” without a word, the duke pressed the electric bell. a servant entered. “you will be glad to hear,” said holmes, “that your young master is found. it is the duke’s desire that the carriage shall go at once to the fighting cock inn to bring lord saltire home. “now,” said holmes, when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared, “having secured the future, we can afford to be more lenient with the past. i am not in an official position, and there is no reason, so long as the ends of justice are served, why i should disclose all that i know. as to hayes, i say nothing. the gallows awaits him, and i would do nothing to save him from it. what he will divulge i cannot tell, but i have no doubt that your grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent. from the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom. if they do not themselves find it out, i see no reason why i should prompt them to take a broader point of view. i would warn your grace, however, that the continued presence of mr. james wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune.” “i understand that, mr. holmes, and it is already settled that he shall leave me forever, and go to seek his fortune in australia.” “in that case, your grace, since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence, i would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the duchess, and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted.” “that also i have arranged, mr. holmes. i wrote to the duchess this morning.” “in that case,” said holmes, rising, “i think that my friend and i can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the north. there is one other small point upon which i desire some light. this fellow hayes had shod his horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows. was it from mr. wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device?” the duke stood in thought for a moment, with a look of intense surprise on his face. then he opened a door and showed us into a large room furnished as a museum. he led the way to a glass case in a corner, and pointed to the inscription. “these shoes,” it ran, “were dug up in the moat of holdernesse hall. they are for the use of horses, but they are shaped below with a cloven foot of iron, so as to throw pursuers off the track. they are supposed to have belonged to some of the marauding barons of holdernesse in the middle ages.” holmes opened the case, and moistening his finger he passed it along the shoe. a thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin. “thank you,” said he, as he replaced the glass. “it is the second most interesting object that i have seen in the north.” “and the first?” holmes folded up his check and placed it carefully in his notebook. “i am a poor man,” said he, as he patted it affectionately, and thrust it into the depths of his inner pocket. the adventure of black peter i have never known my friend to be in better form, both mental and physical, than in the year ’95. his increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice, and i should be guilty of an indiscretion if i were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in baker street. holmes, however, like all great artists, lived for his art’s sake, and, save in the case of the duke of holdernesse, i have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable services. so unworldly was he—or so capricious—that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity. in this memorable year ’95, a curious and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention, ranging from his famous investigation of the sudden death of cardinal tosca—an inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of his holiness the pope—down to his arrest of wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the east end of london. close on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of woodman’s lee, and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of captain peter carey. no record of the doings of mr. sherlock holmes would be complete which did not include some account of this very unusual affair. during the first week of july, my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that i knew he had something on hand. the fact that several rough-looking men called during that time and inquired for captain basil made me understand that holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity. he had at least five small refuges in different parts of london, in which he was able to change his personality. he said nothing of his business to me, and it was not my habit to force a confidence. the first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. he had gone out before breakfast, and i had sat down to mine when he strode into the room, his hat upon his head and a huge barbed-headed spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm. “good gracious, holmes!” i cried. “you don’t mean to say that you have been walking about london with that thing?” “i drove to the butcher’s and back.” “the butcher’s?” “and i return with an excellent appetite. there can be no question, my dear watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast. but i am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken.” “i will not attempt it.” he chuckled as he poured out the coffee. “if you could have looked into allardyce’s back shop, you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon. i was that energetic person, and i have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can i transfix the pig with a single blow. perhaps you would care to try?” “not for worlds. but why were you doing this?” “because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of woodman’s lee. ah, hopkins, i got your wire last night, and i have been expecting you. come and join us.” our visitor was an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed in a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform. i recognized him at once as stanley hopkins, a young police inspector, for whose future holmes had high hopes, while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur. hopkins’s brow was clouded, and he sat down with an air of deep dejection. “no, thank you, sir. i breakfasted before i came round. i spent the night in town, for i came up yesterday to report.” “and what had you to report?” “failure, sir, absolute failure.” “you have made no progress?” “none.” “dear me! i must have a look at the matter.” “i wish to heavens that you would, mr. holmes. it’s my first big chance, and i am at my wits’ end. for goodness’ sake, come down and lend me a hand.” “well, well, it just happens that i have already read all the available evidence, including the report of the inquest, with some care. by the way, what do you make of that tobacco pouch, found on the scene of the crime? is there no clue there?” hopkins looked surprised. “it was the man’s own pouch, sir. his initials were inside it. and it was of sealskin,—and he was an old sealer.” “but he had no pipe.” “no, sir, we could find no pipe. indeed, he smoked very little, and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends.” “no doubt. i only mention it because, if i had been handling the case, i should have been inclined to make that the starting-point of my investigation. however, my friend, dr. watson, knows nothing of this matter, and i should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more. just give us some short sketches of the essentials.” stanley hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket. “i have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man, captain peter carey. he was born in ’45—fifty years of age. he was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher. in 1883 he commanded the steam sealer _sea unicorn_, of dundee. he had then had several successful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he retired. after that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought a small place called woodman’s lee, near forest row, in sussex. there he has lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day. “there were some most singular points about the man. in ordinary life, he was a strict puritan—a silent, gloomy fellow. his household consisted of his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two female servants. these last were continually changing, for it was never a very cheery situation, and sometimes it became past all bearing. the man was an intermittent drunkard, and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend. he has been known to drive his wife and daughter out of doors in the middle of the night and flog them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams. “he was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar, who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct. in short, mr. holmes, you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than peter carey, and i have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship. he was known in the trade as black peter, and the name was given him, not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard, but for the humours which were the terror of all around him. i need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours, and that i have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end. “you must have read in the account of the inquest about the man’s cabin, mr. holmes, but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it. he had built himself a wooden outhouse—he always called it the ‘cabin’—a few hundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night. it was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. he kept the key in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold. there are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains and never opened. one of these windows was turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what black peter was doing in there. that’s the window, mr. holmes, which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest. “you remember that a stonemason, named slater, walking from forest row about one o’clock in the morning—two days before the murder—stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees. he swears that the shadow of a man’s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that of peter carey, whom he knew well. it was that of a bearded man, but the beard was short and bristled forward in a way very different from that of the captain. so he says, but he had been two hours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the window. besides, this refers to the monday, and the crime was done upon the wednesday. “on the tuesday, peter carey was in one of his blackest moods, flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast. he roamed about the house, and the women ran for it when they heard him coming. late in the evening, he went down to his own hut. about two o’clock the following morning, his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most fearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken. on rising at seven, one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open, but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him. peeping into the open door, they saw a sight which sent them flying, with white faces, into the village. within an hour, i was on the spot and had taken over the case. “well, i have fairly steady nerves, as you know, mr. holmes, but i give you my word, that i got a shake when i put my head into that little house. it was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles, and the floor and walls were like a slaughter-house. he had called it a cabin, and a cabin it was, sure enough, for you would have thought that you were in a ship. there was a bunk at one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture of the _sea unicorn_, a line of logbooks on a shelf, all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain’s room. and there, in the middle of it, was the man himself—his face twisted like a lost soul in torment, and his great brindled beard stuck upward in his agony. right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him. he was pinned like a beetle on a card. of course, he was quite dead, and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony. “i know your methods, sir, and i applied them. before i permitted anything to be moved, i examined most carefully the ground outside, and also the floor of the room. there were no footmarks.” “meaning that you saw none?” “i assure you, sir, that there were none.” “my good hopkins, i have investigated many crimes, but i have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. as long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher. it is incredible that this blood-bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us. i understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?” the young inspector winced at my companion’s ironical comments. “i was a fool not to call you in at the time mr. holmes. however, that’s past praying for now. yes, there were several objects in the room which called for special attention. one was the harpoon with which the deed was committed. it had been snatched down from a rack on the wall. two others remained there, and there was a vacant place for the third. on the stock was engraved ‘ss. _sea unicorn_, dundee.’ this seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. the fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet peter carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer, which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table.” “yes,” said holmes; “i think that both inferences are permissible. was there any other spirit but rum in the room?” “yes, there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea-chest. it is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters were full, and it had therefore not been used.” “for all that, its presence has some significance,” said holmes. “however, let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case.” “there was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.” “what part of the table?” “it lay in the middle. it was of coarse sealskin—the straight-haired skin, with a leather thong to bind it. inside was ‘p.c.’ on the flap. there was half an ounce of strong ship’s tobacco in it.” “excellent! what more?” stanley hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-covered notebook. the outside was rough and worn, the leaves discoloured. on the first page were written the initials “j.h.n.” and the date “1883.” holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way, while hopkins and i gazed over each shoulder. on the second page were the printed letters “c.p.r.,” and then came several sheets of numbers. another heading was “argentine,” another “costa rica,” and another “san paulo,” each with pages of signs and figures after it. “what do you make of these?” asked holmes. “they appear to be lists of stock exchange securities. i thought that ‘j.h.n.’ were the initials of a broker, and that ‘c.p.r.’ may have been his client.” “try canadian pacific railway,” said holmes. stanley hopkins swore between his teeth, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand. “what a fool i have been!” he cried. “of course, it is as you say. then ‘j.h.n.’ are the only initials we have to solve. i have already examined the old stock exchange lists, and i can find no one in 1883, either in the house or among the outside brokers, whose initials correspond with these. yet i feel that the clue is the most important one that i hold. you will admit, mr. holmes, that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present—in other words, of the murderer. i would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime.” sherlock holmes’s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development. “i must admit both your points,” said he. “i confess that this notebook, which did not appear at the inquest, modifies any views which i may have formed. i had come to a theory of the crime in which i can find no place for this. have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?” “inquiries are now being made at the offices, but i fear that the complete register of the stockholders of these south american concerns is in south america, and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares.” holmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying lens. “surely there is some discolouration here,” said he. “yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. i told you that i picked the book off the floor.” “was the blood-stain above or below?” “on the side next the boards.” “which proves, of course, that the book was dropped after the crime was committed.” “exactly, mr. holmes. i appreciated that point, and i conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight. it lay near the door.” “i suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?” “no, sir.” “have you any reason to suspect robbery?” “no, sir. nothing seemed to have been touched.” “dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case. then there was a knife, was there not?” “a sheath-knife, still in its sheath. it lay at the feet of the dead man. mrs. carey has identified it as being her husband’s property.” holmes was lost in thought for some time. “well,” said he, at last, “i suppose i shall have to come out and have a look at it.” stanley hopkins gave a cry of joy. “thank you, sir. that will, indeed, be a weight off my mind.” holmes shook his finger at the inspector. “it would have been an easier task a week ago,” said he. “but even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless. watson, if you can spare the time, i should be very glad of your company. if you will call a four-wheeler, hopkins, we shall be ready to start for forest row in a quarter of an hour.” alighting at the small wayside station, we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods, which were once part of that great forest which for so long held the saxon invaders at bay—the impenetrable “weald,” for sixty years the bulwark of britain. vast sections of it have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first iron-works of the country, and the trees have been felled to smelt the ore. now the richer fields of the north have absorbed the trade, and nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the work of the past. here, in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill, stood a long, low, stone house, approached by a curving drive running through the fields. nearer the road, and surrounded on three sides by bushes, was a small outhouse, one window and the door facing in our direction. it was the scene of the murder. stanley hopkins led us first to the house, where he introduced us to a haggard, grey-haired woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose gaunt and deep-lined face, with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her red-rimmed eyes, told of the years of hardship and ill-usage which she had endured. with her was her daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl, whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead, and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down. it was a terrible household that black peter carey had made for himself, and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man. the outhouse was the simplest of dwellings, wooden-walled, shingle-roofed, one window beside the door and one on the farther side. stanley hopkins drew the key from his pocket and had stooped to the lock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face. “someone has been tampering with it,” he said. there could be no doubt of the fact. the woodwork was cut, and the scratches showed white through the paint, as if they had been that instant done. holmes had been examining the window. “someone has tried to force this also. whoever it was has failed to make his way in. he must have been a very poor burglar.” “this is a most extraordinary thing,” said the inspector, “i could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening.” “some curious person from the village, perhaps,” i suggested. “very unlikely. few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds, far less try to force their way into the cabin. what do you think of it, mr. holmes?” “i think that fortune is very kind to us.” “you mean that the person will come again?” “it is very probable. he came expecting to find the door open. he tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife. he could not manage it. what would he do?” “come again next night with a more useful tool.” “so i should say. it will be our fault if we are not there to receive him. meanwhile, let me see the inside of the cabin.” the traces of the tragedy had been removed, but the furniture within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime. for two hours, with most intense concentration, holmes examined every object in turn, but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one. once only he paused in his patient investigation. “have you taken anything off this shelf, hopkins?” “no, i have moved nothing.” “something has been taken. there is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere. it may have been a book lying on its side. it may have been a box. well, well, i can do nothing more. let us walk in these beautiful woods, watson, and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers. we shall meet you here later, hopkins, and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night.” it was past eleven o’clock when we formed our little ambuscade. hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open, but holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger. the lock was a perfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it back. holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut, but outside it, among the bushes which grew round the farther window. in this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit. it was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet brought with it something of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water-pool, and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey. what savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness? was it a fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only to the weak and unguarded? in absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever might come. at first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of voices from the village, lightened our vigil, but one by one these interruptions died away, and an absolute stillness fell upon us, save for the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us in. half-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes the dawn, when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate. someone had entered the drive. again there was a long silence, and i had begun to fear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a moment later a metallic scraping and clinking. the man was trying to force the lock. this time his skill was greater or his tool was better, for there was a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. then a match was struck, and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut. through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the scene within. the nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail and thin, with a black moustache, which intensified the deadly pallor of his face. he could not have been much above twenty years of age. i have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chattering, and he was shaking in every limb. he was dressed like a gentleman, in norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head. we watched him staring round with frightened eyes. then he laid the candle-end upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners. he returned with a large book, one of the logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves. leaning on the table, he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought. then, with an angry gesture of his clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it in the corner, and put out the light. he had hardly turned to leave the hut when hopkin’s hand was on the fellow’s collar, and i heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken. the candle was relit, and there was our wretched captive, shivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective. he sank down upon the sea-chest, and looked helplessly from one of us to the other. “now, my fine fellow,” said stanley hopkins, “who are you, and what do you want here?” the man pulled himself together, and faced us with an effort at self-composure. “you are detectives, i suppose?” said he. “you imagine i am connected with the death of captain peter carey. i assure you that i am innocent.” “we’ll see about that,” said hopkins. “first of all, what is your name?” “it is john hopley neligan.” i saw holmes and hopkins exchange a quick glance. “what are you doing here?” “can i speak confidentially?” “no, certainly not.” “why should i tell you?” “if you have no answer, it may go badly with you at the trial.” the young man winced. “well, i will tell you,” he said. “why should i not? and yet i hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. did you ever hear of dawson and neligan?” i could see, from hopkins’s face, that he never had, but holmes was keenly interested. “you mean the west country bankers,” said he. “they failed for a million, ruined half the county families of cornwall, and neligan disappeared.” “exactly. neligan was my father.” at last we were getting something positive, and yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding banker and captain peter carey pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons. we all listened intently to the young man’s words. “it was my father who was really concerned. dawson had retired. i was only ten years of age at the time, but i was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all. it has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled. it is not true. it was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them, all would be well and every creditor paid in full. he started in his little yacht for norway just before the warrant was issued for his arrest. i can remember that last night when he bade farewell to my mother. he left us a list of the securities he was taking, and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared, and that none who had trusted him would suffer. well, no word was ever heard from him again. both the yacht and he vanished utterly. we believed, my mother and i, that he and it, with the securities that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of the sea. we had a faithful friend, however, who is a business man, and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him had reappeared on the london market. you can imagine our amazement. i spent months in trying to trace them, and at last, after many doubtings and difficulties, i discovered that the original seller had been captain peter carey, the owner of this hut. “naturally, i made some inquiries about the man. i found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to norway. the autumn of that year was a stormy one, and there was a long succession of southerly gales. my father’s yacht may well have been blown to the north, and there met by captain peter carey’s ship. if that were so, what had become of my father? in any case, if i could prove from peter carey’s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them. “i came down to sussex with the intention of seeing the captain, but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred. i read at the inquest a description of his cabin, in which it stated that the old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it. it struck me that if i could see what occurred in the month of august, 1883, on board the _sea unicorn_, i might settle the mystery of my father’s fate. i tried last night to get at these logbooks, but was unable to open the door. to-night i tried again and succeeded, but i find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book. it was at that moment i found myself a prisoner in your hands.” “is that all?” asked hopkins. “yes, that is all.” his eyes shifted as he said it. “you have nothing else to tell us?” he hesitated. “no, there is nothing.” “you have not been here before last night?” “no.” “then how do you account for _that_?” cried hopkins, as he held up the damning notebook, with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the blood-stain on the cover. the wretched man collapsed. he sank his face in his hands, and trembled all over. “where did you get it?” he groaned. “i did not know. i thought i had lost it at the hotel.” “that is enough,” said hopkins, sternly. “whatever else you have to say, you must say in court. you will walk down with me now to the police-station. well, mr. holmes, i am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me. as it turns out your presence was unnecessary, and i would have brought the case to this successful issue without you, but, none the less, i am grateful. rooms have been reserved for you at the brambletye hotel, so we can all walk down to the village together.” “well, watson, what do you think of it?” asked holmes, as we travelled back next morning. “i can see that you are not satisfied.” “oh, yes, my dear watson, i am perfectly satisfied. at the same time, stanley hopkins’s methods do not commend themselves to me. i am disappointed in stanley hopkins. i had hoped for better things from him. one should always look for a possible alternative, and provide against it. it is the first rule of criminal investigation.” “what, then, is the alternative?” “the line of investigation which i have myself been pursuing. it may give us nothing. i cannot tell. but at least i shall follow it to the end.” several letters were waiting for holmes at baker street. he snatched one of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter. “excellent, watson! the alternative develops. have you telegraph forms? just write a couple of messages for me: ‘sumner, shipping agent, ratcliff highway. send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow morning.—basil.’ that’s my name in those parts. the other is: ‘inspector stanley hopkins, 46 lord street, brixton. come breakfast to-morrow at nine-thirty. important. wire if unable to come.—sherlock holmes.’ there, watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. i hereby banish it completely from my presence. to-morrow, i trust that we shall hear the last of it forever.” sharp at the hour named inspector stanley hopkins appeared, and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which mrs. hudson had prepared. the young detective was in high spirits at his success. “you really think that your solution must be correct?” asked holmes. “i could not imagine a more complete case.” “it did not seem to me conclusive.” “you astonish me, mr. holmes. what more could one ask for?” “does your explanation cover every point?” “undoubtedly. i find that young neligan arrived at the brambletye hotel on the very day of the crime. he came on the pretence of playing golf. his room was on the ground-floor, and he could get out when he liked. that very night he went down to woodman’s lee, saw peter carey at the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him with the harpoon. then, horrified by what he had done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the notebook which he had brought with him in order to question peter carey about these different securities. you may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks, and the others—the great majority—were not. those which are ticked have been traced on the london market, but the others, presumably, were still in the possession of carey, and young neligan, according to his own account, was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father’s creditors. after his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time, but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed. surely that is all simple and obvious?” holmes smiled and shook his head. “it seems to me to have only one drawback, hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impossible. have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body? no? tut, tut my dear sir, you must really pay attention to these details. my friend watson could tell you that i spent a whole morning in that exercise. it is no easy matter, and requires a strong and practised arm. but this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall. do you imagine that this anæmic youth was capable of so frightful an assault? is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with black peter in the dead of the night? was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before? no, no, hopkins, it is another and more formidable person for whom we must seek.” the detective’s face had grown longer and longer during holmes’s speech. his hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him. but he would not abandon his position without a struggle. “you can’t deny that neligan was present that night, mr. holmes. the book will prove that. i fancy that i have evidence enough to satisfy a jury, even if you are able to pick a hole in it. besides, mr. holmes, i have laid my hand upon _my_ man. as to this terrible person of yours, where is he?” “i rather fancy that he is on the stair,” said holmes, serenely. “i think, watson, that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it.” he rose and laid a written paper upon a side-table. “now we are ready,” said he. there had been some talking in gruff voices outside, and now mrs. hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for captain basil. “show them in one by one,” said holmes. “the first who entered was a little ribston pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white side-whiskers. holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket. “what name?” he asked. “james lancaster.” “i am sorry, lancaster, but the berth is full. here is half a sovereign for your trouble. just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes.” the second man was a long, dried-up creature, with lank hair and sallow cheeks. his name was hugh pattins. he also received his dismissal, his half-sovereign, and the order to wait. the third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance. a fierce bull-dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold, dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows. he saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turning his cap round in his hands. “your name?” asked holmes. “patrick cairns.” “harpooner?” “yes, sir. twenty-six voyages.” “dundee, i suppose?” “yes, sir.” “and ready to start with an exploring ship?” “yes, sir.” “what wages?” “eight pounds a month.” “could you start at once?” “as soon as i get my kit.” “have you your papers?” “yes, sir.” he took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket. holmes glanced over them and returned them. “you are just the man i want,” said he. “here’s the agreement on the side-table. if you sign it the whole matter will be settled.” the seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen. “shall i sign here?” he asked, stooping over the table. holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck. “this will do,” said he. i heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull. the next instant holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together. he was a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the handcuffs which holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists, he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had hopkins and i not rushed to his rescue. only when i pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last understand that resistance was vain. we lashed his ankles with cord, and rose breathless from the struggle. “i must really apologize, hopkins,” said sherlock holmes. “i fear that the scrambled eggs are cold. however, you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better, will you not, for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion.” stanley hopkins was speechless with amazement. “i don’t know what to say, mr. holmes,” he blurted out at last, with a very red face. “it seems to me that i have been making a fool of myself from the beginning. i understand now, what i should never have forgotten, that i am the pupil and you are the master. even now i see what you have done, but i don’t know how you did it or what it signifies.” “well, well,” said holmes, good-humouredly. “we all learn by experience, and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative. you were so absorbed in young neligan that you could not spare a thought to patrick cairns, the true murderer of peter carey.” the hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation. “see here, mister,” said he, “i make no complaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but i would have you call things by their right names. you say i murdered peter carey, i say i _killed_ peter carey, and there’s all the difference. maybe you don’t believe what i say. maybe you think i am just slinging you a yarn.” “not at all,” said holmes. “let us hear what you have to say.” “it’s soon told, and, by the lord, every word of it is truth. i knew black peter, and when he pulled out his knife i whipped a harpoon through him sharp, for i knew that it was him or me. that’s how he died. you can call it murder. anyhow, i’d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with black peter’s knife in my heart.” “how came you there?” asked holmes. “i’ll tell it you from the beginning. just sit me up a little, so as i can speak easy. it was in ’83 that it happened—august of that year. peter carey was master of the _sea unicorn_, and i was spare harpooner. we were coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week’s southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. there was one man on her—a landsman. the crew had thought she would founder and had made for the norwegian coast in the dinghy. i guess they were all drowned. well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. all the baggage we took off with him was one tin box. so far as i know, the man’s name was never mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been. it was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for, with my own eyes, i saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the shetland lights. well, i kept my knowledge to myself, and waited to see what would come of it. when we got back to scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. a stranger died by accident and it was nobody’s business to inquire. shortly after peter carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before i could find where he was. i guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut. i found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in london, and down i went to squeeze him. the first night he was reasonable enough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life. we were to fix it all two nights later. when i came, i found him three parts drunk and in a vile temper. we sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times, but the more he drank the less i liked the look on his face. i spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and i thought i might need it before i was through. then at last he broke out at me, spitting and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his hand. he had not time to get it from the sheath before i had the harpoon through him. heavens! what a yell he gave! and his face gets between me and my sleep. i stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and i waited for a bit, but all was quiet, so i took heart once more. i looked round, and there was the tin box on the shelf. i had as much right to it as peter carey, anyhow, so i took it with me and left the hut. like a fool i left my baccy-pouch upon the table. “now i’ll tell you the queerest part of the whole story. i had hardly got outside the hut when i heard someone coming, and i hid among the bushes. a man came slinking along, went into the hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and legged it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight. who he was or what he wanted is more than i can tell. for my part i walked ten miles, got a train at tunbridge wells, and so reached london, and no one the wiser. “well, when i came to examine the box i found there was no money in it, and nothing but papers that i would not dare to sell. i had lost my hold on black peter and was stranded in london without a shilling. there was only my trade left. i saw these advertisements about harpooners, and high wages, so i went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here. that’s all i know, and i say again that if i killed black peter, the law should give me thanks, for i saved them the price of a hempen rope.” “a very clear statement said holmes,” rising and lighting his pipe. “i think, hopkins, that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety. this room is not well adapted for a cell, and mr. patrick cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet.” “mr. holmes,” said hopkins, “i do not know how to express my gratitude. even now i do not understand how you attained this result.” “simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning. it is very possible if i had known about this notebook it might have led away my thoughts, as it did yours. but all i heard pointed in the one direction. the amazing strength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the rum and water, the sealskin tobacco-pouch with the coarse tobacco—all these pointed to a seaman, and one who had been a whaler. i was convinced that the initials ‘p.c.’ upon the pouch were a coincidence, and not those of peter carey, since he seldom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin. you remember that i asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin. you said they were. how many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits? yes, i was certain it was a seaman.” “and how did you find him?” “my dear sir, the problem had become a very simple one. if it were a seaman, it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the _sea unicorn_. so far as i could learn he had sailed in no other ship. i spent three days in wiring to dundee, and at the end of that time i had ascertained the names of the crew of the _sea unicorn_ in 1883. when i found patrick cairns among the harpooners, my research was nearing its end. i argued that the man was probably in london, and that he would desire to leave the country for a time. i therefore spent some days in the east end, devised an arctic expedition, put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under captain basil—and behold the result!” “wonderful!” cried hopkins. “wonderful!” “you must obtain the release of young neligan as soon as possible,” said holmes. “i confess that i think you owe him some apology. the tin box must be returned to him, but, of course, the securities which peter carey has sold are lost forever. there’s the cab, hopkins, and you can remove your man. if you want me for the trial, my address and that of watson will be somewhere in norway—i’ll send particulars later.” the adventure of charles augustus milverton it is years since the incidents of which i speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that i allude to them. for a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public, but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. it records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of mr. sherlock holmes and of myself. the reader will excuse me if i conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence. we had been out for one of our evening rambles, holmes and i, and had returned about six o’clock on a cold, frosty winter’s evening. as holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. he glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. i picked it up and read: charles augustus milverton, appledore towers, hampstead. _agent_. “who is he?” i asked. “the worst man in london,” holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. “is anything on the back of the card?” i turned it over. “will call at 6:30—c.a.m.,” i read. “hum! he’s about due. do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, watson, when you stand before the serpents in the zoo, and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces? well, that’s how milverton impresses me. i’ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which i have for this fellow. and yet i can’t get out of doing business with him—indeed, he is here at my invitation.” “but who is he?” “i’ll tell you, watson. he is the king of all the blackmailers. heaven help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of milverton! with a smiling face and a heart of marble, he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. the fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. his method is as follows: he allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and position. he receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians, who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. he deals with no niggard hand. i happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. everything which is in the market goes to milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. no one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. he will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. i have said that he is the worst man in london, and i would ask you how could one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons his mate, with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?” i had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling. “but surely,” said i, “the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?” “technically, no doubt, but practically not. what would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months’ imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? his victims dare not hit back. if ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we should have him, but he is as cunning as the evil one. no, no, we must find other ways to fight him.” “and why is he here?” “because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. it is the lady eva blackwell, the most beautiful _débutante_ of last season. she is to be married in a fortnight to the earl of dovercourt. this fiend has several imprudent letters—imprudent, watson, nothing worse—which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. they would suffice to break off the match. milverton will send the letters to the earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. i have been commissioned to meet him, and—to make the best terms i can.” at that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below. looking down i saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. a footman opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended. a minute later he was in the room. charles augustus milverton was a man of fifty, with a large, intellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen smile, and two keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad, gold-rimmed glasses. there was something of mr. pickwick’s benevolence in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. his voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit. holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. milverton’s smile broadened, he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair, and then took a seat. “this gentleman?” said he, with a wave in my direction. “is it discreet? is it right?” “dr. watson is my friend and partner.” “very good, mr. holmes. it is only in your client’s interests that i protested. the matter is so very delicate——” “dr. watson has already heard of it.” “then we can proceed to business. you say that you are acting for lady eva. has she empowered you to accept my terms?” “what are your terms?” “seven thousand pounds.” “and the alternative?” “my dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it, but if the money is not paid on the 14th, there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.” his insufferable smile was more complacent than ever. holmes thought for a little. “you appear to me,” he said, at last, “to be taking matters too much for granted. i am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters. my client will certainly do what i may advise. i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.” milverton chuckled. “you evidently do not know the earl,” said he. from the baffled look upon holmes’s face, i could see clearly that he did. “what harm is there in the letters?” he asked. “they are sprightly—very sprightly,” milverton answered. “the lady was a charming correspondent. but i can assure you that the earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them. however, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest at that. it is purely a matter of business. if you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.” he rose and seized his astrakhan coat. holmes was grey with anger and mortification. “wait a little,” he said. “you go too fast. we should certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.” milverton relapsed into his chair. “i was sure that you would see it in that light,” he purred. “at the same time,” holmes continued, “lady eva is not a wealthy woman. i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. i beg, therefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate, which is, i assure you, the highest that you can get.” milverton’s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously. “i am aware that what you say is true about the lady’s resources,” said he. “at the same time you must admit that the occasion of a lady’s marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf. they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present. let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes in london.” “it is impossible,” said holmes. “dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!” cried milverton, taking out a bulky pocketbook. “i cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in not making an effort. look at this!” he held up a little note with a coat-of-arms upon the envelope. “that belongs to—well, perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. but at that time it will be in the hands of the lady’s husband. and all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste. it _is_ such a pity! now, you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking? only two days before the wedding, there was a paragraph in the _morning post_ to say that it was all off. and why? it is almost incredible, but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question. is it not pitiful? and here i find you, a man of sense, boggling about terms, when your client’s future and honour are at stake. you surprise me, mr. holmes.” “what i say is true,” holmes answered. “the money cannot be found. surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which i offer than to ruin this woman’s career, which can profit you in no way?” “there you make a mistake, mr. holmes. an exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. i have eight or ten similar cases maturing. if it was circulated among them that i had made a severe example of the lady eva, i should find all of them much more open to reason. you see my point?” holmes sprang from his chair. “get behind him, watson! don’t let him out! now, sir, let us see the contents of that notebook.” milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall. “mr. holmes, mr. holmes,” he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. “i have been expecting you to do something original. this has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? i assure you that i am armed to the teeth, and i am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. besides, your supposition that i would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken. i would do nothing so foolish. and now, gentlemen, i have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to hampstead.” he stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. i picked up a chair, but holmes shook his head, and i laid it down again. with a bow, a smile, and a twinkle, milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away. holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. for half an hour he was silent and still. then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. a little later a rakish young workman, with a goatee beard and a swagger, lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. “i’ll be back some time, watson,” said he, and vanished into the night. i understood that he had opened his campaign against charles augustus milverton, but i little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take. for some days holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at hampstead, and that it was not wasted, i knew nothing of what he was doing. at last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion. “you would not call me a marrying man, watson?” “no, indeed!” “you’ll be interested to hear that i’m engaged.” “my dear fellow! i congrat——” “to milverton’s housemaid.” “good heavens, holmes!” “i wanted information, watson.” “surely you have gone too far?” “it was a most necessary step. i am a plumber with a rising business, escott, by name. i have walked out with her each evening, and i have talked with her. good heavens, those talks! however, i have got all i wanted. i know milverton’s house as i know the palm of my hand.” “but the girl, holmes?” he shrugged his shoulders. “you can’t help it, my dear watson. you must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table. however, i rejoice to say that i have a hated rival, who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned. what a splendid night it is!” “you like this weather?” “it suits my purpose. watson, i mean to burgle milverton’s house to-night.” i had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words, which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. as a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wild landscape, so at one glance i seemed to see every possible result of such an action—the detection, the capture, the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious milverton. “for heaven’s sake, holmes, think what you are doing,” i cried. “my dear fellow, i have given it every consideration. i am never precipitate in my actions, nor would i adopt so energetic and, indeed, so dangerous a course, if any other were possible. let us look at the matter clearly and fairly. i suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. to burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocketbook—an action in which you were prepared to aid me.” i turned it over in my mind. “yes,” i said, “it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.” “exactly. since it is morally justifiable, i have only to consider the question of personal risk. surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this, when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?” “you will be in such a false position.” “well, that is part of the risk. there is no other possible way of regaining these letters. the unfortunate lady has not the money, and there are none of her people in whom she could confide. to-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night, this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. i must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or i must play this last card. between ourselves, watson, it’s a sporting duel between this fellow milverton and me. he had, as you saw, the best of the first exchanges, but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish.” “well, i don’t like it, but i suppose it must be,” said i. “when do we start?” “you are not coming.” “then you are not going,” said i. “i give you my word of honour—and i never broke it in my life—that i will take a cab straight to the police-station and give you away, unless you let me share this adventure with you.” “you can’t help me.” “how do you know that? you can’t tell what may happen. anyway, my resolution is taken. other people besides you have self-respect, and even reputations.” holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on the shoulder. “well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. we have shared this same room for some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell. you know, watson, i don’t mind confessing to you that i have always had an idea that i would have made a highly efficient criminal. this is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. see here!” he took a neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited a number of shining instruments. “this is a first-class, up-to-date burgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter, adaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands. here, too, is my dark lantern. everything is in order. have you a pair of silent shoes?” “i have rubber-soled tennis shoes.” “excellent! and a mask?” “i can make a couple out of black silk.” “i can see that you have a strong, natural turn for this sort of thing. very good, do you make the masks. we shall have some cold supper before we start. it is now nine-thirty. at eleven we shall drive as far as church row. it is a quarter of an hour’s walk from there to appledore towers. we shall be at work before midnight. milverton is a heavy sleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty. with any luck we should be back here by two, with the lady eva’s letters in my pocket.” holmes and i put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two theatre-goers homeward bound. in oxford street we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in hampstead. here we paid off our cab, and with our great coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold, and the wind seemed to blow through us, we walked along the edge of the heath. “it’s a business that needs delicate treatment,” said holmes. “these documents are contained in a safe in the fellow’s study, and the study is the ante-room of his bed-chamber. on the other hand, like all these stout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper. agatha—that’s my _fiancée_—says it is a joke in the servants’ hall that it’s impossible to wake the master. he has a secretary who is devoted to his interests, and never budges from the study all day. that’s why we are going at night. then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. i met agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run. this is the house, this big one in its own grounds. through the gate—now to the right among the laurels. we might put on our masks here, i think. you see, there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.” with our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in london, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house. a sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several windows and two doors. “that’s his bedroom,” holmes whispered. “this door opens straight into the study. it would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and we should make too much noise getting in. come round here. there’s a greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.” the place was locked, but holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside. an instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. the thick, warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat. he seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. holmes had remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark. still holding my hand in one of his, he opened a door, and i was vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before. he felt his way among the furniture, opened another door, and closed it behind us. putting out my hand i felt several coats hanging from the wall, and i understood that i was in a passage. we passed along it and holmes very gently opened a door upon the right-hand side. something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth, but i could have laughed when i realized that it was the cat. a fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very gently closed the door. we were in milverton’s study, and a _portière_ at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom. it was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. near the door i saw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it had been safe, to turn it on. at one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. on the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda. a desk stood in the centre, with a turning-chair of shining red leather. opposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of athene on the top. in the corner, between the bookcase and the wall, there stood a tall, green safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its face. holmes stole across and looked at it. then he crept to the door of the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. no sound came from within. meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door, so i examined it. to my amazement, it was neither locked nor bolted. i touched holmes on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that direction. i saw him start, and he was evidently as surprised as i. “i don’t like it,” he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. “i can’t quite make it out. anyhow, we have no time to lose.” “can i do anything?” “yes, stand by the door. if you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away as we came. if they come the other way, we can get through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window curtains if it is not. do you understand?” i nodded, and stood by the door. my first feeling of fear had passed away, and i thrilled now with a keener zest than i had ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. the high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. far from feeling guilty, i rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. with a glow of admiration i watched holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. i knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and i understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat—he had placed his overcoat on a chair—holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. i stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready for any emergency, though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what i should do if we were interrupted. for half an hour, holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. finally i heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside i had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. holmes picked one out, but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. suddenly i saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same. it was only when i had joined him there that i heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. there was a noise somewhere within the house. a door slammed in the distance. then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. they were in the passage outside the room. they paused at the door. the door opened. there was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. the door closed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne to our nostrils. then the footsteps continued backward and forward, backward and forward, within a few yards of us. finally there was a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. then a key clicked in a lock, and i heard the rustle of papers. so far i had not dared to look out, but now i gently parted the division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through. from the pressure of holmes’s shoulder against mine, i knew that he was sharing my observations. right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of milverton. it was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. his broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. he was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. he wore a semi-military smoking jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. in his hand he held a long, legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. there was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude. i felt holmes’s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situation was within his powers, and that he was easy in his mind. i was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and that milverton might at any moment observe it. in my own mind i had determined that if i were sure, from the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his eye, i would at once spring out, throw my great coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to holmes. but milverton never looked up. he was languidly interested by the papers in his hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer. at least, i thought, when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room, but before he had reached the end of either, there came a remarkable development, which turned our thoughts into quite another channel. several times i had observed that milverton looked at his watch, and once he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. the idea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside. milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair. the sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the door. milverton rose and opened it. “well,” said he, curtly, “you are nearly half an hour late.” so this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of milverton. there was the gentle rustle of a woman’s dress. i had closed the slit between the curtains as milverton’s face had turned in our direction, but now i ventured very carefully to open it once more. he had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of his mouth. in front of him, in the full glare of the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face, a mantle drawn round her chin. her breath came quick and fast, and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion. “well,” said milverton, “you made me lose a good night’s rest, my dear. i hope you’ll prove worth it. you couldn’t come any other time—eh?” the woman shook her head. “well, if you couldn’t you couldn’t. if the countess is a hard mistress, you have your chance to get level with her now. bless the girl, what are you shivering about? that’s right. pull yourself together. now, let us get down to business.” he took a notebook from the drawer of his desk. “you say that you have five letters which compromise the countess d’albert. you want to sell them. i want to buy them. so far so good. it only remains to fix a price. i should want to inspect the letters, of course. if they are really good specimens—great heavens, is it you?” the woman, without a word, had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin. it was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted milverton—a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading hard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous smile. “it is i,” she said, “the woman whose life you have ruined.” milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. “you were so very obstinate,” said he. “why did you drive me to such extremities? i assure you i wouldn’t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his business, and what was i to do? i put the price well within your means. you would not pay.” “so you sent the letters to my husband, and he—the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man whose boots i was never worthy to lace—he broke his gallant heart and died. you remember that last night, when i came through that door, i begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching. yes, you never thought to see me here again, but it was that night which taught me how i could meet you face to face, and alone. well, charles milverton, what have you to say?” “don’t imagine that you can bully me,” said he, rising to his feet. “i have only to raise my voice and i could call my servants and have you arrested. but i will make allowance for your natural anger. leave the room at once as you came, and i will say no more.” the woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly smile on her thin lips. “you will ruin no more lives as you have ruined mine. you will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine. i will free the world of a poisonous thing. take that, you hound—and that!—and that!—and that!” she had drawn a little gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after barrel into milverton’s body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front. he shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, coughing furiously and clawing among the papers. then he staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. “you’ve done me,” he cried, and lay still. the woman looked at him intently, and ground her heel into his upturned face. she looked again, but there was no sound or movement. i heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated room, and the avenger was gone. no interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate, but, as the woman poured bullet after bullet into milverton’s shrinking body i was about to spring out, when i felt holmes’s cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. i understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining grip—that it was no affair of ours, that justice had overtaken a villain, that we had our own duties and our own objects, which were not to be lost sight of. but hardly had the woman rushed from the room when holmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. he turned the key in the lock. at the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet. the revolver shots had roused the household. with perfect coolness holmes slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. holmes looked swiftly round. the letter which had been the messenger of death for milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers. then he drew the key from the outer door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. “this way, watson,” said he, “we can scale the garden wall in this direction.” i could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly. looking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. the front door was open, and figures were rushing down the drive. the whole garden was alive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels. holmes seemed to know the grounds perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees, i close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting behind us. it was a six-foot wall which barred our path, but he sprang to the top and over. as i did the same i felt the hand of the man behind me grab at my ankle, but i kicked myself free and scrambled over a grass-strewn coping. i fell upon my face among some bushes, but holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of hampstead heath. we had run two miles, i suppose, before holmes at last halted and listened intently. all was absolute silence behind us. we had shaken off our pursuers and were safe. we had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after the remarkable experience which i have recorded, when mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, very solemn and impressive, was ushered into our modest sitting-room. “good-morning, mr. holmes,” said he; “good-morning. may i ask if you are very busy just now?” “not too busy to listen to you.” “i thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case, which occurred only last night at hampstead.” “dear me!” said holmes. “what was that?” “a murder—a most dramatic and remarkable murder. i know how keen you are upon these things, and i would take it as a great favour if you would step down to appledore towers, and give us the benefit of your advice. it is no ordinary crime. we have had our eyes upon this mr. milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a villain. he is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. these papers have all been burned by the murderers. no article of value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure.” “criminals?” said holmes. “plural?” “yes, there were two of them. they were as nearly as possible captured red-handed. we have their footmarks, we have their description, it’s ten to one that we trace them. the first fellow was a bit too active, but the second was caught by the under-gardener, and only got away after a struggle. he was a middle-sized, strongly built man—square jaw, thick neck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.” “that’s rather vague,” said sherlock holmes. “my, it might be a description of watson!” “it’s true,” said the inspector, with amusement. “it might be a description of watson.” “well, i’m afraid i can’t help you, lestrade,” said holmes. “the fact is that i knew this fellow milverton, that i considered him one of the most dangerous men in london, and that i think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. no, it’s no use arguing. i have made up my mind. my sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim, and i will not handle this case.” holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed, but i observed all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner, of a man who is striving to recall something to his memory. we were in the middle of our lunch, when he suddenly sprang to his feet. “by jove, watson, i’ve got it!” he cried. “take your hat! come with me!” he hurried at his top speed down baker street and along oxford street, until we had almost reached regent circus. here, on the left hand, there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day. holmes’s eyes fixed themselves upon one of them, and following his gaze i saw the picture of a regal and stately lady in court dress, with a high diamond tiara upon her noble head. i looked at that delicately curved nose, at the marked eyebrows, at the straight mouth, and the strong little chin beneath it. then i caught my breath as i read the time-honoured title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been. my eyes met those of holmes, and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window. the adventure of the six napoleons it was no very unusual thing for mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to sherlock holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police headquarters. in return for the news which lestrade would bring, holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience. on this particular evening, lestrade had spoken of the weather and the newspapers. then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his cigar. holmes looked keenly at him. “anything remarkable on hand?” he asked. “oh, no, mr. holmes—nothing very particular.” “then tell me about it.” lestrade laughed. “well, mr. holmes, there is no use denying that there _is_ something on my mind. and yet it is such an absurd business, that i hesitated to bother you about it. on the other hand, although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and i know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common. but, in my opinion, it comes more in dr. watson’s line than ours.” “disease?” said i. “madness, anyhow. and a queer madness, too. you wouldn’t think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of napoleon the first that he would break any image of him that he could see.” holmes sank back in his chair. “that’s no business of mine,” said he. “exactly. that’s what i said. but then, when the man commits burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.” holmes sat up again. “burglary! this is more interesting. let me hear the details.” lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory from its pages. “the first case reported was four days ago,” said he. “it was at the shop of morse hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the kennington road. the assistant had left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of napoleon, which stood with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into fragments. he rushed out into the road, but, although several passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of identifying the rascal. it seemed to be one of those senseless acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. the plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation. “the second case, however, was more serious, and also more singular. it occurred only last night. “in kennington road, and within a few hundred yards of morse hudson’s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner, named dr. barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the thames. his residence and principal consulting-room is at kennington road, but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at lower brixton road, two miles away. this dr. barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of napoleon, and his house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the french emperor. some little time ago he purchased from morse hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of napoleon by the french sculptor, devine. one of these he placed in his hall in the house at kennington road, and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at lower brixton. well, when dr. barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall. it had been carried out and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered fragments were discovered.” holmes rubbed his hands. “this is certainly very novel,” said he. “i thought it would please you. but i have not got to the end yet. dr. barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o’clock, and you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. it had been smashed to atoms where it stood. in neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. now, mr. holmes, you have got the facts.” “they are singular, not to say grotesque,” said holmes. “may i ask whether the two busts smashed in dr. barnicot’s rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in morse hudson’s shop?” “they were taken from the same mould.” “such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of napoleon. considering how many hundreds of statues of the great emperor must exist in london, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust.” “well, i thought as you do,” said lestrade. “on the other hand, this morse hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of london, and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years. so, although, as you say, there are many hundreds of statues in london, it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district. therefore, a local fanatic would begin with them. what do you think, dr. watson?” “there are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,” i answered. “there is the condition which the modern french psychologists have called the _idée fixe_, which may be trifling in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other way. a man who had read deeply about napoleon, or who had possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great war, might conceivably form such an _idée fixe_ and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.” “that won’t do, my dear watson,” said holmes, shaking his head, “for no amount of _idée fixe_ would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.” “well, how do _you_ explain it?” “i don’t attempt to do so. i would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentleman’s eccentric proceedings. for example, in dr. barnicot’s hall, where a sound might arouse the family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it stood. the affair seems absurdly trifling, and yet i dare call nothing trivial when i reflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. you will remember, watson, how the dreadful business of the abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. i can’t afford, therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, lestrade, and i shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh development of so singular a chain of events.” the development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. i was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a tap at the door and holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. he read it aloud: “come instantly, 131, pitt street, kensington.—lestrade.” “what is it, then?” i asked. “don’t know—may be anything. but i suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues. in that case our friend the image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of london. there’s coffee on the table, watson, and i have a cab at the door.” in half an hour we had reached pitt street, a quiet little backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of london life. no. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unromantic dwellings. as we drove up, we found the railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. holmes whistled. “by george! it’s attempted murder at the least. nothing less will hold the london message-boy. there’s a deed of violence indicated in that fellow’s round shoulders and outstretched neck. what’s this, watson? the top steps swilled down and the other ones dry. footsteps enough, anyhow! well, well, there’s lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know all about it.” the official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and down. he was introduced to us as the owner of the house—mr. horace harker, of the central press syndicate. “it’s the napoleon bust business again,” said lestrade. “you seemed interested last night, mr. holmes, so i thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn.” “what has it turned to, then?” “to murder. mr. harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred?” the man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face. “it’s an extraordinary thing,” said he, “that all my life i have been collecting other people’s news, and now that a real piece of news has come my own way i am so confused and bothered that i can’t put two words together. if i had come in here as a journalist, i should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. as it is, i am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people, and i can make no use of it myself. however, i’ve heard your name, mr. sherlock holmes, and if you’ll only explain this queer business, i shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story.” holmes sat down and listened. “it all seems to centre round that bust of napoleon which i bought for this very room about four months ago. i picked it up cheap from harding brothers, two doors from the high street station. a great deal of my journalistic work is done at night, and i often write until the early morning. so it was to-day. i was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house, about three o’clock, when i was convinced that i heard some sounds downstairs. i listened, but they were not repeated, and i concluded that they came from outside. then suddenly, about five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell—the most dreadful sound, mr. holmes, that ever i heard. it will ring in my ears as long as i live. i sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. then i seized the poker and went downstairs. when i entered this room i found the window wide open, and i at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. why any burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever. “you can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride. this was clearly what the burglar had done, so i went round and opened the door. stepping out into the dark, i nearly fell over a dead man, who was lying there. i ran back for a light and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood. he lay on his back, his knees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. i shall see him in my dreams. i had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then i must have fainted, for i knew nothing more until i found the policeman standing over me in the hall.” “well, who was the murdered man?” asked holmes. “there’s nothing to show who he was,” said lestrade. “you shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. he is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. he is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. a horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, i do not know. there was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map of london, and a photograph. here it is.” it was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. it represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the face, like the muzzle of a baboon. “and what became of the bust?” asked holmes, after a careful study of this picture. “we had news of it just before you came. it has been found in the front garden of an empty house in campden house road. it was broken into fragments. i am going round now to see it. will you come?” “certainly. i must just take one look round.” he examined the carpet and the window. “the fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man,” said he. “with an area beneath, it was no mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window. getting back was comparatively simple. are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust, mr. harker?” the disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table. “i must try and make something of it,” said he, “though i have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details. it’s like my luck! you remember when the stand fell at doncaster? well, i was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for i was too shaken to write it. and now i’ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep.” as we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the foolscap. the spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a few hundred yards away. for the first time our eyes rested upon this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. it lay scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass. holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully. i was convinced, from his intent face and his purposeful manner, that at last he was upon a clue. “well?” asked lestrade. holmes shrugged his shoulders. “we have a long way to go yet,” said he. “and yet—and yet—well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. the possession of this trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange criminal, than a human life. that is one point. then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.” “he was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. he hardly knew what he was doing.” “well, that’s likely enough. but i wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of which the bust was destroyed.” lestrade looked about him. “it was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden.” “yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one. why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?” “i give it up,” said lestrade. holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads. “he could see what he was doing here, and he could not there. that was his reason.” “by jove! that’s true,” said the detective. “now that i come to think of it, dr. barnicot’s bust was broken not far from his red lamp. well, mr. holmes, what are we to do with that fact?” “to remember it—to docket it. we may come on something later which will bear upon it. what steps do you propose to take now, lestrade?” “the most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to identify the dead man. there should be no difficulty about that. when we have found who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of mr. horace harker. don’t you think so?” “no doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which i should approach the case.” “what would you do then?” “oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. i suggest that you go on your line and i on mine. we can compare notes afterwards, and each will supplement the other.” “very good,” said lestrade. “if you are going back to pitt street, you might see mr. horace harker. tell him for me that i have quite made up my mind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. it will be useful for his article.” lestrade stared. “you don’t seriously believe that?” holmes smiled. “don’t i? well, perhaps i don’t. but i am sure that it will interest mr. horace harker and the subscribers of the central press syndicate. now, watson, i think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day’s work before us. i should be glad, lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at baker street at six o’clock this evening. until then i should like to keep this photograph, found in the dead man’s pocket. it is possible that i may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. until then good-bye and good luck!” sherlock holmes and i walked together to the high street, where we stopped at the shop of harding brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. a young assistant informed us that mr. harding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a newcomer, who could give us no information. holmes’s face showed his disappointment and annoyance. “well, well, we can’t expect to have it all our own way, watson,” he said, at last. “we must come back in the afternoon, if mr. harding will not be here until then. i am, as you have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate. let us make for mr. morse hudson, of the kennington road, and see if he can throw any light upon the problem.” a drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer’s establishment. he was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner. “yes, sir. on my very counter, sir,” said he. “what we pay rates and taxes for i don’t know, when any ruffian can come in and break one’s goods. yes, sir, it was i who sold dr. barnicot his two statues. disgraceful, sir! a nihilist plot—that’s what i make it. no one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. red republicans—that’s what i call ’em. who did i get the statues from? i don’t see what that has to do with it. well, if you really want to know, i got them from gelder & co., in church street, stepney. they are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years. how many had i? three—two and one are three—two of dr. barnicot’s, and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. do i know that photograph? no, i don’t. yes, i do, though. why, it’s beppo. he was a kind of italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. he could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. the fellow left me last week, and i’ve heard nothing of him since. no, i don’t know where he came from nor where he went to. i had nothing against him while he was here. he was gone two days before the bust was smashed.” “well, that’s all we could reasonably expect from morse hudson,” said holmes, as we emerged from the shop. “we have this beppo as a common factor, both in kennington and in kensington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. now, watson, let us make for gelder & co., of stepney, the source and origin of the busts. i shall be surprised if we don’t get some help down there.” in rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable london, hotel london, theatrical london, literary london, commercial london, and, finally, maritime london, till we came to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of europe. here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy city merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we searched. outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry. inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. the manager, a big blond german, received us civilly and gave a clear answer to all holmes’s questions. a reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of devine’s head of napoleon, but that the three which had been sent to morse hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to harding brothers, of kensington. there was no reason why those six should be different from any of the other casts. he could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them—in fact, he laughed at the idea. their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. the cast was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of paris were joined together to make the complete bust. the work was usually done by italians, in the room we were in. when finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. that was all he could tell us. but the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the manager. his face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his blue teutonic eyes. “ah, the rascal!” he cried. “yes, indeed, i know him very well. this has always been a respectable establishment, and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow. it was more than a year ago now. he knifed another italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the police on his heels, and he was taken here. beppo was his name—his second name i never knew. serve me right for engaging a man with such a face. but he was a good workman—one of the best.” “what did he get?” “the man lived and he got off with a year. i have no doubt he is out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. we have a cousin of his here, and i daresay he could tell you where he is.” “no, no,” cried holmes, “not a word to the cousin—not a word, i beg of you. the matter is very important, and the farther i go with it, the more important it seems to grow. when you referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts i observed that the date was june 3rd of last year. could you give me the date when beppo was arrested?” “i could tell you roughly by the pay-list,” the manager answered. “yes,” he continued, after some turning over of pages, “he was paid last on may 20th.” “thank you,” said holmes. “i don’t think that i need intrude upon your time and patience any more.” with a last word of caution that he should say nothing as to our researches, we turned our faces westward once more. the afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. a news-bill at the entrance announced “kensington outrage. murder by a madman,” and the contents of the paper showed that mr. horace harker had got his account into print after all. two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident. holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he ate. once or twice he chuckled. “this is all right, watson,” said he. “listen to this: “it is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case, since mr. lestrade, one of the most experienced members of the official force, and mr. sherlock holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. no explanation save mental aberration can cover the facts. “the press, watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only know how to use it. and now, if you have quite finished, we will hark back to kensington and see what the manager of harding brothers has to say on the matter.” the founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue. “yes, sir, i have already read the account in the evening papers. mr. horace harker is a customer of ours. we supplied him with the bust some months ago. we ordered three busts of that sort from gelder & co., of stepney. they are all sold now. to whom? oh, i daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you. yes, we have the entries here. one to mr. harker you see, and one to mr. josiah brown, of laburnum lodge, laburnum vale, chiswick, and one to mr. sandeford, of lower grove road, reading. no, i have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph. you would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for i’ve seldom seen an uglier. have we any italians on the staff? yes, sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. i daresay they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. there is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. well, well, it’s a very strange business, and i hope that you will let me know if anything comes of your inquiries.” holmes had taken several notes during mr. harding’s evidence, and i could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were taking. he made no remark, however, save that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with lestrade. sure enough, when we reached baker street the detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever of impatience. his look of importance showed that his day’s work had not been in vain. “well?” he asked. “what luck, mr. holmes?” “we have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,” my friend explained. “we have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale manufacturers. i can trace each of the busts now from the beginning.” “the busts,” cried lestrade. “well, well, you have your own methods, mr. sherlock holmes, and it is not for me to say a word against them, but i think i have done a better day’s work than you. i have identified the dead man.” “you don’t say so?” “and found a cause for the crime.” “splendid!” “we have an inspector who makes a specialty of saffron hill and the italian quarter. well, this dead man had some catholic emblem round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from the south. inspector hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him. his name is pietro venucci, from naples, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in london. he is connected with the mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. now, you see how the affair begins to clear up. the other fellow is probably an italian also, and a member of the mafia. he has broken the rules in some fashion. pietro is set upon his track. probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. he dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. how is that, mr. sherlock holmes?” holmes clapped his hands approvingly. “excellent, lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “but i didn’t quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.” “the busts! you never can get those busts out of your head. after all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. it is the murder that we are really investigating, and i tell you that i am gathering all the threads into my hands.” “and the next stage?” “is a very simple one. i shall go down with hill to the italian quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on the charge of murder. will you come with us?” “i think not. i fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. i can’t say for certain, because it all depends—well, it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control. but i have great hopes—in fact, the betting is exactly two to one—that if you will come with us to-night i shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels.” “in the italian quarter?” “no, i fancy chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. if you will come with me to chiswick to-night, lestrade, i’ll promise to go to the italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. and now i think that a few hours’ sleep would do us all good, for i do not propose to leave before eleven o’clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. you’ll dine with us, lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. in the meantime, watson, i should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger, for i have a letter to send and it is important that it should go at once.” holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. when at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. for my own part, i had followed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though i could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, i understood clearly that holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, i remembered, was at chiswick. no doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and i could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. i was not surprised when holmes suggested that i should take my revolver with me. he had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his favourite weapon. a four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of hammersmith bridge. here the cabman was directed to wait. a short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. in the light of a street lamp we read “laburnum villa” upon the gate-post of one of them. the occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. the wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we crouched. “i fear that you’ll have a long wait,” holmes whispered. “we may thank our stars that it is not raining. i don’t think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time. however, it’s a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.” it proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. in an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house. there was a long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our ears. the window was being opened. the noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. the fellow was making his way into the house. we saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. what he sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then through another. “let us get to the open window. we will nab him as he climbs out,” lestrade whispered. but before we could move, the man had emerged again. as he came out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried something white under his arm. he looked stealthily all round him. the silence of the deserted street reassured him. turning his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. the man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. with the bound of a tiger holmes was on his back, and an instant later lestrade and i had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had been fastened. as we turned him over i saw a hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and i knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured. but it was not our prisoner to whom holmes was giving his attention. squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house. it was a bust of napoleon, like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments. carefully holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. he had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself. “mr. josiah brown, i suppose?” said holmes. “yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are mr. sherlock holmes? i had the note which you sent by the express messenger, and i did exactly what you told me. we locked every door on the inside and awaited developments. well, i’m very glad to see that you have got the rascal. i hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment.” however, lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon our way to london. not a word would our captive say, but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. we stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood. “that’s all right,” said lestrade, as we parted. “hill knows all these gentry, and he will give a name to him. you’ll find that my theory of the mafia will work out all right. but i’m sure i am exceedingly obliged to you, mr. holmes, for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him. i don’t quite understand it all yet.” “i fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said holmes. “besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end. if you will come round once more to my rooms at six o’clock to-morrow, i think i shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime. if ever i permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems, watson, i foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the napoleonic busts.” when we met again next evening, lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner. his name, it appeared, was beppo, second name unknown. he was a well-known ne’er-do-well among the italian colony. he had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail—once for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. he could talk english perfectly well. his reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of gelder & co. to all this information, much of which we already knew, holmes listened with polite attention, but i, who knew him so well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and i detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume. at last he started in his chair, and his eyes brightened. there had been a ring at the bell. a minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. in his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table. “is mr. sherlock holmes here?” my friend bowed and smiled. “mr. sandeford, of reading, i suppose?” said he. “yes, sir, i fear that i am a little late, but the trains were awkward. you wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.” “exactly.” “i have your letter here. you said, ‘i desire to possess a copy of devine’s napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession.’ is that right?” “certainly.” “i was very much surprised at your letter, for i could not imagine how you knew that i owned such a thing.” “of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very simple. mr. harding, of harding brothers, said that they had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.” “oh, that was it, was it? did he tell you what i paid for it?” “no, he did not.” “well, i am an honest man, though not a very rich one. i only gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and i think you ought to know that before i take ten pounds from you. “i am sure the scruple does you honour, mr. sandeford. but i have named that price, so i intend to stick to it.” “well, it is very handsome of you, mr. holmes. i brought the bust up with me, as you asked me to do. here it is!” he opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments. holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon the table. “you will kindly sign that paper, mr. sandeford, in the presence of these witnesses. it is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. i am a methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. thank you, mr. sandeford; here is your money, and i wish you a very good evening.” when our visitor had disappeared, sherlock holmes’s movements were such as to rivet our attention. he began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head. the figure broke into fragments, and holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding. “gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the borgias.” lestrade and i sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the well-wrought crisis of a play. a flush of colour sprang to holmes’s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. it was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. the same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend. “yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the prince of colonna’s bedroom at the dacre hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of napoleon which were manufactured by gelder & co., of stepney. you will remember, lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the london police to recover it. i was myself consulted upon the case, but i was unable to throw any light upon it. suspicion fell upon the maid of the princess, who was an italian, and it was proved that she had a brother in london, but we failed to trace any connection between them. the maid’s name was lucretia venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother. i have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and i find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of beppo, for some crime of violence—an event which took place in the factory of gelder & co., at the very moment when these busts were being made. now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented themselves to me. beppo had the pearl in his possession. he may have stolen it from pietro, he may have been pietro’s confederate, he may have been the go-between of pietro and his sister. it is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution. “the main fact is that he _had_ the pearl, and at that moment, when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. he made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. six plaster casts of napoleon were drying in the passage. one of them was still soft. in an instant beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more. it was an admirable hiding-place. no one could possibly find it. but beppo was condemned to a year’s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over london. he could not tell which contained his treasure. only by breaking them could he see. even shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it—as, in fact, it has done. beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. through a cousin who works with gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts. he managed to find employment with morse hudson, and in that way tracked down three of them. the pearl was not there. then, with the help of some italian employee, he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone. the first was at harker’s. there he was dogged by his confederate, who held beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed.” “if he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?” i asked. “as a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him from any third person. that was the obvious reason. well, after the murder i calculated that beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements. he would fear that the police would read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. of course, i could not say that he had not found the pearl in harker’s bust. i had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it. since harker’s bust was one in three, the chances were exactly as i told you—two to one against the pearl being inside it. there remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the london one first. i warned the inmates of the house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest results. by that time, of course, i knew for certain that it was the borgia pearl that we were after. the name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other. there only remained a single bust—the reading one—and the pearl must be there. i bought it in your presence from the owner—and there it lies.” we sat in silence for a moment. “well,” said lestrade, “i’ve seen you handle a good many cases, mr. holmes, but i don’t know that i ever knew a more workmanlike one than that. we’re not jealous of you at scotland yard. no, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow, there’s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn’t be glad to shake you by the hand.” “thank you!” said holmes. “thank you!” and as he turned away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than i had ever seen him. a moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more. “put the pearl in the safe, watson,” said he, “and get out the papers of the conk-singleton forgery case. good-bye, lestrade. if any little problem comes your way, i shall be happy, if i can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution.” the adventure of the three students it was in the year ’95 that a combination of events, into which i need not enter, caused mr. sherlock holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns, and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which i am about to relate befell us. it will be obvious that any details which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive. so painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out. with due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. i will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned. we were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where sherlock holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early english charters—researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, mr. hilton soames, tutor and lecturer at the college of st. luke’s. mr. soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. i had always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred. “i trust, mr. holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time. we have had a very painful incident at st. luke’s, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in town, i should have been at a loss what to do.” “i am very busy just now, and i desire no distractions,” my friend answered. “i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police.” “no, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. when once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to avoid scandal. your discretion is as well-known as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. i beg you, mr. holmes, to do what you can.” my friend’s temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street. without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story. “i must explain to you, mr. holmes, that to-morrow is the first day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship. i am one of the examiners. my subject is greek, and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of greek translation which the candidate has not seen. this passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance. for this reason, great care is taken to keep the paper secret. “to-day, about three o’clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers. the exercise consists of half a chapter of thucydides. i had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct. at four-thirty my task was not yet completed. i had, however, promised to take tea in a friend’s rooms, so i left the proof upon my desk. i was absent rather more than an hour. “you are aware, mr. holmes, that our college doors are double—a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. as i approached my outer door, i was amazed to see a key in it. for an instant i imagined that i had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket i found that it was all right. the only duplicate which existed, so far as i knew, was that which belonged to my servant, bannister—a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. i found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if i wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. his visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. his forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences. “the moment i looked at my table, i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. the proof was in three long slips. i had left them all together. now, i found that one of them was lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third was where i had left it.” holmes stirred for the first time. “the first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it,” said he. “exactly, mr. holmes. you amaze me. how could you possibly know that?” “pray continue your very interesting statement.” “for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers. he denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and i am convinced that he was speaking the truth. the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that i was out, and had entered to look at the papers. a large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows. “bannister was very much upset by the incident. he had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while i made a most careful examination of the room. i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers. on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. a broken tip of lead was lying there also. evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it.” “excellent!” said holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case. “fortune has been your friend.” “this was not all. i have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red leather. i am prepared to swear, and so is bannister, that it was smooth and unstained. now i found a clean cut in it about three inches long—not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. not only this, but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. i was at my wits’ end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and i came straight round to put the matter into your hands. do help me, mr. holmes. you see my dilemma. either i must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation, there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not only on the college, but on the university. above all things, i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.” “i shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as i can,” said holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. “the case is not entirely devoid of interest. had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you?” “yes, young daulat ras, an indian student, who lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination.” “for which he was entered?” “yes.” “and the papers were on your table?” “to the best of my belief, they were rolled up.” “but might be recognized as proofs?” “possibly.” “no one else in your room?” “no.” “did anyone know that these proofs would be there?” “no one save the printer.” “did this man bannister know?” “no, certainly not. no one knew.” “where is bannister now?” “he was very ill, poor fellow. i left him collapsed in the chair. i was in such a hurry to come to you.” “you left your door open?” “i locked up the papers first.” “then it amounts to this, mr. soames: that, unless the indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there.” “so it seems to me.” holmes gave an enigmatic smile. “well,” said he, “let us go round. not one of your cases, watson—mental, not physical. all right; come if you want to. now, mr. soames—at your disposal!” the sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college. a gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. on the ground floor was the tutor’s room. above were three students, one on each story. it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem. holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window. then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room. “he must have entered through the door. there is no opening except the one pane,” said our learned guide. “dear me!” said holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion. “well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside.” the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room. we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination of the carpet. “i am afraid there are no signs here,” said he. “one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day. your servant seems to have quite recovered. you left him in a chair, you say. which chair?” “by the window there.” “i see. near this little table. you can come in now. i have finished with the carpet. let us take the little table first. of course, what has happened is very clear. the man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. he carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.” “as a matter of fact, he could not,” said soames, “for i entered by the side door.” “ah, that’s good! well, anyhow, that was in his mind. let me see the three strips. no finger impressions—no! well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it. how long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction? a quarter of an hour, not less. then he tossed it down and seized the next. he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat—_very_ hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there. you were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?” “no, i can’t say i was.” “well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again. this is of interest, watson. the pencil was not an ordinary one. it was above the usual size, with a soft lead, the outer colour was dark blue, the maker’s name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long. look for such a pencil, mr. soames, and you have got your man. when i add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an additional aid.” mr. soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information. “i can follow the other points,” said he, “but really, in this matter of the length——” holmes held out a small chip with the letters nn and a space of clear wood after them. “you see?” “no, i fear that even now——” “watson, i have always done you an injustice. there are others. what could this nn be? it is at the end of a word. you are aware that johann faber is the most common maker’s name. is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann?” he held the small table sideways to the electric light. “i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. no, i see nothing. i don’t think there is anything more to be learned here. now for the central table. this small pellet is, i presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of. roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, i perceive. as you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. dear me, this is very interesting. and the cut—a positive tear, i see. it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. i am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, mr. soames. where does that door lead to?” “to my bedroom.” “have you been in it since your adventure?” “no, i came straight away for you.” “i should like to have a glance round. what a charming, old-fashioned room! perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until i have examined the floor. no, i see nothing. what about this curtain? you hang your clothes behind it. if anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. no one there, i suppose?” as holmes drew the curtain i was aware, from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency. as a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs. holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor. “halloa! what’s this?” said he. it was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study. holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light. “your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting-room, mr. soames.” “what could he have wanted there?” “i think it is clear enough. you came back by an unexpected way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door. what could he do? he caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.” “good gracious, mr. holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time i was talking to bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?” “so i read it.” “surely there is another alternative, mr. holmes. i don’t know whether you observed my bedroom window?” “lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man.” “exactly. and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible. the man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way.” holmes shook his head impatiently. “let us be practical,” said he. “i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door?” “yes, there are.” “and they are all in for this examination?” “yes.” “have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others?” soames hesitated. “it is a very delicate question,” said he. “one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs.” “let us hear the suspicions. i will look after the proofs.” “i will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms. the lower of the three is gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump. he is a fine, manly fellow. his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. my scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious. he will do well. “the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras, the indian. he is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those indians are. he is well up in his work, though his greek is his weak subject. he is steady and methodical. “the top floor belongs to miles mclaren. he is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work—one of the brightest intellects of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. he was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year. he has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination.” “then it is he whom you suspect?” “i dare not go so far as that. but, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely.” “exactly. now, mr. soames, let us have a look at your servant, bannister.” he was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fellow of fifty. he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life. his plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still. “we are investigating this unhappy business, bannister,” said his master. “yes, sir.” “i understand,” said holmes, “that you left your key in the door?” “yes, sir.” “was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?” “it was most unfortunate, sir. but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times.” “when did you enter the room?” “it was about half-past four. that is mr. soames’ tea time.” “how long did you stay?” “when i saw that he was absent, i withdrew at once.” “did you look at these papers on the table?” “no, sir—certainly not.” “how came you to leave the key in the door?” “i had the tea-tray in my hand. i thought i would come back for the key. then i forgot.” “has the outer door a spring lock?” “no, sir.” “then it was open all the time?” “yes, sir.” “anyone in the room could get out?” “yes, sir.” “when mr. soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?” “yes, sir. such a thing has never happened during the many years that i have been here. i nearly fainted, sir.” “so i understand. where were you when you began to feel bad?” “where was i, sir? why, here, near the door.” “that is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner. why did you pass these other chairs?” “i don’t know, sir, it didn’t matter to me where i sat.” “i really don’t think he knew much about it, mr. holmes. he was looking very bad—quite ghastly.” “you stayed here when your master left?” “only for a minute or so. then i locked the door and went to my room.” “whom do you suspect?” “oh, i would not venture to say, sir. i don’t believe there is any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an action. no, sir, i’ll not believe it.” “thank you, that will do,” said holmes. “oh, one more word. you have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss?” “no, sir—not a word.” “you haven’t seen any of them?” “no, sir.” “very good. now, mr. soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please.” three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom. “your three birds are all in their nests,” said holmes, looking up. “halloa! what’s that? one of them seems restless enough.” it was the indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind. he was pacing swiftly up and down his room. “i should like to have a peep at each of them,” said holmes. “is it possible?” “no difficulty in the world,” soames answered. “this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them. come along, and i will personally conduct you.” “no names, please!” said holmes, as we knocked at gilchrist’s door. a tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand. there were some really curious pieces of mediæval domestic architecture within. holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own. the same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the indian—a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance, and was obviously glad when holmes’s architectural studies had come to an end. i could not see that in either case holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching. only at the third did our visit prove abortive. the outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it. “i don’t care who you are. you can go to blazes!” roared the angry voice. “tomorrow’s the exam, and i won’t be drawn by anyone.” “a rude fellow,” said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair. “of course, he did not realize that it was i who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious.” holmes’s response was a curious one. “can you tell me his exact height?” he asked. “really, mr. holmes, i cannot undertake to say. he is taller than the indian, not so tall as gilchrist. i suppose five foot six would be about it.” “that is very important,” said holmes. “and now, mr. soames, i wish you good-night.” our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. “good gracious, mr. holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion! you don’t seem to realize the position. to-morrow is the examination. i must take some definite action to-night. i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. the situation must be faced.” “you must leave it as it is. i shall drop round early to-morrow morning and chat the matter over. it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action. meanwhile, you change nothing—nothing at all.” “very good, mr. holmes.” “you can be perfectly easy in your mind. we shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties. i will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. good-bye.” when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows. the indian still paced his room. the others were invisible. “well, watson, what do you think of it?” holmes asked, as we came out into the main street. “quite a little parlour game—sort of three-card trick, is it not? there are your three men. it must be one of them. you take your choice. which is yours?” “the foul-mouthed fellow at the top. he is the one with the worst record. and yet that indian was a sly fellow also. why should he be pacing his room all the time?” “there is nothing in that. many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart.” “he looked at us in a queer way.” “so would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of value. no, i see nothing in that. pencils, too, and knives—all was satisfactory. but that fellow _does_ puzzle me.” “who?” “why, bannister, the servant. what’s his game in the matter?” “he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.” “so he did me. that’s the puzzling part. why should a perfectly honest man—well, well, here’s a large stationer’s. we shall begin our researches here.” there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate. all were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock. my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation. “no good, my dear watson. this, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing. but, indeed, i have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it. by jove! my dear fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty. what with your eternal tobacco, watson, and your irregularity at meals, i expect that you will get notice to quit, and that i shall share your downfall—not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students.” holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. at eight in the morning, he came into my room just as i finished my toilet. “well, watson,” said he, “it is time we went down to st. luke’s. can you do without breakfast?” “certainly.” “soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive.” “have you anything positive to tell him?” “i think so.” “you have formed a conclusion?” “yes, my dear watson, i have solved the mystery.” “but what fresh evidence could you have got?” “aha! it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six. i have put in two hours’ hard work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for it. look at that!” he held out his hand. on the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay. “why, holmes, you had only two yesterday.” “and one more this morning. it is a fair argument that wherever no. 3 came from is also the source of nos. 1 and 2. eh, watson? well, come along and put friend soames out of his pain.” the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers. in a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched. “thank heaven that you have come! i feared that you had given it up in despair. what am i to do? shall the examination proceed?” “yes, let it proceed, by all means.” “but this rascal--?” “he shall not compete.” “you know him?” “i think so. if this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial. you there, if you please, soames! watson, you here! i’ll take the armchair in the middle. i think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast. kindly ring the bell!” bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance. “you will kindly close the door,” said holmes. “now, bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday’s incident?” the man turned white to the roots of his hair. “i have told you everything, sir.” “nothing to add?” “nothing at all, sir.” “well, then, i must make some suggestions to you. when you sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room?” bannister’s face was ghastly. “no, sir, certainly not.” “it is only a suggestion,” said holmes, suavely. “i frankly admit that i am unable to prove it. but it seems probable enough, since the moment that mr. soames’s back was turned, you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom.” bannister licked his dry lips. “there was no man, sir.” “ah, that’s a pity, bannister. up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now i know that you have lied.” the man’s face set in sullen defiance. “there was no man, sir.” “come, come, bannister!” “no, sir, there was no one.” “in that case, you can give us no further information. would you please remain in the room? stand over there near the bedroom door. now, soames, i am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young gilchrist, and to ask him to step down into yours.” an instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student. he was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face. his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner. “just close the door,” said holmes. “now, mr. gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us. we can be perfectly frank with each other. we want to know, mr. gilchrist, how you, an honourable man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?” the unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannister. “no, no, mr. gilchrist, sir, i never said a word—never one word!” cried the servant. “no, but you have now,” said holmes. “now, sir, you must see that after bannister’s words your position is hopeless, and that your only chance lies in a frank confession.” for a moment gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features. the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing. “come, come,” said holmes, kindly, “it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal. perhaps it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr. soames what occurred, and you can check me where i am wrong. shall i do so? well, well, don’t trouble to answer. listen, and see that i do you no injustice. “from the moment, mr. soames, that you said to me that no one, not even bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind. the printer one could, of course, dismiss. he could examine the papers in his own office. the indian i also thought nothing of. if the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they were. on the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table. i dismissed that. the man who entered knew that the papers were there. how did he know? “when i approached your room, i examined the window. you amused me by supposing that i was contemplating the possibility of someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these opposite rooms, forced himself through it. such an idea was absurd. i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table. i am six feet high, and i could do it with an effort. no one less than that would have a chance. already you see i had reason to think that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual height, he was the most worth watching of the three. “i entered, and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table. of the centre table i could make nothing, until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper. then the whole thing came to me in an instant, and i only needed certain corroborative proofs, which i speedily obtained. “what happened was this. this young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practising the jump. he returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. as he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. no harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant. a sudden impulse came over him to enter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. it was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question. “well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation. he put his shoes on the table. what was it you put on that chair near the window?” “gloves,” said the young man. holmes looked triumphantly at bannister. “he put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him. as we know, he came back by the side gate. suddenly he heard him at the very door. there was no possible escape. he forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom. you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door. that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken refuge there. the earth round the spike had been left on the table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom. i may add that i walked out to the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping. have i told the truth, mr. gilchrist?” the student had drawn himself erect. “yes, sir, it is true,” said he. “good heavens! have you nothing to add?” cried soames. “yes, sir, i have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me. i have a letter here, mr. soames, which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night. it was before i knew that my sin had found me out. here it is, sir. you will see that i have said, ‘i have determined not to go in for the examination. i have been offered a commission in the rhodesian police, and i am going out to south africa at once.’” “i am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage,” said soames. “but why did you change your purpose?” gilchrist pointed to bannister. “there is the man who set me in the right path,” said he. “come now, bannister,” said holmes. “it will be clear to you, from what i have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out. as to his escaping by that window, it was incredible. can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?” “it was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with all your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know. time was, sir, when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist, this young gentleman’s father. when he was ruined i came to the college as servant, but i never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world. i watched his son all i could for the sake of the old days. well, sir, when i came into this room yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing i saw was mr. gilchrist’s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. i knew those gloves well, and i understood their message. if mr. soames saw them, the game was up. i flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until mr. soames he went for you. then out came my poor young master, whom i had dandled on my knee, and confessed it all to me. wasn’t it natural, sir, that i should save him, and wasn’t it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed? could you blame me, sir?” “no, indeed,” said holmes, heartily, springing to his feet. “well, soames, i think we have cleared your little problem up, and our breakfast awaits us at home. come, watson! as to you, sir, i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia. for once you have fallen low. let us see, in the future, how high you can rise.” the adventure of the golden pince-nez when i look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year 1894, i confess that it is very difficult for me, out of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves, and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. as i turn over the pages, i see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of crosby, the banker. here also i find an account of the addleton tragedy, and the singular contents of the ancient british barrow. the famous smith-mortimer succession case comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of huret, the boulevard assassin—an exploit which won for holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the french president and the order of the legion of honour. each of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole i am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of interest as the episode of yoxley old place, which includes not only the lamentable death of young willoughby smith, but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime. it was a wild, tempestuous night, towards the close of november. holmes and i sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest, i deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. outside the wind howled down baker street, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. it was strange there, in the very depths of the town, with ten miles of man’s handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of nature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all london was no more than the molehills that dot the fields. i walked to the window, and looked out on the deserted street. the occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement. a single cab was splashing its way from the oxford street end. “well, watson, it’s as well we have not to turn out to-night,” said holmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest. “i’ve done enough for one sitting. it is trying work for the eyes. so far as i can make out, it is nothing more exciting than an abbey’s accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century. halloa! halloa! halloa! what’s this?” amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse’s hoofs, and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb. the cab which i had seen had pulled up at our door. “what can he want?” i ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it. “want? he wants us. and we, my poor watson, want overcoats and cravats and goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather. wait a bit, though! there’s the cab off again! there’s hope yet. he’d have kept it if he had wanted us to come. run down, my dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.” when the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor, i had no difficulty in recognizing him. it was young stanley hopkins, a promising detective, in whose career holmes had several times shown a very practical interest. “is he in?” he asked, eagerly. “come up, my dear sir,” said holmes’s voice from above. “i hope you have no designs upon us such a night as this.” the detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof. i helped him out of it, while holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate. “now, my dear hopkins, draw up and warm your toes,” said he. “here’s a cigar, and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon, which is good medicine on a night like this. it must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale.” “it is indeed, mr. holmes. i’ve had a bustling afternoon, i promise you. did you see anything of the yoxley case in the latest editions?” “i’ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day.” “well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong at that, so you have not missed anything. i haven’t let the grass grow under my feet. it’s down in kent, seven miles from chatham and three from the railway line. i was wired for at 3:15, reached yoxley old place at 5, conducted my investigation, was back at charing cross by the last train, and straight to you by cab.” “which means, i suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?” “it means that i can make neither head nor tail of it. so far as i can see, it is just as tangled a business as ever i handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn’t go wrong. there’s no motive, mr. holmes. that’s what bothers me—i can’t put my hand on a motive. here’s a man dead—there’s no denying that—but, so far as i can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.” holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair. “let us hear about it,” said he. “i’ve got my facts pretty clear,” said stanley hopkins. “all i want now is to know what they all mean. the story, so far as i can make it out, is like this. some years ago this country house, yoxley old place, was taken by an elderly man, who gave the name of professor coram. he was an invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath chair. he was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man. his household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, mrs. marker, and of a maid, susan tarlton. these have both been with him since his arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent character. the professor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary, about a year ago, to engage a secretary. the first two that he tried were not successes, but the third, mr. willoughby smith, a very young man straight from the university, seems to have been just what his employer wanted. his work consisted in writing all the morning to the professor’s dictation, and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day’s work. this willoughby smith has nothing against him, either as a boy at uppingham or as a young man at cambridge. i have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hard-working fellow, with no weak spot in him at all. and yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the professor’s study under circumstances which can point only to murder.” the wind howled and screamed at the windows. holmes and i drew closer to the fire, while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative. “if you were to search all england,” said he, “i don’t suppose you could find a household more self-contained or freer from outside influences. whole weeks would pass, and not one of them go past the garden gate. the professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else. young smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood, and lived very much as his employer did. the two women had nothing to take them from the house. mortimer, the gardener, who wheels the bath chair, is an army pensioner—an old crimean man of excellent character. he does not live in the house, but in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the garden. those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of yoxley old place. at the same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main london to chatham road. it opens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in. “now i will give you the evidence of susan tarlton, who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter. it was in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve. she was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom. professor coram was still in bed, for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday. the housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house. willoughby smith had been in his bedroom, which he uses as a sitting-room, but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her. she did not see him, but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick, firm tread. she did not hear the study door close, but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below. it was a wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a man or a woman. at the same instant there was a heavy thud, which shook the old house, and then all was silence. the maid stood petrified for a moment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. the study door was shut and she opened it. inside, young mr. willoughby smith was stretched upon the floor. at first she could see no injury, but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of his neck. it was pierced by a very small but very deep wound, which had divided the carotid artery. the instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. it was one of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing-tables, with an ivory handle and a stiff blade. it was part of the fittings of the professor’s own desk. “at first the maid thought that young smith was already dead, but on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened his eyes for an instant. ‘the professor,’ he murmured—‘it was she.’ the maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words. he tried desperately to say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air. then he fell back dead. “in the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene, but she was just too late to catch the young man’s dying words. leaving susan with the body, she hurried to the professor’s room. he was sitting up in bed, horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred. mrs. marker is prepared to swear that the professor was still in his night-clothes, and indeed it was impossible for him to dress without the help of mortimer, whose orders were to come at twelve o’clock. the professor declares that he heard the distant cry, but that he knows nothing more. he can give no explanation of the young man’s last words, ‘the professor—it was she,’ but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium. he believes that willoughby smith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the crime. his first action was to send mortimer, the gardener, for the local police. a little later the chief constable sent for me. nothing was moved before i got there, and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house. it was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, mr. sherlock holmes. there was really nothing wanting.” “except mr. sherlock holmes,” said my companion, with a somewhat bitter smile. “well, let us hear about it. what sort of a job did you make of it?” “i must ask you first, mr. holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which will give you a general idea of the position of the professor’s study and the various points of the case. it will help you in following my investigation.” he unfolded the rough chart, which i here reproduce, and he laid it across holmes’s knee. i rose and, standing behind holmes, studied it over his shoulder. professor's-study “it is very rough, of course, and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential. all the rest you will see later for yourself. now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did he or she come in? undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door, from which there is direct access to the study. any other way would have been exceedingly complicated. the escape must have also been made along that line, for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the professor’s bedroom. i therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path, which was saturated with recent rain, and would certainly show any footmarks. “my examination showed me that i was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. no footmarks were to be found on the path. there could be no question, however, that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path, and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track. i could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden down, and someone had undoubtedly passed. it could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning, and the rain had only begun during the night.” “one moment,” said holmes. “where does this path lead to?” “to the road.” “how long is it?” “a hundred yards or so.” “at the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely pick up the tracks?” “unfortunately, the path was tiled at that point.” “well, on the road itself?” “no, it was all trodden into mire.” “tut-tut! well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?” “it was impossible to say. there was never any outline.” “a large foot or a small?” “you could not distinguish.” holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience. “it has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since,” said he. “it will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. well, well, it can’t be helped. what did you do, hopkins, after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?” “i think i made certain of a good deal, mr. holmes. i knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. i next examined the corridor. it is lined with cocoanut matting and had taken no impression of any kind. this brought me into the study itself. it is a scantily furnished room. the main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau. this bureau consists of a double column of drawers, with a central small cupboard between them. the drawers were open, the cupboard locked. the drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. there were some papers of importance in the cupboard, but there were no signs that this had been tampered with, and the professor assures me that nothing was missing. it is certain that no robbery has been committed. “i come now to the body of the young man. it was found near the bureau, and just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. the stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forward, so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self-inflicted.” “unless he fell upon the knife,” said holmes. “exactly. the idea crossed my mind. but we found the knife some feet away from the body, so that seems impossible. then, of course, there are the man’s own dying words. and, finally, there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man’s right hand.” from his pocket stanley hopkins drew a small paper packet. he unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it. “willoughby smith had excellent sight,” he added. “there can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin.” sherlock holmes took the glasses into his hand, and examined them with the utmost attention and interest. he held them on his nose, endeavoured to read through them, went to the window and stared up the street with them, looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across to stanley hopkins. “that’s the best i can do for you,” said he. “it may prove to be of some use.” the astonished detective read the note aloud. it ran as follows: “wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. she has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. she has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. there are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. as her glasses are of remarkable strength, and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.” holmes smiled at the astonishment of hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features. “surely my deductions are simplicity itself,” said he. “it would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as these. that they belong to a woman i infer from their delicacy, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying man. as to her being a person of refinement and well dressed, they are, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects. you will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, showing that the lady’s nose was very broad at the base. this sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there is a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description. my own face is a narrow one, and yet i find that i cannot get my eyes into the centre, nor near the centre, of these glasses. therefore, the lady’s eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose. you will perceive, watson, that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength. a lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders.” “yes,” i said, “i can follow each of your arguments. i confess, however, that i am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician.” holmes took the glasses in his hand. “you will perceive,” he said, “that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. one of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new. evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. i should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months. they exactly correspond, so i gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second.” “by george, it’s marvellous!” cried hopkins, in an ecstasy of admiration. “to think that i had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it! i had intended, however, to go the round of the london opticians.” “of course you would. meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?” “nothing, mr. holmes. i think that you know as much as i do now—probably more. we have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station. we have heard of none. what beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest.” “ah! there i am not in a position to help you. but i suppose you want us to come out to-morrow?” “if it is not asking too much, mr. holmes. there’s a train from charing cross to chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at yoxley old place between eight and nine.” “then we shall take it. your case has certainly some features of great interest, and i shall be delighted to look into it. well, it’s nearly one, and we had best get a few hours’ sleep. i daresay you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. i’ll light my spirit lamp, and give you a cup of coffee before we start.” the gale had blown itself out next day, but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey. we saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river, which i shall ever associate with our pursuit of the andaman islander in the earlier days of our career. after a long and weary journey, we alighted at a small station some miles from chatham. while a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn, we snatched a hurried breakfast, and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at yoxley old place. a constable met us at the garden gate. “well, wilson, any news?” “no, sir—nothing.” “no reports of any stranger seen?” “no, sir. down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday.” “have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?” “yes, sir: there is no one that we cannot account for.” “well, it’s only a reasonable walk to chatham. anyone might stay there or take a train without being observed. this is the garden path of which i spoke, mr. holmes. i’ll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday.” “on which side were the marks on the grass?” “this side, sir. this narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower-bed. i can’t see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.” “yes, yes: someone has passed along,” said holmes, stooping over the grass border. “our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?” “yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.” i saw an intent look pass over holmes’s face. “you say that she must have come back this way?” “yes, sir, there is no other.” “on this strip of grass?” “certainly, mr. holmes.” “hum! it was a very remarkable performance—very remarkable. well, i think we have exhausted the path. let us go farther. this garden door is usually kept open, i suppose? then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. the idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to pick this knife off the writing-table. she advanced along this corridor, leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting. then she found herself in this study. how long was she there? we have no means of judging.” “not more than a few minutes, sir. i forgot to tell you that mrs. marker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very long before—about a quarter of an hour, she says.” “well, that gives us a limit. our lady enters this room, and what does she do? she goes over to the writing-table. what for? not for anything in the drawers. if there had been anything worth her taking, it would surely have been locked up. no, it was for something in that wooden bureau. halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it? just hold a match, watson. why did you not tell me of this, hopkins?” the mark which he was examining began upon the brass-work on the right-hand side of the keyhole, and extended for about four inches, where it had scratched the varnish from the surface. “i noticed it, mr. holmes, but you’ll always find scratches round a keyhole.” “this is recent, quite recent. see how the brass shines where it is cut. an old scratch would be the same colour as the surface. look at it through my lens. there’s the varnish, too, like earth on each side of a furrow. is mrs. marker there?” a sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room. “did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?” “yes, sir.” “did you notice this scratch?” “no, sir, i did not.” “i am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish. who has the key of this bureau?” “the professor keeps it on his watch-chain.” “is it a simple key?” “no, sir, it is a chubb’s key.” “very good. mrs. marker, you can go. now we are making a little progress. our lady enters the room, advances to the bureau, and either opens it or tries to do so. while she is thus engaged, young willoughby smith enters the room. in her hurry to withdraw the key, she makes this scratch upon the door. he seizes her, and she, snatching up the nearest object, which happens to be this knife, strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold. the blow is a fatal one. he falls and she escapes, either with or without the object for which she has come. is susan, the maid, there? could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry, susan?” “no, sir, it is impossible. before i got down the stair, i’d have seen anyone in the passage. besides, the door never opened, or i would have heard it.” “that settles this exit. then no doubt the lady went out the way she came. i understand that this other passage leads only to the professor’s room. there is no exit that way?” “no, sir.” “we shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor. halloa, hopkins! this is very important, very important indeed. the professor’s corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting.” “well, sir, what of that?” “don’t you see any bearing upon the case? well, well. i don’t insist upon it. no doubt i am wrong. and yet it seems to me to be suggestive. come with me and introduce me.” we passed down the passage, which was of the same length as that which led to the garden. at the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door. our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the professor’s bedroom. it was a very large chamber, lined with innumerable volumes, which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were stacked all round at the base of the cases. the bed was in the centre of the room, and in it, propped up with pillows, was the owner of the house. i have seldom seen a more remarkable-looking person. it was a gaunt, aquiline face which was turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes, which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows. his hair and beard were white, save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth. a cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair, and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco smoke. as he held out his hand to holmes, i perceived that it was also stained with yellow nicotine. “a smoker, mr. holmes?” said he, speaking in well-chosen english, with a curious little mincing accent. “pray take a cigarette. and you, sir? i can recommend them, for i have them especially prepared by ionides, of alexandria. he sends me a thousand at a time, and i grieve to say that i have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. bad, sir, very bad, but an old man has few pleasures. tobacco and my work—that is all that is left to me.” holmes had lit a cigarette and was shooting little darting glances all over the room. “tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,” the old man exclaimed. “alas! what a fatal interruption! who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe? so estimable a young man! i assure you that, after a few months’ training, he was an admirable assistant. what do you think of the matter, mr. holmes?” “i have not yet made up my mind.” “i shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us. to a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralysing. i seem to have lost the faculty of thought. but you are a man of action—you are a man of affairs. it is part of the everyday routine of your life. you can preserve your balance in every emergency. we are fortunate, indeed, in having you at our side.” holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old professor was talking. i observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. it was evident that he shared our host’s liking for the fresh alexandrian cigarettes. “yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,” said the old man. “that is my _magnum opus_—the pile of papers on the side table yonder. it is my analysis of the documents found in the coptic monasteries of syria and egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion. with my enfeebled health i do not know whether i shall ever be able to complete it, now that my assistant has been taken from me. dear me! mr. holmes, why, you are even a quicker smoker than i am myself.” holmes smiled. “i am a connoisseur,” said he, taking another cigarette from the box—his fourth—and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished. “i will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination, professor coram, since i gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime, and could know nothing about it. i would only ask this: what do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words: ‘the professor—it was she’?” the professor shook his head. “susan is a country girl,” said he, “and you know the incredible stupidity of that class. i fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into this meaningless message.” “i see. you have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?” “possibly an accident, possibly—i only breathe it among ourselves—a suicide. young men have their hidden troubles—some affair of the heart, perhaps, which we have never known. it is a more probable supposition than murder.” “but the eyeglasses?” “ah! i am only a student—a man of dreams. i cannot explain the practical things of life. but still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may take strange shapes. by all means take another cigarette. it is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. a fan, a glove, glasses—who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life? this gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass, but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point. as to the knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell. it is possible that i speak as a child, but to me it seems that willoughby smith has met his fate by his own hand.” holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued to walk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming cigarette after cigarette. “tell me, professor coram,” he said, at last, “what is in that cupboard in the bureau?” “nothing that would help a thief. family papers, letters from my poor wife, diplomas of universities which have done me honour. here is the key. you can look for yourself.” holmes picked up the key, and looked at it for an instant, then he handed it back. “no, i hardly think that it would help me,” said he. “i should prefer to go quietly down to your garden, and turn the whole matter over in my head. there is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward. we must apologize for having intruded upon you, professor coram, and i promise that we won’t disturb you until after lunch. at two o’clock we will come again, and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval.” holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence. “have you a clue?” i asked, at last. “it depends upon those cigarettes that i smoked,” said he. “it is possible that i am utterly mistaken. the cigarettes will show me.” “my dear holmes,” i exclaimed, “how on earth——” “well, well, you may see for yourself. if not, there’s no harm done. of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but i take a short cut when i can get it. ah, here is the good mrs. marker! let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.” i may have remarked before that holmes had, when he liked, a peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them. in half the time which he had named, he had captured the housekeeper’s goodwill and was chatting with her as if he had known her for years. “yes, mr. holmes, it is as you say, sir. he does smoke something terrible. all day and sometimes all night, sir. i’ve seen that room of a morning—well, sir, you’d have thought it was a london fog. poor young mr. smith, he was a smoker also, but not as bad as the professor. his health—well, i don’t know that it’s better nor worse for the smoking.” “ah!” said holmes, “but it kills the appetite.” “well, i don’t know about that, sir.” “i suppose the professor eats hardly anything?” “well, he is variable. i’ll say that for him.” “i’ll wager he took no breakfast this morning, and won’t face his lunch after all the cigarettes i saw him consume.” “well, you’re out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning. i don’t know when i’ve known him make a better one, and he’s ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. i’m surprised myself, for since i came into that room yesterday and saw young mr. smith lying there on the floor, i couldn’t bear to look at food. well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the professor hasn’t let it take his appetite away.” we loitered the morning away in the garden. stanley hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the chatham road the previous morning. as to my friend, all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. i had never known him handle a case in such a half-hearted fashion. even the news brought back by hopkins that he had found the children, and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with holmes’s description, and wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses, failed to rouse any sign of keen interest. he was more attentive when susan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered the information that she believed mr. smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred. i could not myself see the bearing of this incident, but i clearly perceived that holmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain. suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch. “two o’clock, gentlemen,” said he. “we must go up and have it out with our friend, the professor.” the old man had just finished his lunch, and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had credited him. he was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us. the eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth. he had been dressed and was seated in an armchair by the fire. “well, mr. holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?” he shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion. holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment, and between them they tipped the box over the edge. for a minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places. when we rose again, i observed holmes’s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour. only at a crisis have i seen those battle-signals flying. “yes,” said he, “i have solved it.” stanley hopkins and i stared in amazement. something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt features of the old professor. “indeed! in the garden?” “no, here.” “here! when?” “this instant.” “you are surely joking, mr. sherlock holmes. you compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion.” “i have forged and tested every link of my chain, professor coram, and i am sure that it is sound. what your motives are, or what exact part you play in this strange business, i am not yet able to say. in a few minutes i shall probably hear it from your own lips. meanwhile i will reconstruct what is past for your benefit, so that you may know the information which i still require. “a lady yesterday entered your study. she came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. she had a key of her own. i have had an opportunity of examining yours, and i do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced. you were not an accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as i can read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob you.” the professor blew a cloud from his lips. “this is most interesting and instructive,” said he. “have you no more to add? surely, having traced this lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.” “i will endeavour to do so. in the first place she was seized by your secretary, and stabbed him in order to escape. this catastrophe i am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident, for i am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury. an assassin does not come unarmed. horrified by what she had done, she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy. unfortunately for her, she had lost her glasses in the scuffle, and as she was extremely short-sighted she was really helpless without them. she ran down a corridor, which she imagined to be that by which she had come—both were lined with cocoanut matting—and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage, and that her retreat was cut off behind her. what was she to do? she could not go back. she could not remain where she was. she must go on. she went on. she mounted a stair, pushed open a door, and found herself in your room.” the old man sat with his mouth open, staring wildly at holmes. amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features. now, with an effort, he shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter. “all very fine, mr. holmes,” said he. “but there is one little flaw in your splendid theory. i was myself in my room, and i never left it during the day.” “i am aware of that, professor coram.” “and you mean to say that i could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room?” “i never said so. you _were_ aware of it. you spoke with her. you recognized her. you aided her to escape.” again the professor burst into high-keyed laughter. he had risen to his feet, and his eyes glowed like embers. “you are mad!” he cried. “you are talking insanely. i helped her to escape? where is she now?” “she is there,” said holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room. i saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face, and he fell back in his chair. at the same instant the bookcase at which holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room. “you are right!” she cried, in a strange foreign voice. “you are right! i am here.” she was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come from the walls of her hiding-place. her face, too, was streaked with grime, and at the best she could never have been handsome, for she had the exact physical characteristics which holmes had divined, with, in addition, a long and obstinate chin. what with her natural blindness, and what with the change from dark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking about her to see where and who we were. and yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman’s bearing—a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which compelled something of respect and admiration. stanley hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him aside gently, and yet with an over-mastering dignity which compelled obedience. the old man lay back in his chair with a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes. “yes, sir, i am your prisoner,” she said. “from where i stood i could hear everything, and i know that you have learned the truth. i confess it all. it was i who killed the young man. but you are right—you who say it was an accident. i did not even know that it was a knife which i held in my hand, for in my despair i snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go. it is the truth that i tell.” “madam,” said holmes, “i am sure that it is the truth. i fear that you are far from well.” she had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark dust-streaks upon her face. she seated herself on the side of the bed; then she resumed. “i have only a little time here,” she said, “but i would have you to know the whole truth. i am this man’s wife. he is not an englishman. he is a russian. his name i will not tell.” for the first time the old man stirred. “god bless you, anna!” he cried. “god bless you!” she cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction. “why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours, sergius?” said she. “it has done harm to many and good to none—not even to yourself. however, it is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before god’s time. i have enough already upon my soul since i crossed the threshold of this cursed house. but i must speak or i shall be too late. “i have said, gentlemen, that i am this man’s wife. he was fifty and i a foolish girl of twenty when we married. it was in a city of russia, a university—i will not name the place.” “god bless you, anna!” murmured the old man again. “we were reformers—revolutionists—nihilists, you understand. he and i and many more. then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward, my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions. yes, we were all arrested upon his confession. some of us found our way to the gallows, and some to siberia. i was among these last, but my term was not for life. my husband came to england with his ill-gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since, knowing well that if the brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done.” the old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette. “i am in your hands, anna,” said he. “you were always good to me.” “i have not yet told you the height of his villainy,” said she. “among our comrades of the order, there was one who was the friend of my heart. he was noble, unselfish, loving—all that my husband was not. he hated violence. we were all guilty—if that is guilt—but he was not. he wrote forever dissuading us from such a course. these letters would have saved him. so would my diary, in which, from day to day, i had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken. my husband found and kept both diary and letters. he hid them, and he tried hard to swear away the young man’s life. in this he failed, but alexis was sent a convict to siberia, where now, at this moment, he works in a salt mine. think of that, you villain, you villain!—now, now, at this very moment, alexis, a man whose name you are not worthy to speak, works and lives like a slave, and yet i have your life in my hands, and i let you go.” “you were always a noble woman, anna,” said the old man, puffing at his cigarette. she had risen, but she fell back again with a little cry of pain. “i must finish,” she said. “when my term was over i set myself to get the diary and letters which, if sent to the russian government, would procure my friend’s release. i knew that my husband had come to england. after months of searching i discovered where he was. i knew that he still had the diary, for when i was in siberia i had a letter from him once, reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages. yet i was sure that, with his revengeful nature, he would never give it to me of his own free-will. i must get it for myself. with this object i engaged an agent from a private detective firm, who entered my husband’s house as a secretary—it was your second secretary, sergius, the one who left you so hurriedly. he found that papers were kept in the cupboard, and he got an impression of the key. he would not go farther. he furnished me with a plan of the house, and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty, as the secretary was employed up here. so at last i took my courage in both hands, and i came down to get the papers for myself. i succeeded; but at what a cost! “i had just taken the paper; and was locking the cupboard, when the young man seized me. i had seen him already that morning. he had met me on the road, and i had asked him to tell me where professor coram lived, not knowing that he was in his employ.” “exactly! exactly!” said holmes. “the secretary came back, and told his employer of the woman he had met. then, in his last breath, he tried to send a message that it was she—the she whom he had just discussed with him.” “you must let me speak,” said the woman, in an imperative voice, and her face contracted as if in pain. “when he had fallen i rushed from the room, chose the wrong door, and found myself in my husband’s room. he spoke of giving me up. i showed him that if he did so, his life was in my hands. if he gave me to the law, i could give him to the brotherhood. it was not that i wished to live for my own sake, but it was that i desired to accomplish my purpose. he knew that i would do what i said—that his own fate was involved in mine. for that reason, and for no other, he shielded me. he thrust me into that dark hiding-place—a relic of old days, known only to himself. he took his meals in his own room, and so was able to give me part of his food. it was agreed that when the police left the house i should slip away by night and come back no more. but in some way you have read our plans.” she tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet. “these are my last words,” said she; “here is the packet which will save alexis. i confide it to your honour and to your love of justice. take it! you will deliver it at the russian embassy. now, i have done my duty, and——” “stop her!” cried holmes. he had bounded across the room and had wrenched a small phial from her hand. “too late!” she said, sinking back on the bed. “too late! i took the poison before i left my hiding-place. my head swims! i am going! i charge you, sir, to remember the packet.” “a simple case, and yet, in some ways, an instructive one,” holmes remarked, as we travelled back to town. “it hinged from the outset upon the pince-nez. but for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these, i am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution. it was clear to me, from the strength of the glasses, that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them. when you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step, i remarked, as you may remember, that it was a noteworthy performance. in my mind i set it down as an impossible performance, save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses. i was forced, therefore, to consider seriously the hypothesis that she had remained within the house. on perceiving the similarity of the two corridors, it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake, and, in that case, it was evident that she must have entered the professor’s room. i was keenly on the alert, therefore, for whatever would bear out this supposition, and i examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding-place. the carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed, so i dismissed the idea of a trap-door. there might well be a recess behind the books. as you are aware, such devices are common in old libraries. i observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points, but that one bookcase was left clear. this, then, might be the door. i could see no marks to guide me, but the carpet was of a dun colour, which lends itself very well to examination. i therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes, and i dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase. it was a simple trick, but exceedingly effective. i then went downstairs, and i ascertained, in your presence, watson, without your perceiving the drift of my remarks, that professor coram’s consumption of food had increased—as one would expect when he is supplying a second person. we then ascended to the room again, when, by upsetting the cigarette-box, i obtained a very excellent view of the floor, and was able to see quite clearly, from the traces upon the cigarette ash, that the prisoner had in our absence come out from her retreat. well, hopkins, here we are at charing cross, and i congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion. you are going to headquarters, no doubt. i think, watson, you and i will drive together to the russian embassy.” the adventure of the missing three-quarter we were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at baker street, but i have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy february morning, some seven or eight years ago, and gave mr. sherlock holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. it was addressed to him, and ran thus: please await me. terrible misfortune. right wing three-quarter missing, indispensable to-morrow. overton. “strand postmark, and dispatched ten thirty-six,” said holmes, reading it over and over. “mr. overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence. well, well, he will be here, i daresay, by the time i have looked through _the times_, and then we shall know all about it. even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days.” things had indeed been very slow with us, and i had learned to dread such periods of inaction, for i knew by experience that my companion’s brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work. for years i had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career. now i knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer craved for this artificial stimulus, but i was well aware that the fiend was not dead but sleeping, and i have known that the sleep was a light one and the waking near when in periods of idleness i have seen the drawn look upon holmes’s ascetic face, and the brooding of his deep-set and inscrutable eyes. therefore i blessed this mr. overton whoever he might be, since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his tempestuous life. as we had expected, the telegram was soon followed by its sender, and the card of mr. cyril overton, trinity college, cambridge, announced the arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone of solid bone and muscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad shoulders, and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with anxiety. “mr. sherlock holmes?” my companion bowed. “i’ve been down to scotland yard, mr. holmes. i saw inspector stanley hopkins. he advised me to come to you. he said the case, so far as he could see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police.” “pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.” “it’s awful, mr. holmes—simply awful! i wonder my hair isn’t grey. godfrey staunton—you’ve heard of him, of course? he’s simply the hinge that the whole team turns on. i’d rather spare two from the pack, and have godfrey for my three-quarter line. whether it’s passing, or tackling, or dribbling, there’s no one to touch him, and then, he’s got the head, and can hold us all together. what am i to do? that’s what i ask you, mr. holmes. there’s moorhouse, first reserve, but he is trained as a half, and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touchline. he’s a fine place-kick, it’s true, but then he has no judgment, and he can’t sprint for nuts. why, morton or johnson, the oxford fliers, could romp round him. stevenson is fast enough, but he couldn’t drop from the twenty-five line, and a three-quarter who can’t either punt or drop isn’t worth a place for pace alone. no, mr. holmes, we are done unless you can help me to find godfrey staunton.” my friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech, which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon the speaker’s knee. when our visitor was silent holmes stretched out his hand and took down letter “s” of his commonplace book. for once he dug in vain into that mine of varied information. “there is arthur h. staunton, the rising young forger,” said he, “and there was henry staunton, whom i helped to hang, but godfrey staunton is a new name to me.” it was our visitor’s turn to look surprised. “why, mr. holmes, i thought you knew things,” said he. “i suppose, then, if you have never heard of godfrey staunton, you don’t know cyril overton either?” holmes shook his head good humouredly. “great scott!” cried the athlete. “why, i was first reserve for england against wales, and i’ve skippered the ’varsity all this year. but that’s nothing! i didn’t think there was a soul in england who didn’t know godfrey staunton, the crack three-quarter, cambridge, blackheath, and five internationals. good lord! mr. holmes, where _have_ you lived?” holmes laughed at the young giant’s naïve astonishment. “you live in a different world to me, mr. overton—a sweeter and healthier one. my ramifications stretch out into many sections of society, but never, i am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the best and soundest thing in england. however, your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play, there may be work for me to do. so now, my good sir, i beg you to sit down and to tell me, slowly and quietly, exactly what it is that has occurred, and how you desire that i should help you.” young overton’s face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more accustomed to using his muscles than his wits, but by degrees, with many repetitions and obscurities which i may omit from his narrative, he laid his strange story before us. “it’s this way, mr. holmes. as i have said, i am the skipper of the rugger team of cambridge ’varsity, and godfrey staunton is my best man. to-morrow we play oxford. yesterday we all came up, and we settled at bentley’s private hotel. at ten o’clock i went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost, for i believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. i had a word or two with godfrey before he turned in. he seemed to me to be pale and bothered. i asked him what was the matter. he said he was all right—just a touch of headache. i bade him good-night and left him. half an hour later, the porter tells me that a rough-looking man with a beard called with a note for godfrey. he had not gone to bed, and the note was taken to his room. godfrey read it, and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-axed. the porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me, but godfrey stopped him, had a drink of water, and pulled himself together. then he went downstairs, said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall, and the two of them went off together. the last that the porter saw of them, they were almost running down the street in the direction of the strand. this morning godfrey’s room was empty, his bed had never been slept in, and his things were all just as i had seen them the night before. he had gone off at a moment’s notice with this stranger, and no word has come from him since. i don’t believe he will ever come back. he was a sportsman, was godfrey, down to his marrow, and he wouldn’t have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him. no: i feel as if he were gone for good, and we should never see him again.” sherlock holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular narrative. “what did you do?” he asked. “i wired to cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there. i have had an answer. no one has seen him.” “could he have got back to cambridge?” “yes, there is a late train—quarter-past eleven.” “but, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?” “no, he has not been seen.” “what did you do next?” “i wired to lord mount-james.” “why to lord mount-james?” “godfrey is an orphan, and lord mount-james is his nearest relative—his uncle, i believe.” “indeed. this throws new light upon the matter. lord mount-james is one of the richest men in england.” “so i’ve heard godfrey say.” “and your friend was closely related?” “yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly eighty—cram full of gout, too. they say he could chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles. he never allowed godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an absolute miser, but it will all come to him right enough.” “have you heard from lord mount-james?” “no.” “what motive could your friend have in going to lord mount-james?” “well, something was worrying him the night before, and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative, who had so much of it, though from all i have heard he would not have much chance of getting it. godfrey was not fond of the old man. he would not go if he could help it.” “well, we can soon determine that. if your friend was going to his relative, lord mount-james, you have then to explain the visit of this rough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the agitation that was caused by his coming.” cyril overton pressed his hands to his head. “i can make nothing of it,” said he. “well, well, i have a clear day, and i shall be happy to look into the matter,” said holmes. “i should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman. it must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is likely to hold him away. let us step round together to the hotel, and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter.” sherlock holmes was a past-master in the art of putting a humble witness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of godfrey staunton’s abandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter had to tell. the visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither was he a workingman. he was simply what the porter described as a “medium-looking chap,” a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed. he seemed himself to be agitated. the porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note. godfrey staunton had crammed the note into his pocket. staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall. they had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had only distinguished the one word “time.” then they had hurried off in the manner described. it was just half-past ten by the hall clock. “let me see,” said holmes, seating himself on staunton’s bed. “you are the day porter, are you not?” “yes, sir, i go off duty at eleven.” “the night porter saw nothing, i suppose?” “no, sir, one theatre party came in late. no one else.” “were you on duty all day yesterday?” “yes, sir.” “did you take any messages to mr. staunton?” “yes, sir, one telegram.” “ah! that’s interesting. what o’clock was this?” “about six.” “where was mr. staunton when he received it?” “here in his room.” “were you present when he opened it?” “yes, sir, i waited to see if there was an answer.” “well, was there?” “yes, sir, he wrote an answer.” “did you take it?” “no, he took it himself.” “but he wrote it in your presence.” “yes, sir. i was standing by the door, and he with his back turned at that table. when he had written it, he said: ‘all right, porter, i will take this myself.’” “what did he write it with?” “a pen, sir.” “was the telegraphic form one of these on the table?” “yes, sir, it was the top one.” holmes rose. taking the forms, he carried them over to the window and carefully examined that which was uppermost. “it is a pity he did not write in pencil,” said he, throwing them down again with a shrug of disappointment. “as you have no doubt frequently observed, watson, the impression usually goes through—a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage. however, i can find no trace here. i rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a broad-pointed quill pen, and i can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this blotting-pad. ah, yes, surely this is the very thing!” he tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and turned towards us the following hieroglyphic: hieroglyphic cyril overton was much excited. “hold it to the glass!” he cried. “that is unnecessary,” said holmes. “the paper is thin, and the reverse will give the message. here it is.” he turned it over, and we read: the reverse “so that is the tail end of the telegram which godfrey staunton dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance. there are at least six words of the message which have escaped us; but what remains—‘stand by us for god’s sake!’—proves that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him, and from which someone else could protect him. ‘_us_,’ mark you! another person was involved. who should it be but the pale-faced, bearded man, who seemed himself in so nervous a state? what, then, is the connection between godfrey staunton and the bearded man? and what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger? our inquiry has already narrowed down to that.” “we have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed,” i suggested. “exactly, my dear watson. your reflection, though profound, had already crossed my mind. but i daresay it may have come to your notice that, counterfoil of another man’s message, there may be some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you. there is so much red tape in these matters. however, i have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained. meanwhile, i should like in your presence, mr. overton, to go through these papers which have been left upon the table.” there were a number of letters, bills, and notebooks, which holmes turned over and examined with quick, nervous fingers and darting, penetrating eyes. “nothing here,” he said, at last. “by the way, i suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow—nothing amiss with him?” “sound as a bell.” “have you ever known him ill?” “not a day. he has been laid up with a hack, and once he slipped his knee-cap, but that was nothing.” “perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose. i should think he may have had some secret trouble. with your assent, i will put one or two of these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear upon our future inquiry.” “one moment—one moment!” cried a querulous voice, and we looked up to find a queer little old man, jerking and twitching in the doorway. he was dressed in rusty black, with a very broad-brimmed top-hat and a loose white necktie—the whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or of an undertaker’s mute. yet, in spite of his shabby and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention. “who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman’s papers?” he asked. “i am a private detective, and i am endeavouring to explain his disappearance.” “oh, you are, are you? and who instructed you, eh?” “this gentleman, mr. staunton’s friend, was referred to me by scotland yard.” “who are you, sir?” “i am cyril overton.” “then it is you who sent me a telegram. my name is lord mount-james. i came round as quickly as the bayswater bus would bring me. so you have instructed a detective?” “yes, sir.” “and are you prepared to meet the cost?” “i have no doubt, sir, that my friend godfrey, when we find him, will be prepared to do that.” “but if he is never found, eh? answer me that!” “in that case, no doubt his family——” “nothing of the sort, sir!” screamed the little man. “don’t look to me for a penny—not a penny! you understand that, mr. detective! i am all the family that this young man has got, and i tell you that i am not responsible. if he has any expectations it is due to the fact that i have never wasted money, and i do not propose to begin to do so now. as to those papers with which you are making so free, i may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them, you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them.” “very good, sir,” said sherlock holmes. “may i ask, in the meanwhile, whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man’s disappearance?” “no, sir, i have not. he is big enough and old enough to look after himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself, i entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him.” “i quite understand your position,” said holmes, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “perhaps you don’t quite understand mine. godfrey staunton appears to have been a poor man. if he has been kidnapped, it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses. the fame of your wealth has gone abroad, lord mount-james, and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house, your habits, and your treasure.” the face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his neckcloth. “heavens, sir, what an idea! i never thought of such villainy! what inhuman rogues there are in the world! but godfrey is a fine lad—a staunch lad. nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away. i’ll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening. in the meantime spare no pains, mr. detective! i beg you to leave no stone unturned to bring him safely back. as to money, well, so far as a fiver or even a tenner goes you can always look to me.” even in his chastened frame of mind, the noble miser could give us no information which could help us, for he knew little of the private life of his nephew. our only clue lay in the truncated telegram, and with a copy of this in his hand holmes set forth to find a second link for his chain. we had shaken off lord mount-james, and overton had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had befallen them. there was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. we halted outside it. “it’s worth trying, watson,” said holmes. “of course, with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage yet. i don’t suppose they remember faces in so busy a place. let us venture it.” “i am sorry to trouble you,” said he, in his blandest manner, to the young woman behind the grating; “there is some small mistake about a telegram i sent yesterday. i have had no answer, and i very much fear that i must have omitted to put my name at the end. could you tell me if this was so?” the young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils. “what o’clock was it?” she asked. “a little after six.” “whom was it to?” holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me. “the last words in it were ‘for god’s sake,’” he whispered, confidentially; “i am very anxious at getting no answer.” the young woman separated one of the forms. “this is it. there is no name,” said she, smoothing it out upon the counter. “then that, of course, accounts for my getting no answer,” said holmes. “dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure! good-morning, miss, and many thanks for having relieved my mind.” he chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more. “well?” i asked. “we progress, my dear watson, we progress. i had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram, but i could hardly hope to succeed the very first time.” “and what have you gained?” “a starting-point for our investigation.” he hailed a cab. “king’s cross station,” said he. “we have a journey, then?” “yes, i think we must run down to cambridge together. all the indications seem to me to point in that direction.” “tell me,” i asked, as we rattled up gray’s inn road, “have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance? i don’t think that among all our cases i have known one where the motives are more obscure. surely you don’t really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle?” “i confess, my dear watson, that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation. it struck me, however, as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person.” “it certainly did that; but what are your alternatives?” “i could mention several. you must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important match, and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side. it may, of course, be a coincidence, but it is interesting. amateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public, and it is possible that it might be worth someone’s while to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a race-horse. there is one explanation. a second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property, however modest his means may at present be, and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted.” “these theories take no account of the telegram.” “quite true, watson. the telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal, and we must not permit our attention to wander away from it. it is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to cambridge. the path of our investigation is at present obscure, but i shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up, or made a considerable advance along it.” it was already dark when we reached the old university city. holmes took a cab at the station and ordered the man to drive to the house of dr. leslie armstrong. a few minutes later, we had stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare. we were shown in, and after a long wait were at last admitted into the consulting-room, where we found the doctor seated behind his table. it argues the degree in which i had lost touch with my profession that the name of leslie armstrong was unknown to me. now i am aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school of the university, but a thinker of european reputation in more than one branch of science. yet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance at the man, the square, massive face, the brooding eyes under the thatched brows, and the granite moulding of the inflexible jaw. a man of deep character, a man with an alert mind, grim, ascetic, self-contained, formidable—so i read dr. leslie armstrong. he held my friend’s card in his hand, and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features. “i have heard your name, mr. sherlock holmes, and i am aware of your profession—one of which i by no means approve.” “in that, doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country,” said my friend, quietly. “so far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime, sir, they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community, though i cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose. where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals, when you rake up family matters which are better hidden, and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself. at the present moment, for example, i should be writing a treatise instead of conversing with you.” “no doubt, doctor; and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise. incidentally, i may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame, and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police. you may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer, who goes in front of the regular forces of the country. i have come to ask you about mr. godfrey staunton.” “what about him?” “you know him, do you not?” “he is an intimate friend of mine.” “you are aware that he has disappeared?” “ah, indeed!” there was no change of expression in the rugged features of the doctor. “he left his hotel last night—he has not been heard of.” “no doubt he will return.” “to-morrow is the ’varsity football match.” “i have no sympathy with these childish games. the young man’s fate interests me deeply, since i know him and like him. the football match does not come within my horizon at all.” “i claim your sympathy, then, in my investigation of mr. staunton’s fate. do you know where he is?” “certainly not.” “you have not seen him since yesterday?” “no, i have not.” “was mr. staunton a healthy man?” “absolutely.” “did you ever know him ill?” “never.” holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor’s eyes. “then perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas, paid by mr. godfrey staunton last month to dr. leslie armstrong, of cambridge. i picked it out from among the papers upon his desk.” the doctor flushed with anger. “i do not feel that there is any reason why i should render an explanation to you, mr. holmes.” holmes replaced the bill in his notebook. “if you prefer a public explanation, it must come sooner or later,” said he. “i have already told you that i can hush up that which others will be bound to publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence.” “i know nothing about it.” “did you hear from mr. staunton in london?” “certainly not.” “dear me, dear me—the postoffice again!” holmes sighed, wearily. “a most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from london by godfrey staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening—a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance—and yet you have not had it. it is most culpable. i shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint.” dr. leslie armstrong sprang up from behind his desk, and his dark face was crimson with fury. “i’ll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir,” said he. “you can tell your employer, lord mount-james, that i do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents. no, sir—not another word!” he rang the bell furiously. “john, show these gentlemen out!” a pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the street. holmes burst out laughing. “dr. leslie armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,” said he. “i have not seen a man who, if he turns his talents that way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious moriarty. and now, my poor watson, here we are, stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town, which we cannot leave without abandoning our case. this little inn just opposite armstrong’s house is singularly adapted to our needs. if you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night, i may have time to make a few inquiries.” these few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy proceeding than holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly nine o’clock. he was pale and dejected, stained with dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. a cold supper was ready upon the table, and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was ready to take that half comic and wholly philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were going awry. the sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window. a brougham and pair of greys, under the glare of a gas-lamp, stood before the doctor’s door. “it’s been out three hours,” said holmes; “started at half-past six, and here it is back again. that gives a radius of ten or twelve miles, and he does it once, or sometimes twice, a day.” “no unusual thing for a doctor in practice.” “but armstrong is not really a doctor in practice. he is a lecturer and a consultant, but he does not care for general practice, which distracts him from his literary work. why, then, does he make these long journeys, which must be exceedingly irksome to him, and who is it that he visits?” “his coachman——” “my dear watson, can you doubt that it was to him that i first applied? i do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the promptings of his master, but he was rude enough to set a dog at me. neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick, however, and the matter fell through. relations were strained after that, and further inquiries out of the question. all that i have learned i got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn. it was he who told me of the doctor’s habits and of his daily journey. at that instant, to give point to his words, the carriage came round to the door.” “could you not follow it?” “excellent, watson! you are scintillating this evening. the idea did cross my mind. there is, as you may have observed, a bicycle shop next to our inn. into this i rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight. i rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, i followed its lights until we were clear of the town. we had got well out on the country road, when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. the carriage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly back to where i had also halted, and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not impede the passage of my bicycle. nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it. i at once rode past the carriage, and, keeping to the main road, i went on for a few miles, and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed. there was no sign of it, however, and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads which i had observed. i rode back, but again saw nothing of the carriage, and now, as you perceive, it has returned after me. of course, i had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of godfrey staunton, and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns dr. armstrong is at present of interest to us, but, now that i find he keeps so keen a look-out upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions, the affair appears more important, and i shall not be satisfied until i have made the matter clear.” “we can follow him to-morrow.” “can we? it is not so easy as you seem to think. you are not familiar with cambridgeshire scenery, are you? it does not lend itself to concealment. all this country that i passed over to-night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed to-night. i have wired to overton to let us know any fresh london developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon dr. armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of staunton’s urgent message. he knows where the young man is—to that i’ll swear, and if he knows, then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. at present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition.” and yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the mystery. a note was handed in after breakfast, which holmes passed across to me with a smile. sir [it ran],—i can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my movements. i have, as you discovered last night, a window at the back of my brougham, and if you desire a twenty-mile ride which will lead you to the spot from which you started, you have only to follow me. meanwhile, i can inform you that no spying upon me can in any way help mr. godfrey staunton, and i am convinced that the best service you can do to that gentleman is to return at once to london and to report to your employer that you are unable to trace him. your time in cambridge will certainly be wasted. yours faithfully, leslie armstrong. “an outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor,” said holmes. “well, well, he excites my curiosity, and i must really know before i leave him.” “his carriage is at his door now,” said i. “there he is stepping into it. i saw him glance up at our window as he did so. suppose i try my luck upon the bicycle?” “no, no, my dear watson! with all respect for your natural acumen, i do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor. i think that possibly i can attain our end by some independent explorations of my own. i am afraid that i must leave you to your own devices, as the appearance of _two_ inquiring strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than i care for. no doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in this venerable city, and i hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening.” once more, however, my friend was destined to be disappointed. he came back at night weary and unsuccessful. “i have had a blank day, watson. having got the doctor’s general direction, i spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans and other local news agencies. i have covered some ground. chesterton, histon, waterbeach, and oakington have each been explored, and have each proved disappointing. the daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such sleepy hollows. the doctor has scored once more. is there a telegram for me?” “yes, i opened it. here it is: “ask for pompey from jeremy dixon, trinity college.” “i don’t understand it.” “oh, it is clear enough. it is from our friend overton, and is in answer to a question from me. i’ll just send round a note to mr. jeremy dixon, and then i have no doubt that our luck will turn. by the way, is there any news of the match?” “yes, the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last edition. oxford won by a goal and two tries. the last sentences of the description say: “‘the defeat of the light blues may be entirely attributed to the unfortunate absence of the crack international, godfrey staunton, whose want was felt at every instant of the game. the lack of combination in the three-quarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-working pack.’” “then our friend overton’s forebodings have been justified,” said holmes. “personally i am in agreement with dr. armstrong, and football does not come within my horizon. early to bed to-night, watson, for i foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day.” i was horrified by my first glimpse of holmes next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. i associated that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and i feared the worst when i saw it glittering in his hand. he laughed at my expression of dismay and laid it upon the table. “no, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. it is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery. on this syringe i base all my hopes. i have just returned from a small scouting expedition, and everything is favourable. eat a good breakfast, watson, for i propose to get upon dr. armstrong’s trail to-day, and once on it i will not stop for rest or food until i run him to his burrow.” “in that case,” said i, “we had best carry our breakfast with us, for he is making an early start. his carriage is at the door.” “never mind. let him go. he will be clever if he can drive where i cannot follow him. when you have finished, come downstairs with me, and i will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in the work that lies before us.” when we descended i followed holmes into the stable yard, where he opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared, white-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound. “let me introduce you to pompey,” said he. “pompey is the pride of the local draghounds—no very great flier, as his build will show, but a staunch hound on a scent. well, pompey, you may not be fast, but i expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle-aged london gentlemen, so i will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to your collar. now, boy, come along, and show what you can do.” he led him across to the doctor’s door. the dog sniffed round for an instant, and then with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street, tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. in half an hour, we were clear of the town and hastening down a country road. “what have you done, holmes?” i asked. “a threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. i walked into the doctor’s yard this morning, and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel. a draghound will follow aniseed from here to john o’groat’s, and our friend, armstrong, would have to drive through the cam before he would shake pompey off his trail. oh, the cunning rascal! this is how he gave me the slip the other night.” the dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a grass-grown lane. half a mile farther this opened into another broad road, and the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town, which we had just quitted. the road took a sweep to the south of the town, and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we started. “this _détour_ has been entirely for our benefit, then?” said holmes. “no wonder that my inquiries among those villagers led to nothing. the doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth, and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception. this should be the village of trumpington to the right of us. and, by jove! here is the brougham coming round the corner. quick, watson—quick, or we are done!” he sprang through a gate into a field, dragging the reluctant pompey after him. we had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage rattled past. i caught a glimpse of dr. armstrong within, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his hands, the very image of distress. i could tell by my companion’s graver face that he also had seen. “i fear there is some dark ending to our quest,” said he. “it cannot be long before we know it. come, pompey! ah, it is the cottage in the field!” there could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey. pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate, where the marks of the brougham’s wheels were still to be seen. a footpath led across to the lonely cottage. holmes tied the dog to the hedge, and we hastened onward. my friend knocked at the little rustic door, and knocked again without response. and yet the cottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to our ears—a kind of drone of misery and despair which was indescribably melancholy. holmes paused irresolute, and then he glanced back at the road which he had just traversed. a brougham was coming down it, and there could be no mistaking those grey horses. “by jove, the doctor is coming back!” cried holmes. “that settles it. we are bound to see what it means before he comes.” he opened the door, and we stepped into the hall. the droning sound swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long, deep wail of distress. it came from upstairs. holmes darted up, and i followed him. he pushed open a half-closed door, and we both stood appalled at the sight before us. a woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. her calm pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a great tangle of golden hair. at the foot of the bed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose frame was racked by his sobs. so absorbed was he by his bitter grief, that he never looked up until holmes’s hand was on his shoulder. “are you mr. godfrey staunton?” “yes, yes, i am—but you are too late. she is dead.” the man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance. holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance when there was a step upon the stairs, and there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of dr. armstrong at the door. “so, gentlemen,” said he, “you have attained your end and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. i would not brawl in the presence of death, but i can assure you that if i were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity.” “excuse me, dr. armstrong, i think we are a little at cross-purposes,” said my friend, with dignity. “if you could step downstairs with us, we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair.” a minute later, the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sitting-room below. “well, sir?” said he. “i wish you to understand, in the first place, that i am not employed by lord mount-james, and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman. when a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate, but having done so the matter ends so far as i am concerned, and so long as there is nothing criminal i am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity. if, as i imagine, there is no breach of the law in this matter, you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my cooperation in keeping the facts out of the papers.” dr. armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung holmes by the hand. “you are a good fellow,” said he. “i had misjudged you. i thank heaven that my compunction at leaving poor staunton all alone in this plight caused me to turn my carriage back and so to make your acquaintance. knowing as much as you do, the situation is very easily explained. a year ago godfrey staunton lodged in london for a time and became passionately attached to his landlady’s daughter, whom he married. she was as good as she was beautiful and as intelligent as she was good. no man need be ashamed of such a wife. but godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old nobleman, and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his inheritance. i knew the lad well, and i loved him for his many excellent qualities. i did all i could to help him to keep things straight. we did our very best to keep the thing from everyone, for, when once such a whisper gets about, it is not long before everyone has heard it. thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion, godfrey has up to now succeeded. their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant, who has at present gone for assistance to trumpington. but at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife. it was consumption of the most virulent kind. the poor boy was half crazed with grief, and yet he had to go to london to play this match, for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret. i tried to cheer him up by wire, and he sent me one in reply, imploring me to do all i could. this was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen. i did not tell him how urgent the danger was, for i knew that he could do no good here, but i sent the truth to the girl’s father, and he very injudiciously communicated it to godfrey. the result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy, and has remained in the same state, kneeling at the end of her bed, until this morning death put an end to her sufferings. that is all, mr. holmes, and i am sure that i can rely upon your discretion and that of your friend.” holmes grasped the doctor’s hand. “come, watson,” said he, and we passed from that house of grief into the pale sunlight of the winter day. the adventure of the abbey grange it was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning, towards the end of the winter of ’97, that i was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. it was holmes. the candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face, and told me at a glance that something was amiss. “come, watson, come!” he cried. “the game is afoot. not a word! into your clothes and come!” ten minutes later we were both in a cab, and rattling through the silent streets on our way to charing cross station. the first faint winter’s dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent london reek. holmes nestled in silence into his heavy coat, and i was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast. it was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and taken our places in the kentish train that we were sufficiently thawed, he to speak and i to listen. holmes drew a note from his pocket, and read aloud: abbey grange, marsham, kent, 3:30 a.m. my dear mr. holmes: i should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. it is something quite in your line. except for releasing the lady i will see that everything is kept exactly as i have found it, but i beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult to leave sir eustace there. yours faithfully, stanley hopkins. “hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified,” said holmes. “i fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and i must admit, watson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much which i deplore in your narratives. your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. you slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy, in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader.” “why do you not write them yourself?” i said, with some bitterness. “i will, my dear watson, i will. at present i am, as you know, fairly busy, but i propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook, which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume. our present research appears to be a case of murder.” “you think this sir eustace is dead, then?” “i should say so. hopkins’s writing shows considerable agitation, and he is not an emotional man. yes, i gather there has been violence, and that the body is left for our inspection. a mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me. as to the release of the lady, it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. we are moving in high life, watson, crackling paper, ‘e.b.’ monogram, coat-of-arms, picturesque address. i think that friend hopkins will live up to his reputation, and that we shall have an interesting morning. the crime was committed before twelve last night.” “how can you possibly tell?” “by an inspection of the trains, and by reckoning the time. the local police had to be called in, they had to communicate with scotland yard, hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me. all that makes a fair night’s work. well, here we are at chiselhurst station, and we shall soon set our doubts at rest.” a drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us to a park gate, which was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster. the avenue ran through a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low, widespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of palladio. the central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new. the youthful figure and alert, eager face of inspector stanley hopkins confronted us in the open doorway. “i’m very glad you have come, mr. holmes. and you, too, dr. watson. but, indeed, if i had my time over again, i should not have troubled you, for since the lady has come to herself, she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. you remember that lewisham gang of burglars?” “what, the three randalls?” “exactly; the father and two sons. it’s their work. i have not a doubt of it. they did a job at sydenham a fortnight ago and were seen and described. rather cool to do another so soon and so near, but it is they, beyond all doubt. it’s a hanging matter this time.” “sir eustace is dead, then?” “yes, his head was knocked in with his own poker.” “sir eustace brackenstall, the driver tells me.” “exactly—one of the richest men in kent—lady brackenstall is in the morning-room. poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. she seemed half dead when i saw her first. i think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts. then we will examine the dining-room together.” lady brackenstall was no ordinary person. seldom have i seen so graceful a figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful a face. she was a blonde, golden-haired, blue-eyed, and would no doubt have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring, had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard. her sufferings were physical as well as mental, for over one eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling, which her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing assiduously with vinegar and water. the lady lay back exhausted upon a couch, but her quick, observant gaze, as we entered the room, and the alert expression of her beautiful features, showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience. she was enveloped in a loose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black sequin-covered dinner-dress lay upon the couch beside her. “i have told you all that happened, mr. hopkins,” she said, wearily. “could you not repeat it for me? well, if you think it necessary, i will tell these gentlemen what occurred. have they been in the dining-room yet?” “i thought they had better hear your ladyship’s story first.” “i shall be glad when you can arrange matters. it is horrible to me to think of him still lying there.” she shuddered and buried her face in her hands. as she did so, the loose gown fell back from her forearms. holmes uttered an exclamation. “you have other injuries, madam! what is this?” two vivid red spots stood out on one of the white, round limbs. she hastily covered it. “it is nothing. it has no connection with this hideous business to-night. if you and your friend will sit down, i will tell you all i can. “i am the wife of sir eustace brackenstall. i have been married about a year. i suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one. i fear that all our neighbours would tell you that, even if i were to attempt to deny it. perhaps the fault may be partly mine. i was brought up in the freer, less conventional atmosphere of south australia, and this english life, with its proprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. but the main reason lies in the one fact, which is notorious to everyone, and that is that sir eustace was a confirmed drunkard. to be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant. can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night? it is a sacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. i say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land—god will not let such wickedness endure.” for an instant she sat up, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow. then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing. at last she continued: “i will tell you about last night. you are aware, perhaps, that in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing. this central block is made up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above. my maid, theresa, sleeps above my room. there is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. this must have been well-known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did. “sir eustace retired about half-past ten. the servants had already gone to their quarters. only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until i needed her services. i sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. then i walked round to see that all was right before i went upstairs. it was my custom to do this myself, for, as i have explained, sir eustace was not always to be trusted. i went into the kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. as i approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, i suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. i flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. the window is a long french one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. i held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man i saw two others, who were in the act of entering. i stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. he caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. i opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. i must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when i came to myself, i found that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. i was so firmly bound that i could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound. it was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. he had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. he was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. he rushed at the burglars, but another—it was an elderly man—stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed. he fell with a groan and never moved again. i fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few minutes during which i was insensible. when i opened my eyes i found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. each of them had a glass in his hand. i have already told you, have i not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. they might have been a father with his two sons. they talked together in whispers. then they came over and made sure that i was securely bound. finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. it was quite a quarter of an hour before i got my mouth free. when i did so, my screams brought the maid to my assistance. the other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with london. that is really all that i can tell you, gentlemen, and i trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.” “any questions, mr. holmes?” asked hopkins. “i will not impose any further tax upon lady brackenstall’s patience and time,” said holmes. “before i go into the dining-room, i should like to hear your experience.” he looked at the maid. “i saw the men before ever they came into the house,” said she. “as i sat by my bedroom window i saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder, but i thought nothing of it at the time. it was more than an hour after that i heard my mistress scream, and down i ran, to find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his blood and brains over the room. it was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him, but she never wanted courage, did miss mary fraser of adelaide and lady brackenstall of abbey grange hasn’t learned new ways. you’ve questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.” with a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room. “she has been with her all her life,” said hopkins. “nursed her as a baby, and came with her to england when they first left australia, eighteen months ago. theresa wright is her name, and the kind of maid you don’t pick up nowadays. this way, mr. holmes, if you please!” the keen interest had passed out of holmes’s expressive face, and i knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. there still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them? an abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles would experience something of the annoyance which i read in my friend’s eyes. yet the scene in the dining-room of the abbey grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest. it was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a fine array of deer’s heads and ancient weapons around the walls. at the further end from the door was the high french window of which we had heard. three smaller windows on the right-hand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. on the left was a large, deep fireplace, with a massive, overhanging oak mantelpiece. beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and cross-bars at the bottom. in and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. in releasing the lady, the cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it had been secured still remained. these details only struck our attention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the tigerskin hearthrug in front of the fire. it was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age. he lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning through his short, black beard. his two clenched hands were raised above his head, and a heavy, blackthorn stick lay across them. his dark, handsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression. he had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he wore a foppish, embroidered nightshirt, and his bare feet projected from his trousers. his head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion. holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought. “he must be a powerful man, this elder randall,” he remarked. “yes,” said hopkins. “i have some record of the fellow, and he is a rough customer.” “you should have no difficulty in getting him.” “not the slightest. we have been on the look-out for him, and there was some idea that he had got away to america. now that we know that the gang are here, i don’t see how they can escape. we have the news at every seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. what beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the lady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognize the description.” “exactly. one would have expected that they would silence lady brackenstall as well.” “they may not have realized,” i suggested, “that she had recovered from her faint.” “that is likely enough. if she seemed to be senseless, they would not take her life. what about this poor fellow, hopkins? i seem to have heard some queer stories about him.” “he was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really went the whole way. the devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he was capable of anything. from what i hear, in spite of all his wealth and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. there was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire—her ladyship’s dog, to make the matter worse—and that was only hushed up with difficulty. then he threw a decanter at that maid, theresa wright—there was trouble about that. on the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. what are you looking at now?” holmes was down on his knees, examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down. “when this was pulled down, the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly,” he remarked. “no one could hear it. the kitchen stands right at the back of the house.” “how did the burglar know no one would hear it? how dared he pull at a bell-rope in that reckless fashion?” “exactly, mr. holmes, exactly. you put the very question which i have asked myself again and again. there can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits. he must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen. therefore, he must have been in close league with one of the servants. surely that is evident. but there are eight servants, and all of good character.” “other things being equal,” said holmes, “one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter. and yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. well, well, the point is a minor one, and when you have randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. the lady’s story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every detail which we see before us.” he walked to the french window and threw it open. “there are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one would not expect them. i see that these candles in the mantelpiece have been lighted.” “yes, it was by their light and that of the lady’s bedroom candle, that the burglars saw their way about.” “and what did they take?” “well, they did not take much—only half a dozen articles of plate off the sideboard. lady brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of sir eustace that they did not ransack the house, as they would otherwise have done.” “no doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, i understand.” “to steady their nerves.” “exactly. these three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, i suppose?” “yes, and the bottle stands as they left it.” “let us look at it. halloa, halloa! what is this?” the three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine, and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. the bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork. its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed. a change had come over holmes’s manner. he had lost his listless expression, and again i saw an alert light of interest in his keen, deep-set eyes. he raised the cork and examined it minutely. “how did they draw it?” he asked. hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. in it lay some table linen and a large corkscrew. “did lady brackenstall say that screw was used?” “no, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened.” “quite so. as a matter of fact, that screw was _not_ used. this bottle was opened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. if you will examine the top of the cork, you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted. it has never been transfixed. this long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. when you catch this fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession.” “excellent!” said hopkins. “but these glasses do puzzle me, i confess. lady brackenstall actually _saw_ the three men drinking, did she not?” “yes; she was clear about that.” “then there is an end of it. what more is to be said? and yet, you must admit, that the three glasses are very remarkable, hopkins. what? you see nothing remarkable? well, well, let it pass. perhaps, when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. well, good-morning, hopkins. i don’t see that i can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. you will let me know when randall is arrested, and any further developments which may occur. i trust that i shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. come, watson, i fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.” during our return journey, i could see by holmes’s face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed. every now and then, by an effort, he would throw off the impression, and talk as if the matter were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining-room of the abbey grange, in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. at last, by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him. “excuse me, my dear fellow,” said he, as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve, “i am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, watson, i simply _can’t_ leave that case in this condition. every instinct that i possess cries out against it. it’s wrong—it’s all wrong—i’ll swear that it’s wrong. and yet the lady’s story was complete, the maid’s corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. what have i to put up against that? three wine-glasses, that is all. but if i had not taken things for granted, if i had examined everything with the care which i should have shown had we approached the case _de novo_ and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, should i not then have found something more definite to go upon? of course i should. sit down on this bench, watson, until a train for chiselhurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true. the lady’s charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment. “surely there are details in her story which, if we looked at in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. these burglars made a considerable haul at sydenham a fortnight ago. some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part. as a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. again, it is unusual for burglars to operate at so early an hour, it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream, it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man, it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was much more within their reach, and finally, i should say, that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. how do all these unusuals strike you, watson?” “their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. the most unusual thing of all, as it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.” “well, i am not so clear about that, watson, for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape. but at any rate i have shown, have i not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady’s story? and now, on the top of this, comes the incident of the wineglasses.” “what about the wineglasses?” “can you see them in your mind’s eye?” “i see them clearly.” “we are told that three men drank from them. does that strike you as likely?” “why not? there was wine in each glass.” “exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. you must have noticed that fact. what does that suggest to your mind?” “the last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.” “not at all. the bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. there are two possible explanations, and only two. one is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the beeswing. that does not appear probable. no, no, i am sure that i am right.” “what, then, do you suppose?” “that only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people had been here. in that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass, would it not? yes, i am convinced that this is so. but if i have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that lady brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. that is the mission which now lies before us, and here, watson, is the sydenham train.” the household at the abbey grange were much surprised at our return, but sherlock holmes, finding that stanley hopkins had gone off to report to headquarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations which form the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared. seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the demonstration of his professor, i followed every step of that remarkable research. the window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope—each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered. the body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, and all else remained as we had seen it in the morning. finally, to my astonishment, holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece. far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire. for a long time he gazed upward at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall. this brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention. finally, he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction. “it’s all right, watson,” said he. “we have got our case—one of the most remarkable in our collection. but, dear me, how slow-witted i have been, and how nearly i have committed the blunder of my lifetime! now, i think that, with a few missing links, my chain is almost complete.” “you have got your men?” “man, watson, man. only one, but a very formidable person. strong as a lion—witness the blow that bent that poker! six foot three in height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers, finally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. yes, watson, we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual. and yet, in that bell-rope, he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt.” “where was the clue?” “well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope, watson, where would you expect it to break? surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire. why should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?” “because it is frayed there?” “exactly. this end, which we can examine, is frayed. he was cunning enough to do that with his knife. but the other end is not frayed. you could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. you can reconstruct what occurred. the man needed the rope. he would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. what did he do? he sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket—you will see the impression in the dust—and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. i could not reach the place by at least three inches—from which i infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than i. look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! what is it?” “blood.” “undoubtedly it is blood. this alone puts the lady’s story out of court. if she were seated on the chair when the crime was done, how comes that mark? no, no, she was placed in the chair _after_ the death of her husband. i’ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this. we have not yet met our waterloo, watson, but this is our marengo, for it begins in defeat and ends in victory. i should like now to have a few words with the nurse, theresa. we must be wary for a while, if we are to get the information which we want.” she was an interesting person, this stern australian nurse—taciturn, suspicious, ungracious, it took some time before holmes’s pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding amiability. she did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer. “yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. i heard him call my mistress a name, and i told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. then it was that he threw it at me. he might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. he was forever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. she will not even tell me all that he has done to her. she never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but i know very well that they come from a stab with a hatpin. the sly devil—god forgive me that i should speak of him so, now that he is dead! but a devil he was, if ever one walked the earth. he was all honey when first we met him—only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. she had only just arrived in london. yes, it was her first voyage—she had never been from home before. he won her with his title and his money and his false london ways. if she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. what month did we meet him? well, i tell you it was just after we arrived. we arrived in june, and it was july. they were married in january of last year. yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and i have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand.” lady brackenstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter than before. the maid had entered with us, and began once more to foment the bruise upon her mistress’s brow. “i hope,” said the lady, “that you have not come to cross-examine me again?” “no,” holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, “i will not cause you any unnecessary trouble, lady brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make things easy for you, for i am convinced that you are a much-tried woman. if you will treat me as a friend and trust me, you may find that i will justify your trust.” “what do you want me to do?” “to tell me the truth.” “mr. holmes!” “no, no, lady brackenstall—it is no use. you may have heard of any little reputation which i possess. i will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication.” mistress and maid were both staring at holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes. “you are an impudent fellow!” cried theresa. “do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie?” holmes rose from his chair. “have you nothing to tell me?” “i have told you everything.” “think once more, lady brackenstall. would it not be better to be frank?” for an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask. “i have told you all i know.” holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. “i am sorry,” he said, and without another word we left the room and the house. there was a pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. it was frozen over, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan. holmes gazed at it, and then passed on to the lodge gate. there he scribbled a short note for stanley hopkins, and left it with the lodge-keeper. “it may be a hit, or it may be a miss, but we are bound to do something for friend hopkins, just to justify this second visit,” said he. “i will not quite take him into my confidence yet. i think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the adelaide-southampton line, which stands at the end of pall mall, if i remember right. there is a second line of steamers which connect south australia with england, but we will draw the larger cover first.” holmes’s card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention, and he was not long in acquiring all the information he needed. in june of ’95, only one of their line had reached a home port. it was the _rock of gibraltar_, their largest and best boat. a reference to the passenger list showed that miss fraser, of adelaide, with her maid had made the voyage in her. the boat was now somewhere south of the suez canal on her way to australia. her officers were the same as in ’95, with one exception. the first officer, mr. jack crocker, had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship, the _bass rock_, sailing in two days’ time from southampton. he lived at sydenham, but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions, if we cared to wait for him. no, mr. holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know more about his record and character. his record was magnificent. there was not an officer in the fleet to touch him. as to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fellow off the deck of his ship—hot-headed, excitable, but loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. that was the pith of the information with which holmes left the office of the adelaide-southampton company. thence he drove to scotland yard, but, instead of entering, he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. finally he drove round to the charing cross telegraph office, sent off a message, and then, at last, we made for baker street once more. “no, i couldn’t do it, watson,” said he, as we reentered our room. “once that warrant was made out, nothing on earth would save him. once or twice in my career i feel that i have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. i have learned caution now, and i had rather play tricks with the law of england than with my own conscience. let us know a little more before we act.” before evening, we had a visit from inspector stanley hopkins. things were not going very well with him. “i believe that you are a wizard, mr. holmes. i really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?” “i didn’t know it.” “but you told me to examine it.” “you got it, then?” “yes, i got it.” “i am very glad if i have helped you.” “but you haven’t helped me. you have made the affair far more difficult. what sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond?” “it was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. i was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it—who merely took it for a blind, as it were—then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it.” “but why should such an idea cross your mind?” “well, i thought it was possible. when they came out through the french window, there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice, right in front of their noses. could there be a better hiding-place?” “ah, a hiding-place—that is better!” cried stanley hopkins. “yes, yes, i see it all now! it was early, there were folk upon the roads, they were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond, intending to return for it when the coast was clear. excellent, mr. holmes—that is better than your idea of a blind.” “quite so, you have got an admirable theory. i have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver.” “yes, sir—yes. it was all your doing. but i have had a bad setback.” “a setback?” “yes, mr. holmes. the randall gang were arrested in new york this morning.” “dear me, hopkins! that is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in kent last night.” “it is fatal, mr. holmes—absolutely fatal. still, there are other gangs of three besides the randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard.” “quite so, it is perfectly possible. what, are you off?” “yes, mr. holmes, there is no rest for me until i have got to the bottom of the business. i suppose you have no hint to give me?” “i have given you one.” “which?” “well, i suggested a blind.” “but why, mr. holmes, why?” “ah, that’s the question, of course. but i commend the idea to your mind. you might possibly find that there was something in it. you won’t stop for dinner? well, good-bye, and let us know how you get on.” dinner was over, and the table cleared before holmes alluded to the matter again. he had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. suddenly he looked at his watch. “i expect developments, watson.” “when?” “now—within a few minutes. i dare say you thought i acted rather badly to stanley hopkins just now?” “i trust your judgment.” “a very sensible reply, watson. you must look at it this way: what i know is unofficial, what he knows is official. i have the right to private judgment, but he has none. he must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. in a doubtful case i would not put him in so painful a position, and so i reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter.” “but when will that be?” “the time has come. you will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama.” there was a sound upon the stairs, and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. he was a very tall young man, golden-moustached, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns, and a springy step, which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong. he closed the door behind him, and then he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking down some overmastering emotion. “sit down, captain crocker. you got my telegram?” our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes. “i got your telegram, and i came at the hour you said. i heard that you had been down to the office. there was no getting away from you. let’s hear the worst. what are you going to do with me? arrest me? speak out, man! you can’t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.” “give him a cigar,” said holmes. “bite on that, captain crocker, and don’t let your nerves run away with you. i should not sit here smoking with you if i thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure of that. be frank with me and we may do some good. play tricks with me, and i’ll crush you.” “what do you wish me to do?” “to give me a true account of all that happened at the abbey grange last night—a _true_ account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken off. i know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight, i’ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands forever.” the sailor thought for a little. then he struck his leg with his great sunburned hand. “i’ll chance it,” he cried. “i believe you are a man of your word, and a white man, and i’ll tell you the whole story. but one thing i will say first. so far as i am concerned, i regret nothing and i fear nothing, and i would do it all again and be proud of the job. damn the beast, if he had as many lives as a cat, he would owe them all to me! but it’s the lady, mary—mary fraser—for never will i call her by that accursed name. when i think of getting her into trouble, i who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face, it’s that that turns my soul into water. and yet—and yet—what less could i do? i’ll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then i’ll ask you, as man to man, what less could i do? “i must go back a bit. you seem to know everything, so i expect that you know that i met her when she was a passenger and i was first officer of the _rock of gibraltar_. from the first day i met her, she was the only woman to me. every day of that voyage i loved her more, and many a time since have i kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because i knew her dear feet had trod it. she was never engaged to me. she treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. i have no complaint to make. it was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. when we parted she was a free woman, but i could never again be a free man. “next time i came back from sea, i heard of her marriage. well, why shouldn’t she marry whom she liked? title and money—who could carry them better than she? she was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. i didn’t grieve over her marriage. i was not such a selfish hound as that. i just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and that she had not thrown herself away on a penniless sailor. that’s how i loved mary fraser. “well, i never thought to see her again, but last voyage i was promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so i had to wait for a couple of months with my people at sydenham. one day out in a country lane i met theresa wright, her old maid. she told me all about her, about him, about everything. i tell you, gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. this drunken hound, that he should dare to raise his hand to her, whose boots he was not worthy to lick! i met theresa again. then i met mary herself—and met her again. then she would meet me no more. but the other day i had a notice that i was to start on my voyage within a week, and i determined that i would see her once before i left. theresa was always my friend, for she loved mary and hated this villain almost as much as i did. from her i learned the ways of the house. mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. i crept round there last night and scratched at the window. at first she would not open to me, but in her heart i know that now she loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. she whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and i found it open before me, so as to let me into the dining-room. again i heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil, and again i cursed this brute who mishandled the woman i loved. well, gentlemen, i was standing with her just inside the window, in all innocence, as god is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman, and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. i had sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. see here, on my arm, where his first blow fell. then it was my turn, and i went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. do you think i was sorry? not i! it was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could i leave her in the power of this madman? that was how i killed him. was i wrong? well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position? “she had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old theresa down from the room above. there was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and i opened it and poured a little between mary’s lips, for she was half dead with shock. then i took a drop myself. theresa was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. we must make it appear that burglars had done the thing. theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while i swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. then i lashed her in her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural, else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. then i gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to carry out the idea of the robbery, and there i left them, with orders to give the alarm when i had a quarter of an hour’s start. i dropped the silver into the pond, and made off for sydenham, feeling that for once in my life i had done a real good night’s work. and that’s the truth and the whole truth, mr. holmes, if it costs me my neck.” holmes smoked for some time in silence. then he crossed the room, and shook our visitor by the hand. “that’s what i think,” said he. “i know that every word is true, for you have hardly said a word which i did not know. no one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell-rope from the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair. only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class of life, since she was trying hard to shield him, and so showing that she loved him. you see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once i had started upon the right trail.” “i thought the police never could have seen through our dodge.” “and the police haven’t, nor will they, to the best of my belief. now, look here, captain crocker, this is a very serious matter, though i am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected. i am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate. however, that is for a british jury to decide. meanwhile i have so much sympathy for you that, if you choose to disappear in the next twenty-four hours, i will promise you that no one will hinder you.” “and then it will all come out?” “certainly it will come out.” the sailor flushed with anger. “what sort of proposal is that to make a man? i know enough of law to understand that mary would be held as accomplice. do you think i would leave her alone to face the music while i slunk away? no, sir, let them do their worst upon me, but for heaven’s sake, mr. holmes, find some way of keeping my poor mary out of the courts.” holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor. “i was only testing you, and you ring true every time. well, it is a great responsibility that i take upon myself, but i have given hopkins an excellent hint and if he can’t avail himself of it i can do no more. see here, captain crocker, we’ll do this in due form of law. you are the prisoner. watson, you are a british jury, and i never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. i am the judge. now, gentleman of the jury, you have heard the evidence. do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?” “not guilty, my lord,” said i. “_vox populi, vox dei_. you are acquitted, captain crocker. so long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me. come back to this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night!” the adventure of the second stain i had intended “the adventure of the abbey grange” to be the last of those exploits of my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, which i should ever communicate to the public. this resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material, since i have notes of many hundreds of cases to which i have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man. the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr. holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. so long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him, but since he has definitely retired from london and betaken himself to study and bee-farming on the sussex downs, notoriety has become hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed. it was only upon my representing to him that i had given a promise that “the adventure of the second stain” should be published when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle, that i at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public. if in telling the story i seem to be somewhat vague in certain details, the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence. it was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless, that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of european fame within the walls of our humble room in baker street. the one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than the illustrious lord bellinger, twice premier of britain. the other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was the right honourable trelawney hope, secretary for european affairs, and the most rising statesman in the country. they sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them. the premier’s thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from holmes to me. the european secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain. “when i discovered my loss, mr. holmes, which was at eight o’clock this morning, i at once informed the prime minister. it was at his suggestion that we have both come to you.” “have you informed the police?” “no, sir,” said the prime minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. “we have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. to inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. this is what we particularly desire to avoid.” “and why, sir?” “because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily—i might almost say probably—lead to european complications of the utmost moment. it is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known.” “i understand. now, mr. trelawney hope, i should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared.” “that can be done in a very few words, mr. holmes. the letter—for it was a letter from a foreign potentate—was received six days ago. it was of such importance that i have never left it in my safe, but have taken it across each evening to my house in whitehall terrace, and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. it was there last night. of that i am certain. i actually opened the box while i was dressing for dinner and saw the document inside. this morning it was gone. the despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. i am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. we are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night. and yet i repeat that the paper is gone.” “what time did you dine?” “half-past seven.” “how long was it before you went to bed?” “my wife had gone to the theatre. i waited up for her. it was half-past eleven before we went to our room.” “then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?” “no one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house-maid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest of the day. they are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time. besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch-box.” “who did know of the existence of that letter?” “no one in the house.” “surely your wife knew?” “no, sir. i had said nothing to my wife until i missed the paper this morning.” the premier nodded approvingly. “i have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,” said he. “i am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.” the european secretary bowed. “you do me no more than justice, sir. until this morning i have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.” “could she have guessed?” “no, mr. holmes, she could not have guessed—nor could anyone have guessed.” “have you lost any documents before?” “no, sir.” “who is there in england who did know of the existence of this letter?” “each member of the cabinet was informed of it yesterday, but the pledge of secrecy which attends every cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the prime minister. good heavens, to think that within a few hours i should myself have lost it!” his handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands tore at his hair. for a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. the next the aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned. “besides the members of the cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who know of the letter. no one else in england, mr. holmes, i assure you.” “but abroad?” “i believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. i am well convinced that his ministers—that the usual official channels have not been employed.” holmes considered for some little time. “now, sir, i must ask you more particularly what this document is, and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?” the two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the premier’s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown. “mr. holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. there is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. it is addressed in large, bold handwriting to——” “i fear, sir,” said holmes, “that, interesting and indeed essential as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. what _was_ the letter?” “that is a state secret of the utmost importance, and i fear that i cannot tell you, nor do i see that it is necessary. if by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as i describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.” sherlock holmes rose with a smile. “you are two of the most busy men in the country,” said he, “and in my own small way i have also a good many calls upon me. i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time.” the premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his deep-set eyes before which a cabinet has cowered. “i am not accustomed, sir,” he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. for a minute or more we all sat in silence. then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders. “we must accept your terms, mr. holmes. no doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence.” “i agree with you,” said the younger statesman. “then i will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague, dr. watson. i may appeal to your patriotism also, for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out.” “you may safely trust us.” “the letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this country. it has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely. inquiries have shown that his ministers know nothing of the matter. at the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country. there would be such a ferment, sir, that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war.” holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the premier. “exactly. it was he. and it is this letter—this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men—which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.” “have you informed the sender?” “yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.” “perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.” “no, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out.” “if this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out? why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?” “there, mr. holmes, you take me into regions of high international politics. but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive. the whole of europe is an armed camp. there is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power. great britain holds the scales. if britain were driven into war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. do you follow?” “very clearly. it is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?” “yes, sir.” “and to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?” “to any of the great chancelleries of europe. it is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.” mr. trelawney hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. the premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder. “it is your misfortune, my dear fellow. no one can blame you. there is no precaution which you have neglected. now, mr. holmes, you are in full possession of the facts. what course do you recommend?” holmes shook his head mournfully. “you think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be war?” “i think it is very probable.” “then, sir, prepare for war.” “that is a hard saying, mr. holmes.” “consider the facts, sir. it is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since i understand that mr. hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. it was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible. now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at that hour, where can it be now? no one has any reason to retain it. it has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. what chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? it is beyond our reach.” the prime minister rose from the settee. “what you say is perfectly logical, mr. holmes. i feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.” “let us presume, for argument’s sake, that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet——” “they are both old and tried servants.” “i understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go up unobserved. it must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it. to whom would the thief take it? to one of several international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. there are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession. i will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post. if one is missing—especially if he has disappeared since last night—we will have some indication as to where the document has gone.” “why should he be missing?” asked the european secretary. “he would take the letter to an embassy in london, as likely as not.” “i fancy not. these agents work independently, and their relations with the embassies are often strained.” the prime minister nodded his acquiescence. “i believe you are right, mr. holmes. he would take so valuable a prize to headquarters with his own hands. i think that your course of action is an excellent one. meanwhile, hope, we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune. should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.” the two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room. when our illustrious visitors had departed holmes lit his pipe in silence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. i had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in london the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece. “yes,” said he, “there is no better way of approaching it. the situation is desperate, but not hopeless. even now, if we could be sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands. after all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and i have the british treasury behind me. if it’s on the market i’ll buy it—if it means another penny on the income-tax. it is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other. there are only those three capable of playing so bold a game—there are oberstein, la rothiere, and eduardo lucas. i will see each of them.” i glanced at my morning paper. “is that eduardo lucas of godolphin street?” “yes.” “you will not see him.” “why not?” “he was murdered in his house last night.” my friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that i realized how completely i had astonished him. he stared in amazement, and then snatched the paper from my hands. this was the paragraph which i had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair: murder in westminster a crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16, godolphin street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth century houses which lie between the river and the abbey, almost in the shadow of the great tower of the houses of parliament. this small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by mr. eduardo lucas, well-known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country. mr. lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists of mrs. pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of mitton, his valet. the former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house. the valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at hammersmith. from ten o’clock onward mr. lucas had the house to himself. what occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve police-constable barrett, passing along godolphin street observed that the door of no. 16 was ajar. he knocked, but received no answer. perceiving a light in the front room, he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. he then pushed open the door and entered. the room was in a state of wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one chair lying on its back in the centre. beside this chair, and still grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. he had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. the knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved indian dagger, plucked down from a trophy of oriental arms which adorned one of the walls. robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room. mr. eduardo lucas was so well-known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a widespread circle of friends. “well, watson, what do you make of this?” asked holmes, after a long pause. “it is an amazing coincidence.” “a coincidence! here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. the odds are enormous against its being coincidence. no figures could express them. no, my dear watson, the two events are connected—_must_ be connected. it is for us to find the connection.” “but now the official police must know all.” “not at all. they know all they see at godolphin street. they know—and shall know—nothing of whitehall terrace. only _we_ know of both events, and can trace the relation between them. there is one obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against lucas. godolphin street, westminster, is only a few minutes’ walk from whitehall terrace. the other secret agents whom i have named live in the extreme west end. it was easier, therefore, for lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the european secretary’s household—a small thing, and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential. halloa! what have we here?” mrs. hudson had appeared with a lady’s card upon her salver. holmes glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me. “ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step up,” said he. a moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in london. i had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the duke of belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. and yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer. the cheek was lovely but it was paled with emotion, the eyes were bright but it was the brightness of fever, the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self-command. terror—not beauty—was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door. “has my husband been here, mr. holmes?” “yes, madam, he has been here.” “mr. holmes. i implore you not to tell him that i came here.” holmes bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair. “your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. i beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire, but i fear that i cannot make any unconditional promise.” she swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window. it was a queenly presence—tall, graceful, and intensely womanly. “mr. holmes,” she said—and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke—“i will speak frankly to you in the hopes that it may induce you to speak frankly in return. there is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. that one is politics. on this his lips are sealed. he tells me nothing. now, i am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night. i know that a paper has disappeared. but because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence. now it is essential—essential, i say—that i should thoroughly understand it. you are the only other person, save only these politicians, who knows the true facts. i beg you then, mr. holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to. tell me all, mr. holmes. let no regard for your client’s interests keep you silent, for i assure you that his interests, if he would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence. what was this paper which was stolen?” “madam, what you ask me is really impossible.” she groaned and sank her face in her hands. “you must see that this is so, madam. if your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld? it is not fair to ask it. it is him whom you must ask.” “i have asked him. i come to you as a last resource. but without your telling me anything definite, mr. holmes, you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point.” “what is it, madam?” “is my husband’s political career likely to suffer through this incident?” “well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect.” “ah!” she drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved. “one more question, mr. holmes. from an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster i understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document.” “if he said so, i certainly cannot deny it.” “of what nature are they?” “nay, madam, there again you ask me more than i can possibly answer.” “then i will take up no more of your time. i cannot blame you, mr. holmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side will not, i am sure, think the worse of me because i desire, even against his will, to share my husband’s anxieties. once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit.” she looked back at us from the door, and i had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. then she was gone. “now, watson, the fair sex is your department,” said holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling _frou-frou_ of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door. “what was the fair lady’s game? what did she really want?” “surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.” “hum! think of her appearance, watson—her manner, her suppressed excitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.” “she was certainly much moved.” “remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all. what did she mean by that? and you must have observed, watson, how she manœuvred to have the light at her back. she did not wish us to read her expression.” “yes, she chose the one chair in the room.” “and yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. you remember the woman at margate whom i suspected for the same reason. no powder on her nose—that proved to be the correct solution. how can you build on such a quicksand? their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs. good-morning, watson.” “you are off?” “yes, i will while away the morning at godolphin street with our friends of the regular establishment. with eduardo lucas lies the solution of our problem, though i must admit that i have not an inkling as to what form it may take. it is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts. do you stay on guard, my good watson, and receive any fresh visitors. i’ll join you at lunch if i am able.” all that day and the next and the next holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn, and others morose. he ran out and ran in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual questions which i put to him. it was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest. he would say nothing of the case, and it was from the papers that i learned the particulars of the inquest, and the arrest with the subsequent release of john mitton, the valet of the deceased. the coroner’s jury brought in the obvious wilful murder, but the parties remained as unknown as ever. no motive was suggested. the room was full of articles of value, but none had been taken. the dead man’s papers had not been tampered with. they were carefully examined, and showed that he was a keen student of international politics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an untiring letter writer. he had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries. but nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers. as to his relations with women, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. he had many acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he loved. his habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. his death was an absolute mystery and likely to remain so. as to the arrest of john mitton, the valet, it was a council of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction. but no case could be sustained against him. he had visited friends in hammersmith that night. the _alibi_ was complete. it is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to westminster before the time when the crime was discovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. he had actually arrived at twelve o’clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy. he had always been on good terms with his master. several of the dead man’s possessions—notably a small case of razors—had been found in the valet’s boxes, but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story. mitton had been in lucas’s employment for three years. it was noticeable that lucas did not take mitton on the continent with him. sometimes he visited paris for three months on end, but mitton was left in charge of the godolphin street house. as to the housekeeper, she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. if her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him. so for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as i could follow it in the papers. if holmes knew more, he kept his own counsel, but, as he told me that inspector lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case, i knew that he was in close touch with every development. upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from paris which seemed to solve the whole question. a discovery has just been made by the parisian police (said the _daily telegraph_) which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of mr. eduardo lucas, who met his death by violence last monday night at godolphin street, westminster. our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some suspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an _alibi_. yesterday a lady, who has been known as mme. henri fournaye, occupying a small villa in the rue austerlitz, was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane. an examination showed she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form. on inquiry, the police have discovered that mme. henri fournaye only returned from a journey to london on tuesday last, and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at westminster. a comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that m. henri fournaye and eduardo lucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in london and paris. mme. fournaye, who is of creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy. it is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in london. her movements upon the monday night have not yet been traced, but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at charing cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures. it is probable, therefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. at present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the doctors hold out no hopes of the reestablishment of her reason. there is evidence that a woman, who might have been mme. fournaye, was seen for some hours upon monday night watching the house in godolphin street. “what do you think of that, holmes?” i had read the account aloud to him, while he finished his breakfast. “my dear watson,” said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room, “you are most long-suffering, but if i have told you nothing in the last three days, it is because there is nothing to tell. even now this report from paris does not help us much.” “surely it is final as regards the man’s death.” “the man’s death is a mere incident—a trivial episode—in comparison with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a european catastrophe. only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. i get reports almost hourly from the government, and it is certain that nowhere in europe is there any sign of trouble. now, if this letter were loose—no, it _can’t_ be loose—but if it isn’t loose, where can it be? who has it? why is it held back? that’s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. was it, indeed, a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? did the letter ever reach him? if so, why is it not among his papers? did this mad wife of his carry it off with her? if so, is it in her house in paris? how could i search for it without the french police having their suspicions aroused? it is a case, my dear watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. every man’s hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. should i bring it to a successful conclusion, it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. ah, here is my latest from the front!” he glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. “halloa! lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. put on your hat, watson, and we will stroll down together to westminster.” it was my first visit to the scene of the crime—a high, dingy, narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which gave it birth. lestrade’s bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in. the room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained save an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. this carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful, old-fashioned wood-flooring in square blocks, highly polished. over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of which had been used on that tragic night. in the window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy. “seen the paris news?” asked lestrade. holmes nodded. “our french friends seem to have touched the spot this time. no doubt it’s just as they say. she knocked at the door—surprise visit, i guess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments—he let her in, couldn’t keep her in the street. she told him how she had traced him, reproached him. one thing led to another, and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. it wasn’t all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it. we’ve got it all clear as if we had seen it.” holmes raised his eyebrows. “and yet you have sent for me?” “ah, yes, that’s another matter—a mere trifle, but the sort of thing you take an interest in—queer, you know, and what you might call freakish. it has nothing to do with the main fact—can’t have, on the face of it.” “what is it, then?” “well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position. nothing has been moved. officer in charge here day and night. this morning, as the man was buried and the investigation over—so far as this room is concerned—we thought we could tidy up a bit. this carpet. you see, it is not fastened down, only just laid there. we had occasion to raise it. we found——” “yes? you found——” holmes’s face grew tense with anxiety. “well, i’m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find. you see that stain on the carpet? well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?” “undoubtedly it must.” “well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.” “no stain! but there must——” “yes, so you would say. but the fact remains that there isn’t.” he took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed as he said. “but the under side is as stained as the upper. it must have left a mark.” lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert. “now, i’ll show you the explanation. there _is_ a second stain, but it does not correspond with the other. see for yourself.” as he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. “what do you make of that, mr. holmes?” “why, it is simple enough. the two stains did correspond, but the carpet has been turned round. as it was square and unfastened it was easily done.” “the official police don’t need you, mr. holmes, to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round. that’s clear enough, for the stains lie above each other—if you lay it over this way. but what i want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?” i could see from holmes’s rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement. “look here, lestrade,” said he, “has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time?” “yes, he has.” “well, take my advice. examine him carefully. don’t do it before us. we’ll wait here. you take him into the back room. you’ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone. ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. don’t ask him if he has done it. take it for granted. tell him you _know_ someone has been here. press him. tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness. do exactly what i tell you!” “by george, if he knows i’ll have it out of him!” cried lestrade. he darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room. “now, watson, now!” cried holmes with frenzied eagerness. all the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy. he tore the drugget from the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it. one turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it. it hinged back like the lid of a box. a small black cavity opened beneath it. holmes plunged his eager hand into it and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. it was empty. “quick, watson, quick! get it back again!” the wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when lestrade’s voice was heard in the passage. he found holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns. “sorry to keep you waiting, mr. holmes, i can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair. well, he has confessed, all right. come in here, macpherson. let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct.” the big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room. “i meant no harm, sir, i’m sure. the young woman came to the door last evening—mistook the house, she did. and then we got talking. it’s lonesome, when you’re on duty here all day.” “well, what happened then?” “she wanted to see where the crime was done—had read about it in the papers, she said. she was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman, sir, and i saw no harm in letting her have a peep. when she saw that mark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she were dead. i ran to the back and got some water, but i could not bring her to. then i went round the corner to the ivy plant for some brandy, and by the time i had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off—ashamed of herself, i daresay, and dared not face me.” “how about moving that drugget?” “well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when i came back. you see, she fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place. i straightened it out afterwards.” “it’s a lesson to you that you can’t deceive me, constable macpherson,” said lestrade, with dignity. “no doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room. it’s lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find yourself in queer street. i’m sorry to have called you down over such a petty business, mr. holmes, but i thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you.” “certainly, it was most interesting. has this woman only been here once, constable?” “yes, sir, only once.” “who was she?” “don’t know the name, sir. was answering an advertisement about typewriting and came to the wrong number—very pleasant, genteel young woman, sir.” “tall? handsome?” “yes, sir, she was a well-grown young woman. i suppose you might say she was handsome. perhaps some would say she was very handsome. ‘oh, officer, do let me have a peep!’ says she. she had pretty, coaxing ways, as you might say, and i thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door.” “how was she dressed?” “quiet, sir—a long mantle down to her feet.” “what time was it?” “it was just growing dusk at the time. they were lighting the lamps as i came back with the brandy.” “very good,” said holmes. “come, watson, i think that we have more important work elsewhere.” as we left the house lestrade remained in the front room, while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out. holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand. the constable stared intently. “good lord, sir!” he cried, with amazement on his face. holmes put his finger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast pocket, and burst out laughing as we turned down the street. “excellent!” said he. “come, friend watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. you will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the prime minister will have no european complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident.” my mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man. “you have solved it!” i cried. “hardly that, watson. there are some points which are as dark as ever. but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest. we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head.” when we arrived at the residence of the european secretary it was for lady hilda trelawney hope that sherlock holmes inquired. we were shown into the morning-room. “mr. holmes!” said the lady, and her face was pink with her indignation. “this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. i desired, as i have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband should think that i was intruding into his affairs. and yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us.” “unfortunately, madam, i had no possible alternative. i have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper. i must therefore ask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.” the lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face. her eyes glazed—she tottered—i thought that she would faint. then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock, and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features. “you—you insult me, mr. holmes.” “come, come, madam, it is useless. give up the letter.” she darted to the bell. “the butler shall show you out.” “do not ring, lady hilda. if you do, then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated. give up the letter and all will be set right. if you will work with me i can arrange everything. if you work against me i must expose you.” she stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul. her hand was on the bell, but she had forborne to ring it. “you are trying to frighten me. it is not a very manly thing, mr. holmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. you say that you know something. what is it that you know?” “pray sit down, madam. you will hurt yourself there if you fall. i will not speak until you sit down. thank you.” “i give you five minutes, mr. holmes.” “one is enough, lady hilda. i know of your visit to eduardo lucas, of your giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room last night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding-place under the carpet.” she stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak. “you are mad, mr. holmes—you are mad!” she cried, at last. he drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. it was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait. “i have carried this because i thought it might be useful,” said he. “the policeman has recognized it.” she gave a gasp, and her head dropped back in the chair. “come, lady hilda. you have the letter. the matter may still be adjusted. i have no desire to bring trouble to you. my duty ends when i have returned the lost letter to your husband. take my advice and be frank with me. it is your only chance.” her courage was admirable. even now she would not own defeat. “i tell you again, mr. holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.” holmes rose from his chair. “i am sorry for you, lady hilda. i have done my best for you. i can see that it is all in vain.” he rang the bell. the butler entered. “is mr. trelawney hope at home?” “he will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.” holmes glanced at his watch. “still a quarter of an hour,” said he. “very good, i shall wait.” the butler had hardly closed the door behind him when lady hilda was down on her knees at holmes’s feet, her hands outstretched, her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears. “oh, spare me, mr. holmes! spare me!” she pleaded, in a frenzy of supplication. “for heaven’s sake, don’t tell him! i love him so! i would not bring one shadow on his life, and this i know would break his noble heart.” holmes raised the lady. “i am thankful, madam, that you have come to your senses even at this last moment! there is not an instant to lose. where is the letter?” she darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long blue envelope. “here it is, mr. holmes. would to heaven i had never seen it!” “how can we return it?” holmes muttered. “quick, quick, we must think of some way! where is the despatch-box?” “still in his bedroom.” “what a stroke of luck! quick, madam, bring it here!” a moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand. “how did you open it before? you have a duplicate key? yes, of course you have. open it!” from out of her bosom lady hilda had drawn a small key. the box flew open. it was stuffed with papers. holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document. the box was shut, locked, and returned to the bedroom. “now we are ready for him,” said holmes. “we have still ten minutes. i am going far to screen you, lady hilda. in return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair.” “mr. holmes, i will tell you everything,” cried the lady. “oh, mr. holmes, i would cut off my right hand before i gave him a moment of sorrow! there is no woman in all london who loves her husband as i do, and yet if he knew how i have acted—how i have been compelled to act—he would never forgive me. for his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. help me, mr. holmes! my happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!” “quick, madam, the time grows short!” “it was a letter of mine, mr. holmes, an indiscreet letter written before my marriage—a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. i meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. had he read that letter his confidence would have been forever destroyed. it is years since i wrote it. i had thought that the whole matter was forgotten. then at last i heard from this man, lucas, that it had passed into his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. i implored his mercy. he said that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband’s despatch-box. he had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence. he assured me that no harm could come to my husband. put yourself in my position, mr. holmes! what was i to do?” “take your husband into your confidence.” “i could not, mr. holmes, i could not! on the one side seemed certain ruin, on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband’s paper, still in a matter of politics i could not understand the consequences, while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me. i did it, mr. holmes! i took an impression of his key. this man, lucas, furnished a duplicate. i opened his despatch-box, took the paper, and conveyed it to godolphin street.” “what happened there, madam?” “i tapped at the door as agreed. lucas opened it. i followed him into his room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for i feared to be alone with the man. i remember that there was a woman outside as i entered. our business was soon done. he had my letter on his desk, i handed him the document. he gave me the letter. at this instant there was a sound at the door. there were steps in the passage. lucas quickly turned back the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and covered it over. “what happened after that is like some fearful dream. i have a vision of a dark, frantic face, of a woman’s voice, which screamed in french, ‘my waiting is not in vain. at last, at last i have found you with her!’ there was a savage struggle. i saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife gleamed in hers. i rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house, and only next morning in the paper did i learn the dreadful result. that night i was happy, for i had my letter, and i had not seen yet what the future would bring. “it was the next morning that i realized that i had only exchanged one trouble for another. my husband’s anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart. i could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what i had done. but that again would mean a confession of the past. i came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence. from the instant that i grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband’s paper. it must still be where lucas had placed it, for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. if it had not been for her coming, i should not have known where his hiding-place was. how was i to get into the room? for two days i watched the place, but the door was never left open. last night i made a last attempt. what i did and how i succeeded, you have already learned. i brought the paper back with me, and thought of destroying it, since i could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband. heavens, i hear his step upon the stair!” the european secretary burst excitedly into the room. “any news, mr. holmes, any news?” he cried. “i have some hopes.” “ah, thank heaven!” his face became radiant. “the prime minister is lunching with me. may he share your hopes? he has nerves of steel, and yet i know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. jacobs, will you ask the prime minister to come up? as to you, dear, i fear that this is a matter of politics. we will join you in a few minutes in the dining-room.” the prime minister’s manner was subdued, but i could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague. “i understand that you have something to report, mr. holmes?” “purely negative as yet,” my friend answered. “i have inquired at every point where it might be, and i am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended.” “but that is not enough, mr. holmes. we cannot live forever on such a volcano. we must have something definite.” “i am in hopes of getting it. that is why i am here. the more i think of the matter the more convinced i am that the letter has never left this house.” “mr. holmes!” “if it had it would certainly have been public by now.” “but why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?” “i am not convinced that anyone did take it.” “then how could it leave the despatch-box?” “i am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch-box.” “mr. holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. you have my assurance that it left the box.” “have you examined the box since tuesday morning?” “no. it was not necessary.” “you may conceivably have overlooked it.” “impossible, i say.” “but i am not convinced of it. i have known such things to happen. i presume there are other papers there. well, it may have got mixed with them.” “it was on the top.” “someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.” “no, no, i had everything out.” “surely it is easily decided, hope,” said the premier. “let us have the despatch-box brought in.” the secretary rang the bell. “jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. this is a farcical waste of time, but still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. thank you, jacobs, put it here. i have always had the key on my watch-chain. here are the papers, you see. letter from lord merrow, report from sir charles hardy, memorandum from belgrade, note on the russo-german grain taxes, letter from madrid, note from lord flowers——good heavens! what is this? lord bellinger! lord bellinger!” the premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand. “yes, it is it—and the letter is intact. hope, i congratulate you.” “thank you! thank you! what a weight from my heart. but this is inconceivable—impossible. mr. holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! how did you know it was there?” “because i knew it was nowhere else.” “i cannot believe my eyes!” he ran wildly to the door. “where is my wife? i must tell her that all is well. hilda! hilda!” we heard his voice on the stairs. the premier looked at holmes with twinkling eyes. “come, sir,” said he. “there is more in this than meets the eye. how came the letter back in the box?” holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes. “we also have our diplomatic secrets,” said he and, picking up his hat, he turned to the door. the end
